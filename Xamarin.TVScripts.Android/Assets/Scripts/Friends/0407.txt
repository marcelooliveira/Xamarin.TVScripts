2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey and Chandler are there eating breakfast.]
3	Chandler	 (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
4	Ross	 Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.
5	Chandler	 It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)
6		(Pause)
7	Phoebe	 Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
8	All	 Yeah! Oh my God!
9		Opening Credits
10	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler watches from the doorway.]
11	Casey	 Here you go.
12	Joey	 Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.
13	Casey	 Great! (leaves)
14	Chandler	 (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
15	Joey	 That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
16	Chandler	 Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
17	Joey	 No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
18	Chandler	 (shocked) What?
19	Joey	 Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)
20	Chandler	 Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
21	Joey	 Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
22	Chandler	 Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)
23	Joey	 What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
24	Chandler	 Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.
25	Joey	 You got all that from the back of her head?
26	Chandler	 All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
27	Joey	 Who’s Elaine?
28	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards, and Phoebe is working on a new song.]
29	Phoebe	 (singing) "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.
30	Ross	 Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
31	Phoebe	 Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’
32	Ross	 Well umm, y’know, I used to play.
33	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?
34	Ross	 Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.
35		(Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)
36	Monica	 Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
37	Ross	 Yeah.
38	Monica	 He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
39	Phoebe	 I wanna hear "The Sound."
40	Ross	 Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?
41	Phoebe	 Come on, play that funky music white boy.
42	Monica	 Yeah!
43	Ross	 No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)
44		[Cut to later that same day, Ross has retrieved his keyboard and is about to debut, "The Sound."]
45	Ross	 Okay, guys.
46	Chandler	 All right! Bring it on, you…
47	Ross	 Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…
48	Chandler	 (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
49		(Ross starts to play. He plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. Over the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam, someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes, and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. Basically, the music sucks.)
50	Monica	 (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.
51	Chandler	 Really, bitchin’!
52	Phoebe	 Wow, it was so—wow!
53	Ross	 Really?! I mean, really?!!
54	Rachel	 Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
55	Ross	 Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so… (starts to break up and leaves)
56	Monica	 Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
57	Rachel	 Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
58	Phoebe	 What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.
59	Chandler	 You mean like, music?
60	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching Yasmein Bleeth running on TV, and the duck starts quacking.]
61	Chandler	 Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
62		(There’s a knock on the door.)
63	Chandler	 Come in!
64	Kathy	 (entering) Hey! (sees what’s on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?
65	Chandler	 Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
66	Kathy	 So is Joey around?
67	Chandler	 No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
68	Kathy	 I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?
69	Chandler	 I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
70	Joey	 (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
71	Chandler	 What happened?
72	Joey	 We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.
73	Chandler	 Why can’t you tell her?
74	Joey	 ‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)
75	Chandler	 Joey! Joey!!
76	Joey	 Yeah?
77	Chandler	 I thought your time ran out.
78	Joey	 Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)
79	Chandler	 (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.
80	Kathy	 Oh.
81	Chandler	 So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.
82	Kathy	 Oh, okay.
83	Chandler	 Yeah, I think it is!
84	Kathy	 So what did you do today?
85	Chandler	 Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…
86	Kathy	 (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!
87	Chandler	 …and then it got canceled.
88	Kathy	 Well, I could cut it.
89	Chandler	 Really?! You do that?
90	Kathy	 Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
91	Chandler	 Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.
92		[Cut to later, Kathy is cutting Chandler’s hair.]
93	Kathy	 You have really great hair.
94	Chandler	 Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
95	Kathy	 Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I’m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
96		(Kathy leans in really close and Chandler mouths "Oh my God." She moves around in front of him and kneels at his feet.)
97	Chandler	 What-what ‘cha doin’?
98	Kathy	 Checking to see if it’s even.
99	Chandler	 ‘Kay.
100	Kathy	 Looks good.
101		(They lean in to kiss and are interrupted by the phone.)
102	Chandler	 (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!
103	Joey	 (on phone) Hey dude, it’s me.
104	Chandler	 Hey it’s Joey!
105	Joey	 Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!
106	Chandler	 What?
107	Joey	 Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
108	Chandler	 Okay.
109	Joey	 Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
110	Chandler	 Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
111	Kathy	 (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no it’s fine, don’t worry about it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it’s okay. (listens) Yeah! I’ll talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.
112	Chandler	 Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
113		(Kathy leaves and Chandler groans in agony. Kathy knocks on the door and Chandler opens it.)
114	Kathy	 I forgot my purse.
115	Chandler	 Oh.
116		(They kiss, passionately.)
117	Kathy	 No, I really did forget my purse.
118		(They kiss again.)
119		Commercial Break
120	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, continued from earlier. Chandler and Kathy are still kissing, then they stop suddenly.]
121	Chandler	 No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!
122	Kathy	 Horrible!
123	Chandler	 Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
124	Kathy	 No-no-no, the kiss was good.
125	Chandler	 Okay!
126	Kathy	 No, but that’s bad!
127	Chandler	 Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.
128	Kathy	 What?!
129	Chandler	 Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?
130	Kathy	 Can you really do that?
131	Chandler	 I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.
132	Kathy	 Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you…
133	Chandler	 (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.
134	Kathy	 I’m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
135	Chandler	 I-I think we have too.
136	Kathy	 Okay. Bye.
137	Chandler	 Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?
138	Kathy	 (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)
139	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is performing, his music hasn’t improved.]
140	Ross	 (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…
141	Monica	 (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.
142	Phoebe	 (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
143		[cut back to Ross who finally finishes his so-called song with the same crash from before. He gets some applause, mainly ‘cause he’s done.]
144	Ross	 (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…
145	Monica	 (to Phoebe) Hey, aren’t you up next?
146	Phoebe	 Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.
147	Rachel	 Why not?
148	Phoebe	 I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
149	Monica	 Phoebe, Ross sucks!
150	Rachel	 Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
151	Phoebe	 Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
152		(Rachel and Monica look at each other, and agree on something without saying anything.)
153	Monica	 Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
154	Rachel	 Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!
155	Phoebe	 You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
156	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on it.]
157	Joey	 Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)
158	Chandler	 Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
159	Joey	 (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
160	Chandler	 I sure did.
161	Joey	 Why?
162	Chandler	 Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
163	Joey	 Well, you’re amazing.
164	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)
165	Joey	 (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
166	Chandler	 Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
167	Joey	 Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
168	Chandler	 Oh, I don’t know.
169	Joey	 Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.
170	Chandler	 You mean with Casey.
171	Joey	 No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.
172	Chandler	 Or Casey.
173	Joey	 No-no, Kathy.
174	Chandler	 Could be Casey.
175	Joey	 No. No, Kathy.
176	Chandler	 Consider Casey.
177	Joey	 Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
178	Chandler	 That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
179	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross has just finished playing.]
180	Ross	 (to Phoebe) Hey!
181	Phoebe	 Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
182	Ross	 Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
183	Phoebe	 Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
184	Ross	 Pheebs…
185	Phoebe	 Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…
186	Ross	 See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.
187	Phoebe	 Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
188	Ross	 Yeah, okay.
189	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are sitting on the couch and Phoebe is getting coffee as Chandler enters. Ross is also there.]
190	Ross	 Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
191	Monica	 Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
192	Chandler	 I kissed Kathy.
193	Ross	 What?
194	Monica	 Are you serious?
195	Phoebe	 Does Joey know?
196	Chandler	 No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?
197	Monica	 You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.
198	Ross	 No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.
199	Chandler	 Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
200	Phoebe	 I think maybe, yeah.
201	Monica	 He loves you.
202	Chandler	 Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
203	Ross	 Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
204	Phoebe	 Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
205	Rachel	 I know, I remember that!
206	Monica	 I remember you did.
207	Chandler	 God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
208	Rachel	 Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.
209	Chandler	 Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
210	Rachel	 Because you do.
211	Chandler	 Yeah, I know.
212	Ross	 Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
213	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.]
214	Chandler	 Hey!
215	Joey	 Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
216	Chandler	 Is that a real thing?
217	Joey	 Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
218	Chandler	 Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
219	Joey	 What’s up?
220	Chandler	 It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
221	Joey	 You do?
222	Chandler	 Yeah.
223	Joey	 Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.
224	Chandler	 What?
225	Joey	 Yeah, she broke up with me.
226	Chandler	 Oh uh, when?
227	Joey	 Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.
228	Chandler	 Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
229	Joey	 Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?
230	Chandler	 Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.
231	Joey	 No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.
232	Chandler	 Yeah?
233	Joey	 Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.
234	Chandler	 Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
235	Joey	 But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…
236	Chandler	 See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
237	Joey	 Who?
238	Chandler	 It’s me. I’m the other guy.
239	Joey	 What?
240	Chandler	 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…
241	Joey	 And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
242	Chandler	 No! No! No! I just kissed her.
243	Joey	 What?!! That’s even worse!!
244	Chandler	 How is that worse?!
245	Joey	 I don’t know! But it’s the same!
246	Chandler	 Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!
247	Joey	 Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
248	Chandler	 You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
249	Joey	 Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
250	Chandler	 Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
251	Joey	 Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like "Well, kinda.") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!
252	Chandler	 Probably because…
253	Joey	 Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)
254		Closing Credits
255	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is playing his music. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
256	Phoebe	 Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.
257	Monica	 (removing ear plugs) What?
258	Rachel	 Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
259		(Ross finally finishes with the same crash, and gets some applause.)
260	Ross	 Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?
261	Phoebe	 After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
262		(Phoebe gets up and goes to play, Ross goes over and sits down next to Monica and Rachel.)
263	Ross	 Yeah, like I could lose it.
264	Rachel	 What?
265	Ross	 I played bad on purpose guys.
266		(Both Monica and Rachel laugh.)
267	Monica	 Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
268	Ross	 Yeah—no, just that last song.
269		End
