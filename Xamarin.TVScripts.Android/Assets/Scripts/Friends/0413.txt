2	[Scene	 A Theatre, Chandler and Ross are there to watch the premiere of Kathy’s play.]
3	Chandler	 Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
4	Ross	 People can hear you.
5	Chandler	 I know!!
6		(The play starts.)
7	Chandler	 Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?
8	Ross	 Yeah.
9		(Onstage there’s a knock on the door and Kathy opens it. We don’t see what’s going on, only hear it.)
10	Kathy's Co-Star	 Hi!
11	Kathy	 Hi!
12	Ross	 That is one good looking man!
13	Chandler	 Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
14	Kathy's Co-Star	 Sooo, you’ve been doing this long?
15	Kathy	 No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table.
16		(Ross and Chandler have stunned looks on their faces as Kathy and her co-star start making out.)
17	Kathy's Co-Star	 Oh, yeah! Ooh, that’s nice. (They start making out harder.)
18	Ross	 Dude!
19	Kathy's Co-Star	 Is that an expensive blouse?
20	Kathy	 If you want it to be.
21		(Kathy’s co-star rips her blouse off and buttons go flying into the audience, and one hits Ross. Chandler’s mouth is on the floor.)
22	Ross	 Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)
23		Opening Credits
24	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is still unpacking after the move, and Phoebe is their also.]
25	Phoebe	 Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
26	Monica	 Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
27	Phoebe	 Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
28		(Rachel enters)
29	Monica	 Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.
30	Rachel	 Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
31	Monica	 Oh my God, are you out of a job?
32	Rachel	 No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
33	Phoebe	 Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
34	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
35	Phoebe	 That sounds great!
36	Joey	 (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
37	Monica	 Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
38	Joey	 (Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?
39	Monica	 If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)
40		(Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)
41	Monica	 What are you doing?
42	Joey	 I think I left a donut up here.
43	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey are already there.]
44	Ross	 Hey!
45	Phoebe	 Hey!
46	Joey	 Hey!
47	Phoebe	 Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?
48	Ross	 Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.
49	Chandler	 Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
50	Phoebe	 That’s a good idea for a business!
51	Chandler	 I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, "So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?" And she’ll go, "No-no-no, it’s Chandler." And he’ll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
52	Joey	 (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
53	Chandler	 All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
54	Joey	 Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.
55	Ross	 Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
56	Joey	 Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
57	Ross	 Yeah.
58	Phoebe	 Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
59	Ross	 They’re not a couple!
60	Phoebe	 Oh-okay, I get the game now.
61	Joey	 Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
62	Ross	 Oh yeah!
63	Joey	 Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.
64	Chandler	 Really?
65	Joey	 Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
66	Ross	 No.
67	Joey	 Noooo!!
68	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the gang minus Monica and Rachel are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]
69	Chandler	 So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
70	Ross	 Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
71	Chandler	 Yeah, I know but…
72	Ross	 Oh no-no-no, I’m there.
73	Monica	 (entering) Hey!
74	Joey	 Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
75	Monica	 You made pancakes?
76	Joey	 Yep! Grab a plate.
77	Monica	 Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)
78	Joey	 No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.
79	Chandler	 Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.
80	Joey	 Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
81	Ross	 Oh yeah!
82	Monica	 Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
83	Joey	 Oh yeah, who’s playing?
84	Monica	 The players.
85	Ross	 Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
86	Monica	 (laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.
87	Joey	 All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
88	Phoebe	 Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)
89	[Scene	 Bloomingdale’s, Rachel’s new job.]
90	Rachel	 (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
91	Mr. Waltham	 In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
92		(It’s a really good-looking man, Joshua, that Rachel has an instant crush on. Well actually it’s Tate Donovan, so it’s not like she’s really testing her acting skills.)
93	Rachel	 Hi!
94	Joshua	 Hi, I’m Joshua.
95	Rachel	 Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
96	Joshua	 Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…
97	Rachel	 Oh, I’m so sorry.
98		(He walks over to look and some clothes and Rachel quickly turns around and adjusts her bra, trying to show off her assets.)
99	Joshua	 Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
100	Rachel	 Well, at least that’s a great suit.
101	Joshua	 Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.
102	Rachel	 Okay.
103	Mr. Waltham	 Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
104	Rachel	 No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.
105		(He walks out and Rachel stares at his butt as he leaves. He makes a wrong turn.)
106	Rachel	 Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)
107	Joshua	 It’s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his butt.)
108	[Scene	 Kathy’s play, Ross and Chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the play.]
109	Chandler	 I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
110	Ross	 All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
111	Chandler	 Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
112	Ross	 Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.
113	Kathy	 Hey you guys!
114	Ross	 Hey!
115	Kathy	 Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
116	Ross	 Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)
117	Kathy	 Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?
118		(Chandler laughs without opening his mouth.)
119	Kathy	 It’s a good play, isn’t it?
120		(Chandler mumbles something, and Ross tells him to "Come on.")
121	Chandler	 Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.
122	Ross	 Okay, I… (Walks away.)
123	Kathy	 Clearly, I’m having sex with him?
124	Chandler	 Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
125	Kathy	 Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
126	Chandler	 Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.
127	Kathy	 Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
128	Chandler	 Well, you can understand, given how we started.
129	Kathy	 Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.
130	Chandler	 Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!
131	Kathy	 I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!
132	Chandler	 Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!
133		Commercial Break
134	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are there eating pizza as Rachel enters.]
135	Rachel	 I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
136	Phoebe	 Rachel has a new doll.
137	Rachel	 Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
138	Ross	 Uh, hello!
139	Rachel	 Hi-e!!
140	Phoebe	 Ooh, what do I smell?
141	Joey	 I don’t know, it smells good.
142		(He goes over and opens the door to reveal Monica holding a plate of cookies and a fan to blow the smell across the hall.)
143	Monica	 Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
144	Phoebe	 Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)
145	Monica	 Please, have some!
146	Ross	 Oh, yumm!
147	Monica	 Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
148	Joey	 (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
149	Monica	 Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.
150	Ross	 Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!
151		(Rachel laughs hysterically for no reason.)
152	Phoebe	 What? What?
153	Rachel	 Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
154	Ross	 Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
155	Rachel	 It’s Joshua.
156	Ross	 Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)
157	Monica	 Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!
158	Phoebe	 (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…
159	Monica	 No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!
160	Phoebe	 Yeah, I don’t need it.
161	Monica	 People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
162	Rachel	 Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
163	Monica	 I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
164	Phoebe	 Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
165	Monica	 ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.
166	Phoebe	 If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!
167	Rachel	 Yeah, that’s true.
168	Monica	 All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!
169	Phoebe	 Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
170		(Chandler comes back, obviously drunk, and trips over the steps.)
171	Chandler	 Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
172	All	 What?!
173	Ross	 So you were right?
174	Chandler	 I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
175	Ross	 Chandler!
176	Rachel	 Chandler, what did she say?
177	Phoebe	 Wait a minute.
178	Joey	 Come here.
179	Monica	 Are you sure?
180	Chandler	 Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…
181	Rachel	 Beefsteak Charlie’s?
182	Chandler	 Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)
183	[Scene	 The hallway between the apartments, Monica is lugging one of those floor polishing machines through the hallway. Rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees Monica.]
184	Rachel	 Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
185	Monica	 Nah, I got it.
186	Rachel	 Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)
187		[Cut to inside the apartment.]
188	Rachel	 Hi!
189	All	 Hey!
190	Rachel	 So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!
191	Phoebe	 Why don’t you ask him out?
192	Joey	 Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!
193	Rachel	 Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?
194	Joey	 Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.
195	Phoebe	 He just got a divorce right?
196	Rachel	 Hmm-mmm.
197	Phoebe	 So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
198	Rachel	 Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.
199	Phoebe	 (shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!
200	Rachel	 No. Have you?
201	Phoebe	 Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
202	Rachel	 I don’t even know how I would go about it.
203	Joey	 Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"
204	Phoebe	 Oh, please!
205	Joey	 (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?
206		(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)
207	Rachel	 You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?
208	Phoebe	 I’ve never done that.
209	Rachel	 Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
210	Joey	 Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!
211	Rachel	 Really?! You think that will work?
212	Joey	 Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?
213		(We hear a noise coming from Monica and Rachel’s apartment.)
214	Joey	 What the heck is that?
215		(They go open the door and reveal Monica being spun around on the floor polisher and getting the cord wrapped around her legs.)
216	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.]
217	Chandler	 Did she call?
218	Phoebe	 No, sorry.
219	Chandler	 All right, maybe I should call her.
220	Joey	 No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!
221	Ross	 He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.
222	Chandler	 Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
223	Ross	 How might you be wrong?
224	Chandler	 Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?
225	Joey	 Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
226	Chandler	 She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
227	Ross	 That’s all you’re basing this on?
228	Chandler	 That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
229	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
230	Chandler	 Oh my God!!
231	[Scene	 Bloomingdale’s, Rachel’s new job, she is waiting for Joshua and practising how to ask him out.]
232	Rachel	 Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
233	Joshua	 What do you think?
234	Rachel	 Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
235	Joshua	 Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the mirror.) Yeah?
236	Rachel	 Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?
237	Joshua	 I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I’m gonna wear it home.
238	Rachel	 Great.
239	Joshua	 All right, thank you so much for all your help.
240	Rachel	 Sure.
241	Joshua	 Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
242	Rachel	 Yeah-eah-ha!
243	Joshua	 Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.
244	Rachel	 Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!
245	Joshua	 Ah, that’s okay, thanks.
246	Rachel	 Okay.
247	Joshua	 Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime. (He goes out the door.)
248	Rachel	 Basketball!
249	Joshua	 (coming back in) I’m sorry.
250	Rachel	 I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.
251	Joshua	 Wow! That would be great.
252	Rachel	 Really?
253	Joshua	 Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)
254	Mr. Waltham	 Good morning.
255	Joshua	 Hi!
256		(Mr. Waltham admires Joshua’s butt as he leaves.)
257	[Scene	 Kathy’s apartment, Chandler is knocking on the door.]
258	Kathy	 (opening the door) Hey.
259	Chandler	 Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
260	Kathy	 Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.
261	Chandler	 Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?
262	Kathy	 Yeah.
263	Chandler	 Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
264	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is debriefing Rachel on her rejection earlier that day and telling her what she should’ve done. Ross and Phoebe are watching.]
265	Joey	 Okay, for next time, what do you say?
266	Rachel	 I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
267	Ross	 So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
268	Rachel	 He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!
269	Monica	 (entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on.
270	Joey	 What’s ready?
271	Monica	 Just come.
272		(They all go over to her apartment.)
273	Ross	 Oh my God!
274	Rachel	 Wow! Monica!
275	Phoebe	 Great!
276	Ross	 This is beautiful!
277		(She has cleaned it, completely redecorated it, removed the carpet, and polished the floor.)
278	Phoebe	 Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
279	Monica	 Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
280	Joey	 I don’t know, it looks the same.
281	Monica	 You used to have carpet.
282	Joey	 Oh yeah!
283	Monica	 So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
284	Ross	 Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
285	Monica	 Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.
286		(Chandler returns.)
287	Ross	 Hey!
288	Joey	 How’d it go?
289	Chandler	 Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.
290	Phoebe	 Oh good!
291	Chandler	 She is now.
292	Ross	 What are you saying?
293	Chandler	 I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
294	Phoebe	 How? How is your fault?
295	Chandler	 Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
296	Rachel	 Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
297	Ross	 Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…
298		(They all turn and glare at him.)
299		Closing Credits
300	[Scene	 Bloomingdale’s, Rachel is sitting at her desk as Mr. Waltham comes in.]
301	Mr. Waltham	 Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
302	Rachel	 Really?
303	Mr. Waltham	 Will you call him?
304	Rachel	 Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?
