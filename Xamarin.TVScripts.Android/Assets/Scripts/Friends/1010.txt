6	[Scene	 Central Perk. Everybody's sitting on the couch and Monica is eating a chunk of cake.] Monica
7	Rachel	 My God, get a room!
8	Monica	 I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
9	Phoebe	 If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
10	Monica	 (with no hesitation) Sex!
11	Chandler	 (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!
12	Monica	 Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
13	Chandler	 (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
14	Phoebe	 Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
15	Ross	 Food.
16	Phoebe	 Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
17	Ross	 Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
18	Rachel	 Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
19	Joey	 Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
20	Rachel	 No, you gotta pick one!
21	Joey	 Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
22	OPENING CREDITS [Scene	 Central Perk. Rachel and Phoebe are looking at some photos and they're sitting next to the window.] Rachel
23	Phoebe	 Oh, how cute!
24	Rachel	 Yeah.
25	Phoebe	 Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
26	Rachel	 Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
27	Phoebe	 Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)
28	Rachel	 Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
29	Phoebe	 OH! He's having an affair.
30	Rachel	 He's not having an affair!
31	Phoebe	 You know, I'm always right about these things.
32	Rachel	 No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
33	Phoebe	 Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
34	Rachel	 Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
35	Phoebe	 Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
36	Chandler	 (picking up the phone) Hello.
37	Phoebe	 Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
38	Chandler	 Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
39	Phoebe	 (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
40	Chandler	 Those are all really old!
41	Phoebe	 Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
42	Rachel	 (whispering) "Dude, Where's My Car?"
43	Phoebe	 (glancing at her) What?
44	Rachel	 They're in a caaar...
45	Phoebe	 (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
46	Rachel	 Geez!
47	Phoebe	 Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
48	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
49	Phoebe	 (patting her bag) I got them!
50	[Scene	 Monica’s apartment. Chandler enters the door.] Chandler
51	Monica	 Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
52	Chandler	 I was in the car with Nancy all day.
53	Monica	 Nancy doesn’t smoke!
54	Chandler	 Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
55	Monica	 So? What do you think of the house?
56	Chandler	 It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
57	Monica	 Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
58	Chandler	 And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
59	Monica	 Don’t you love the huge yard?
60	Chandler	 And the fireplace in the bedroom.
61	Monica	 And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
62	Chandler	 This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
63	Monica	 So? Do you think we should get it?
64	Chandler	 I don’t know. What do you think?
65	Monica	 I think we should.
66	Chandler	 I do too.
67	Monica	 This is huge!
68	Chandler	 I know.
69	Monica	 How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
70	Chandler	 I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
71	Monica	 Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
72	Chandler	 We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
73	Monica	 Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
74	Chandler	 I know. Gooooood luck with it.
75	[Scene	 Joey’s apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.] Ross
76	Rachel	 I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
77	Joey	 Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
78	Ross	 I know, and with the baby coming?
79	Phoebe	 So, should we tell her?
80	Ross	 I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
81	Phoebe	 Why? Who’d you seen him with?
82	Ross	 No one, I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
83	Phoebe	 TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
84	Ross	 (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
85	Phoebe	 All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
86	Ross	 Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
87	Phoebe 	 WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
88	[Scene	 Monica’s apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.] Rachel
89	Monica	 If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
90	Joey	 Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
91	Monica	 No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
92	Phoebe	 Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
93	Monica (puzzled)	 All right...
94	Ross	 We think Chandler might be having an affair.
95	Monica	 What?
96	Rachel	 Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
97	Phoebe	 They went in together. So sorry.
98	Monica	 Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
99		(they all look confused and sorry for her)
100	Phoebe	 What?
101	Joey	 (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
102	Monica	 Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)
103	Chandler	 Hey!
104	Joey	 (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!
105	Chandler	 Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
106	Monica	 (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
107	Rachel	 Who's Nancy?
108	Ross	 What's going on?
109	Monica	 (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
110	Chandler	 Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
111	Joey	 I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
112	Phoebe	 Why do you have a realtor?
113	Monica	 Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
114	Joey	 (clearly shocked) What?
115	Rachel	 Are you serious?
116	Monica	 When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
117	Phoebe	 So you're gonna move?
118	Ross	 Oh my God.
119	Joey	 Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
120	Rachel	 What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
121	Monica	 And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
122	Chandler	 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
123	Ross	 (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
124	Phoebe	 Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
125	Ross	 You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
126	Joey	 No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)
127	Ross	 (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
128		(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)
129	Chandler	 Actually, we already found a house we love.
130	Ross	 What?
131	Monica	 And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
132		(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)
133	Chandler	 Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
134		TIME LAPSE
135	Ross	 You put an offer on a house?
136	Monica	 (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
137	Phoebe	 Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
138	Chandler	 I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
139	Joey	 Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!
140	Chandler	 (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
141	Monica	 We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?
142	Rachel	 Yeah it is.
143	Joey	 What the hell are you doin'?
144	Rachel	 Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was
145	Phoebe	 Yeah, but so is this.
146	Ross	 Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
147		[We fade to some flashback scenes.] (from 1.01 - "The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate - The Pilot")
148	Rachel	 (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
149	Ross	 You can see where he'd have trouble.
150	Rachel	 Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
151	Monica	 Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
152		(from 1.18 - "The One With All the Poker")
153	Ross	 That money is mine, Green!
154	Rachel	 You're fly is open, Geller!
155	Phoebe	 You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
156	Chandler	 Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
157		(from 1.07 - "The One With The Blackout")
158	Phoebe	 [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
159		[They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.]
160	Rachel	 Ow, that had to hurt!
161		(from 3.09 - "The One With All the Football")
162	Phoebe	 Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
163	The Guys	 We will. (they don’t move)
164	Monica	 Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
165	Rachel	 No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
166		(Rachel sticks a marshmallow into Monica’s nose. Monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)
167	Monica	 Every year.
168		(from 5.08 - "The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks")
169	Joey	 (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!
170	Phoebe	 (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
171	Joey	 I put it on to scare Chandler!
172	Phoebe	 Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
173	Joey	 It smells really bad in here.
174	Phoebe	 Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
175		(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck on Joey's head.)
176	Monica	 Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
177	Joey	 It's Joey.
178		(from 4.12 - "The one With the Embryos")
179	Monica	 I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
180	Rachel	 Oooohh that’s interesting.
181	Chandler	 If you win, we give up the birds.
182	Joey	 (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
183	Chandler	 But if we win, we get your apartment.
184	Joey	 Oooooh!
185	Monica	 Deal!
186	TIME LAPSE Ross	 What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
187	Joey	 Big fat goalie.
188	Ross	 Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
189	Chandler	 Dangerous Liaisons.
190	Ross	 Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
191	Joey	 Weekend at Bernie’s.
192	Ross	 Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
193		(They both confer)
194	Joey	 Everyday use.
195	Chandler	 Fancy.
196	Joey	 Guest.
197	Chandler	 Fancy guest.
198	Ross	 Two seconds...
199	Joey	 Uhh, 11!
200	Ross	 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)
201	Ross	 (to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
202	Rachel	 14?
203	Ross	 No, 19.
204	Chandler	 Thanks man.
205	Ross	 Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
206	Monica	 Maurice.
207	Ross	 Correct, his profession was?
208	Rachel	 Space cowboy!
209	Ross	 Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
210		(The girls are stumped)
211	Rachel	 Ow...Oh Gosh!
212	Ross	 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
213	Monica	 It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
214	Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce...transpondster!
215	Monica	 That’s not even a word!
216		(Ross stops the clock, signifying the end of the lightning round.)
217	Monica	 NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
218		TIME LAPSE (The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)
219	Rachel	 Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
220	Joey	 Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
221	Rachel	 That is not true. She did! She forced me!
222	Monica	 Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
223	Rachel	 Well it stupid, unfair question!
224	Ross	 Don’t blame the questions!
225	Chandler	 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
226		(from 5.15 - "The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey")
227	Ross	 Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
228	Chandler	 (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
229	Monica	 (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
230		(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)
231	Ross	 What the hell are doing?!!
232	Rachel	 (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!
233	Chandler	 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
234	Joey	 (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
235	Ross	 (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
236	Chandler	 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
237	Monica	 I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
238		(There's a brief pause.)
239	Ross	 (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
240		(from 6.06 - "The One On The Last Night")
241	Monica	 Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
242	Rachel	 Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
243	Phoebe	 Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
244	Monica and Rachel	 What?!
245	Phoebe	 You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
246	Rachel	 Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
247	Monica	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
248	Phoebe	 What else?
249	Monica	 When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
250	Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
251	Phoebe	 That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
252	Monica	 When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
253	Rachel	 Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
254	Monica	 And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
255		TIME LAPSE (Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel’s old and now empty room.)
256	Chandler	 (entering) Hey.
257	Monica	 She really left.
258	Chandler	 I know. (He kisses her.)
259	Monica	 Thank you.
260	Chandler	 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
261	Monica	 Can I ask you a question?
262	Chandler	 Sure!
263	Monica	 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
264		(from 1.09 - "The One Where Underdog Gets Away")
265	Chandler	 Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
266	All	 That's so sweet.
267	Ross	 And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
268	Rachel	 And a crappy New Year.
269	Chandler	 Here, here!
270	[Scene	 We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. They're all still at the kitchen table.] Rachel
271	Joey	 Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
272	Phoebe	 Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
273	Ross	 You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
274	Rachel	 Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
275		(The phone rings and Chandler goes to get it)
276	Chandler	 Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
277	Monica	 And?
278		(Chandler listens to what Nancy says)
279	Chandler	 (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
280	Monica	 We can't afford that.
281	Chandler	 I know.
282	Monica	 Well, there you go.
283		(Chandler and Monica hug)
284	Joey	 I'm really sorry you guys.
285	Ross	 Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
286	Rachel	 Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
287	Phoebe	 (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?
288	Monica	 Yeah, we'll be okay.
289	Ross	 Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
290	Joey	 You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
291	Chandler	 That's okay, we understand.
292	Joey	 And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
293		(Chandler gives Joey her business card, which he eagerly grabs and he leaves.)
294	Monica	 I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
295	Chandler	 Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
296	Monica	 What?
297	Chandler	 We got the house.
298	Monica	 Oh my God!
299	Chandler	 I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
300	Monica	 Oh my God! My God! We've got the house!?
301	Chandler	 We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
302	Monica	 And a baby...
303	Chandler	 We're growing up.
304	Monica	 We sure are.
305	Chandler	 So who's gonna tell them?
306	Monica	 (quickly) Not it!
307	Chandler	 Not it! Damn it!
308	COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene	 Central Perk. The entire gang is there, and Chandler and Monica are handing out presents.] Monica
309	Rachel	 Aah! Why? What are these for?
310	Chandler	 You'll see.
311	Monica	 All right, everybody open them!
312		(they all tear off the wrapping paper)
313	Rachel	 Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
314	Phoebe	 Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
315	Monica	 I know.
316	Ross	 I love this. (he got a sweater)
317	Joey	 A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
318	Ross	 Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
319	Chandler	 Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
320	Monica	 Enjoy!
321		(they both run off, leaving Ross, Phoebe and Rachel stunned.)
322	Joey	 (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?
323		THE END
