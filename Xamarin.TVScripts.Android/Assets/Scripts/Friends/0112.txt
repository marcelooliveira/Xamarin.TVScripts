4		Opening Credits
5	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone in the kitchen.]
6	Monica	 Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
7		(Camera moves to Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Joey sitting in living room)
8	Joey	 Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
9	Ross	 Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
10	Phoebe	 Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)
11	Chandler	 And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
12	Phoebe	 (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)
13	Monica	 Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
14		(Camera pans back to group in living room)
15	Joey	 Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!
16	Ross	 (waves) Hello!
17	Joey	 (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause; shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)
18		(Rachel enters with Paolo, speaking Italian. Ross looks annoyed)
19	Rachel	 Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
20	Paolo	 Ah, poke (Paolo touches Rachel's nose) a (touches nose again) nose, mmm (they rub noses, then kisses her)
21	Joey, Chandler, and Ross	 (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo) Mma, Mma, Mmaah
22		(Camera pans to Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe in the kitchen)
23	Monica	 So, did I hear Poconos?
24	Rachel	 Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
25	Phoebe	 Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
26	Monica	 Yeah, that's a big step.
27	Rachel	 I know...
28		(Camera pans to Ross, looking dejected)
29	Chandler	 (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
30	Ross	 Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
31		(Camera pans back to Rachel)
32	Rachel	 I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
33		(Camera pans to Ross, holding his stomach)
34	Ross	 ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
35	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler and Joey leaving girls' apartment, carrying lasagna.]
36	Joey	 I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
37	Chandler	 Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
38		(Joey opens door, throws keys on kitchen table, table falls over)
39	Joey	 Need a new table.
40	Chandler	 You think?
41	[Scene	 Carol and Susan's, there's a knock on the door and Carol answers it to Ross.]
42	Carol	 Hey hey, come on in!
43		(Ross enters, carrying lasagna)
44	Ross	 Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
45	Carol	 Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
46	Ross	 (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
47	Carol	 So, I got the results of the amnio today.
48	Ross	 (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
49	Carol	 Totally and completely healthy!
50	Ross	 Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame)
51	Ross	 Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
52	Carol	 Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
53	Ross	 (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)
54	Carol	 Don't you want to know about the sex?
55	Ross	 (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...
56	Carol	 The sex of the baby, Ross.
57	Ross	 Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
58	Carol	 Do you want to know?
59	Ross	 No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...
60		(Susan enters)
61	Susan	 Oh, hello Ross!
62	Ross	 Susan...
63	Susan	 So, so, did you hear?
64	Ross	 Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
65	Susan	 Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It really is...do we know...?
66	Carol	 Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
67	Ross	 (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
68	Susan	 Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
69	Carol	 Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and lightly taps Susan's shoulder)
70	Ross	 Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
71	Carol and Susan	 It's a...
72	Ross	 (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
73	Carol	 Well, thanks for the books.
74	Ross	 No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
75	Susan	 All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? (intercom buzzer rings)
76	Carol	 Hello?
77	Ross	 (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and Susan laugh)
78	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler use their knees as a table to support the lasagna.]
79	Chandler	 Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
80	Joey	 That's the rule.
81	Chandler	 What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
82	Joey	 How'd you get to that?
83	Chandler	 Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
84	Joey	 You knew about that?
85	Chandler	 Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
86	Joey	 Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
87	Chandler	 What do you mean, like, buy it together?
88	Joey	 Yeah
89	Chandler	 You think we're ready for something like that?
90	Joey	 Why not?
91	Chandler	 Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
92	Joey	 Why, are you moving out?
93	Chandler	 I'm not moving out.
94	Joey	 You'd tell me if you were moving out right
95	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
96	Joey	 Aw, I know all about Kip!
97	Chandler	 It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
98	Joey	 Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
99	Chandler	 Aw, don't do that
100	[Scene	 Phoebe's Massage Parlor, Phoebe's assistant is telling her about the changes to her schedule.]
101	Phoebe's Assistant	 We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4
102	Phoebe	 Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
103	Phoebe's Assistant	 Oh, here comes your 3
104	Paolo	 Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
105	Phoebe	 Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
106	Paolo	 Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
107	Phoebe	 Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
108		(Paolo speaks Italian)
109	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
110	Paolo	 Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
111	Phoebe	 Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
112	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]
113	Rachel	 (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
114	Monica	 And Monica knows...
115	Ross	 Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
116	Monica	 Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
117	Joey	 So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)
118	Ross	 Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
119	Monica	 I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
120	Joey	 Or an uncle...
121		(Phoebe enters)
122	Joey and Chandler	 Hey Phoebe!
123	Ross	 Hi Pheebs!
124	Rachel	 Pheebs!
125	Phoebe	 Fine!
126	Monica	 Phoebe, what's the matter?
127	Phoebe	 Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
128	Customer	 Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
129	Rachel	 Oh, right, that's me!
130	Joey	 Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
131	Chandler	 Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
132	Monica	 Phoebe, what is it?
133	Phoebe	 All right, you know Paolo?
134	Ross	 I'm familiar with his work, yes...
135	Phoebe	 Well, he made a move on me.
136		(Joey and Chandler come back)
137	Joey	 Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
138	Chandler	 More coffee over here, please!
139		Commercial Break
140	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
141	Monica	 Well, what happened?
142	Phoebe	 Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)
143		[Cut back to Central Perk.]
144	Joey and Chandler	 Ooooohh!
145	Ross	 My God.
146	Monica	 Are you sure?
147		(The flashback resumes with Paolo grabbing her butt.)
148		[Cut back to Central Perk.]
149	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues
150	Monica	 Was it...?
151	Phoebe	 Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
152	Guys	 Oooooo....
153		(Rachel runs over)
154	Rachel	 "Ooo," what?
155	Phoebe	 Uma Thurman.
156	Monica	 Oh!
157	Ross	 The actress!
158		(all talking indistinctly, high-fiving)
159	Ross	 Thanks Rach.
160		(Rachel walks away)
161	Chandler	 So what are you gonna do?
162	Ross	 You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)
163	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
164	Joey	 Feminist issue. That's where I went!
165	Phoebe	 She is gonna hate me.
166	Ross	(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...
167	[Scene	 The Table Store, Joey and Chandler and looking for their new table.]
168	Joey	 Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)
169	Chandler	 That's patio furniture!
170	Joey	 So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
171	Chandler	 (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
172	Joey	 I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
173	Chandler	 You pick one.
174	Joey	 All right, how about the ladybugs?
175	Chandler	 Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
176	Joey	 Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
177	Chandler	 Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
178	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel folding and packing clothes in suitcases as Phoebe enters.]
179	Phoebe	 Hey!
180	Rachel	 Hi Pheebs!
181	Phoebe	 Are you moving out?
182	Rachel	 No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.
183	Phoebe	 Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
184	Rachel	 Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
185	Phoebe	 Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,
186	Rachel	 Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
187	Phoebe	 Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)
188	Rachel	 (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
189	Phoebe	 Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
190	Rachel	 All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
191	Phoebe	 Which proves that I never lie.
192	Rachel	 I guess you don't.
193	Phoebe	 Paolo made a pass at me.
194		(Rachel looks stunned)
195	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Chandler, Joey, and Monica admiring their new table.]
196	Chandler	 So, what do you think?
197	Ross	 I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
198	Chandler	 I know!
199		(The camera pans back to reveal Joey and Chandler's new foosball table.)
200	Monica	 So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
201	Joey	 Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
202	Monica	 Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
203		(Chandler looks at Joey in amazement)
204	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is recovering from the shock.]
205	Phoebe	 Are you okay?
206	Rachel	 I need some milk.
207	Phoebe	 Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
208	Rachel	 No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
209	Phoebe	 I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
210		(Phoebe's and Rachel's lines overlap)
211	Rachel	 Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
212	Rachel and Phoebe	 I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
213	Phoebe	 No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
214	Rachel	 I don't know...right, he's the pig!
215	Phoebe	 Such a pig!
216	Rachel	 Oh, God, he's such a pig,
217	Phoebe	 Oh he's like a...
218	Rachel	 He's like a big disgusting...
219	Phoebe	 ...like a...
220	Rachel	 ...pig...pig man!
221	Phoebe	 Yes, good! Ok...
222	Rachel	 (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
223	Phoebe	 (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
224	Rachel	 Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
225	Phoebe	 The end.
226	Rachel	 Oh, God...
227	Phoebe	 Should I not have told you?
228	Rachel	 No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
229		(Phoebe scoots her chair over to Rachel and hugs her)
230	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling everyone how it went across the hall as the foosball game continues.]
231	Phoebe	 I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
232	Monica	 We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
233	Ross	 (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
234	Joey	 No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
235	Ross	 Come on, two on one.
236	Chandler	 What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
237	Ross	 What, now?
238	Joey	 Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
239	Chandler	 My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
240	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is throwing Paolo's clothes over the side.]
241	Paolo	 No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
242		[Cut to inside the apartment.]
243	Ross	 (entering) How's it going?
244	Monica	 Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
245	Phoebe	 Ooh!
246		(Paolo enters. Ross, Phoebe, and Monica scatter)
247	Paolo	 Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
248	Phoebe	 Oh, ok bye-bye.
249	Monica	 Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
250	Paolo	 Grazie.
251	Ross	 Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
252	Phoebe	 Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)
253	Ross	 Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
254	Monica	 Oh, you're right.
255	Ross	 (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
256		[Cut to the balcony, Ross has just climbed through the window.]
257	Ross	 Hey.
258	Rachel	 Hey.
259	Ross	 You all right?
260	Rachel	 Ooh, I've been better...
261	Ross	 Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
262	Rachel	 Oh, Ross...
263	Ross	 What?
264	Rachel	 I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)
265	Ross	 Huh.
266	Rachel	 Oh Ross, you're so great!
267	Ross	 Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
268		[Cut to inside the apartment, Rachel and Ross are entering.]
269	Monica	 Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
270	Rachel	 Oh...
271	Phoebe	 You ok?
272	Rachel	 ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
273	Phoebe	 Yep!
274	Ross	 See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
275	Rachel	 No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
276	Ross	 Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
277	Rachel	 No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
278	Ross	 (astonished) What?
279	Rachel	 What?
280	Ross	 I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
281	Rachel	 Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
282	Ross	 Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
283	Girls	 Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)
284	Ross	 I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
285		(Joey and Chandler run in)
286	Chandler	 Wha-
287	Joey	 Wha-
288	Joey and Chandler	 What is it?
289	Ross	 I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
290	Joey	 Hey!
291	Chandler	 Hey!
292	Joey and Chandler	 We already knew that! (they hug)
293	Ross	 I'm having a son. Um...
294		(Ross looks scared)
295		Closing Credits
296	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Monica is busy killing Chandle and Joey at foosball.]
297	Monica	 Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
298	Joey and Chandler	 Shut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms.)
299	Monica	 Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
300	Joey	 Uh, it's 2
301	Chandler	 Yeah, get out!
302	Monica	 You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
303	Chandler	 (to Joey) One more game?
304	Joey	 Oh yeah!
