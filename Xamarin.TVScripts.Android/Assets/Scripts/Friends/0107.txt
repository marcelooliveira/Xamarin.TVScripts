2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is introducing Phoebe, who is playing her guitar for the crowd.]
3	Rachel	 Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
4		(applause)
5	Phoebe	 Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much.
6	[Scene	 The ATM vestibule of a bank, Chandler is inside. The lights go out, and he realizes he is trapped inside.]
7	Chandler	 Oh, great. This is just...
8		(Chandler sees that there is a gorgeous model inside the vestibule with him. He makes a gesture of quiet exuberance.)
9	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone with her mother. Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross are there.]
10	Rachel	 Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
11	Monica	 Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
12	Rachel	 Wow, you guys, this is big.
13	Monica	 (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)
14	Phoebe	 Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
15		(Monica and Rachel look at Phoebe strangely.)
16	Phoebe	 Well, I never call me.
17	[Scene	 ATM vestibule, Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone. Chandler's thoughts are in italics.]
18	Chandler	 Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
19	Jill	 (on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.
20	Chandler	 She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
21	Jill	 (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
22	Chandler	 Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
23	Jill	 (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
24	Chandler	 Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
25		(Chandler strides proudly across the vestibule and Jill stares at him.)
26	[Scene	 Monica's apartment, Joey enters with a menorah, the candles lit.]
27	Joey	 Hi everyone.
28	Ross	 And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
29	Joey	 Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
30	Phoebe	 (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
31		(They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.)
32	Rachel	 That had to hurt!
33	[Scene	 ATM vestibule.]
34	Chandler	 Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
35		(Chandler smiles at her, she smiles back sweetly.)
36	Chandler	 There you go!
37		(He continues to smile like an idiot, and she looks frightened.)
38	Chandler	 You're definitely scaring here.
39	Jill	 (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)
40	Chandler	 Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
41	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, The phone rings; it's Chandler.]
42	Monica	 Hello?
43	Chandler	 Hey, it's me.
44	Monica	 (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
45	Chandler	 Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
46	Monica	 What?
47	Chandler	 I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
48	Monica	 I have no idea what you just said.
49	Chandler	 (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
50	Joey	 What's up man?
51	Chandler	 I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
52	Joey	 (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
53	Chandler	 Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
54	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, time has passed. The five are sitting around the coffee table talking.]
55	Rachel	 Alright, somebody.
56	Monica	 OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
57	All	 Whoooaa!
58	Ross	 That's my sister.
59	Joey	 OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
60	Monica	 Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
61	Ross	 Pheebs, what about you?
62	Phoebe	 Oh... Milwaukee.
63	Rachel	 Um... Ross?
64	Ross	 Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
65	All	 No way!
66	Ross	 The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
67	Phoebe	 Oh, Rachel.
68	Rachel	 Oh come on, I already went.
69	Monica	 You did not go!
70	All	 Come on.
71	Rachel	 Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed.
72	Ross	 Step back.
73	Joey	 We have a winner!
74		[Time lapse, Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe are out of the room.]
75	Rachel	 I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
76	Ross	 Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
77	Rachel	 There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
78	Ross	 Come on.
79	Rachel	 No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
80	Ross	 (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
81	Rachel	 I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
82	Ross	 Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
83	Rachel	 Yeah right.
84	Ross	 It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
85	Rachel	 (sigh) OK.
86	Ross	 But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
87	Rachel	 You don't.
88	Ross	 Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
89	Rachel	 Really?
90	Ross	 Mmmm.
91	Rachel	 You do?
92	Ross	 I do.
93	Rachel	 Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
94		(Ross gets up, pleased with himself.)
95	Joey	 It's never gonna happen.
96	Ross	 (innocently) What?
97	Joey	 You and Rachel.
98	Ross	 (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
99	Joey	 Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
100	Ross	 No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
101	Joey	 Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
102	Ross	 I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
103	Joey	 Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
104	Ross	 I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?
105	Joey	 Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)
106	Ross	 Shhhh!
107	Rachel	 What are you shushing?
108	Ross	 We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
109	Rachel	 Ahhhh!
110	Ross	 See?
111	Rachel	 Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
112	[Scene	 ATM vestibule.]
113	Jill	 Would you like some gum?
114	Chandler	 Um, is it sugarless?
115	Jill	 (checks) Sorry, it's not.
116	Chandler	 Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note
117	[Scene	 Monica's apartment, Phoebe is singing.]
118	Phoebe	 (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)
119	Ross	 (to Joey) OK, here goes.
120	Joey	 Are you going to do it?
121	Ross	 I'm going to do it.
122	Joey	 Do you want any help?
123	Ross	 You come out there, you're a dead man.
124	Joey	 Good luck, man.
125	Ross	 Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
126	Joey	 OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
127		(Monica walks in, starts to go out on the balcony.)
128	Joey	 Hey, where are you going?
129	Monica	 Outside.
130	Joey	 You can't go out there.
131	Monica	 Why not?
132	Joey	 Because of... the reason.
133	Monica	 And that would be?
134	Joey	 I, um, can't tell you.
135	Monica	 Joey, what's going on?
136	Joey	 OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
137	Monica	 About what?
138	Joey	 He's planning your birthday party.
139	Monica	 Oh my God! I love him!
140	Joey	 (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
141	Phoebe	 About what?
142	Monica	 My surprise party!
143	Phoebe	 What surprise party?
144	Monica	 Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
145	Phoebe	 Well, he didn't tell me.
146	Joey	 Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
147	Phoebe	 This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
148	Monica	 No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
149	Phoebe	 Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.
150	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Ross and Rachel are talking.]
151	Rachel	 Hmmm... this is so nice.
152	Ross	 OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
153	Rachel	 OK.
154	Ross	 OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
155	Rachel	 Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
156	Ross	 Yes, yes, that's right...
157	Rachel	 Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
158	Ross	 What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
159		[Cut to inside. Monica, Joey and Phoebe are singing while outside, Ross and Rachel are trying to get the cat off of Ross' shoulder.]
160	Monica, Joey, and Phoebe	 (singing) I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
161	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the scratches on Ross' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound.]
162	Monica	 (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
163		(Ross flinches in pain.)
164	Joey	 Sorry, that was wax.
165	Phoebe	 Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
166	Ross	 Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
167	Rachel	 During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
168	Ross	 (nonchalantly) Yeah?
169	[Scene	 ATM vestibule.]
170	Chandler	 You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
171	[Scene	 The hallway of Monica's building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the cat's owner.]
172	Phoebe	 (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
173	Rachel	 Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
174	Mr. Heckles	 Er, yeah, it's mine.
175	Phoebe	 (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
176	Mr. Heckles	 Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
177	Phoebe	 Wait a minute. What's his name?
178	Mr. Heckles	 Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
179	Rachel	 Bob Buttons?
180	Mr. Heckles	 Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
181	Phoebe	 (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
182	Mr. Heckles	 (as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.
183	[Scene	 Rachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat's owner.]
184	Rachel	 Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
185		(While looking at the floor for the cat, Rachel runs into a pair of legs. She slowly gets up and sees a gorgeous Italian hunk holding the cat. Who, by the way, you'll hate very, very soon. The man. Not the cat.)
186	Paolo	 (something Italian)
187	Rachel	 Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
188	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing Monopoly.]
189	Ross	 (rolling) Lucky sixes....
190	Rachel	 (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
191	Monica	 (smitten) Hi!
192	Rachel	 And Joey....
193	Monica	 Hi!
194	Rachel	 And Ross.
195	Monica	 Hi!
196	Paolo	 (something in Italian)
197	Rachel	 (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
198	Paolo	 (pointing at game) Monopoly!
199	Rachel	 Look at that!
200	Ross	 (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
201	Rachel	 Oh... Italy, I think.
202	Ross	 No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
203	Rachel	 Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
204	Ross	 That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
205		(Phoebe enters.)
206	Phoebe	 Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
207	Rachel	 Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
208	Phoebe	 Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
209	Rachel	 Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
210	Paolo	 (something in Italian, he is apparently attracted to Phoebe)
211	Phoebe	 (smiling) You betcha!
212	[Scene	 ATM vestibule.]
213	Chandler	 (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
214		(Chandler waits until Jill is looking, then starts to blow a bubble. But instead of blow one, he accidentally spits the gum out of his mouth and hits the wall.)
215	Chandler	 Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
216	Chandler	 Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
217		(Chandler starts to choke.)
218	Jill	 Are you alright?
219		(Chandler tries to save face and makes the 'OK' sign with his hands, while obviously unable to breathe.)
220	Jill	 My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better?
221	Chandler	 (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
222	Jill	 Perfection?
223	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Paolo are at the window. Ross and Joey are watching disgustedly.]
224	Paolo	 (something romantic in Italian about Rachel and the stars)
225	Ross	 (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
226		(Rachel walks away from Paolo, laughing.)
227	Ross	 Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
228	Rachel	 I have absolutely no idea.
229	Ross	 That's... that's classic.
230	Rachel	 (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
231	Monica	 If you want, I'll do it.
232		(Ross looks at Joey.)
233	Phoebe	 I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won't.
234	Rachel	 God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
235	Phoebe	 You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
236	Rachel	 Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
237		[Cut to the other side of the apartment, Ross has gone over to straighten things out with Paolo.]
238	Ross	 Paolo. Hi.
239	Paolo	 Ross!
240		(Ross notices that Paolo is standing on a step, which makes him taller. Ross gets up on the same step so he can look down at Paolo.)
241	Ross	 Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
242	Paolo	 Thing?
243	Ross	 Thing, yes. Thing.
244	Paolo	 Ah, you... have the sex?
245	Ross	 No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
246	Paolo	 Bed?
247	Ross	 No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
248	Paolo	 Oh!
249	Ross	 Yeah! Se vice?
250	Paolo	 Si.
251	Ross	 So you do know a little English.
252	Paolo	 Poco... a leetle.
253	Ross	 Do you know the word crapweasel?
254	Paolo	 No.
255	Ross	 That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
256		(They hug.)
257	[Scene	 ATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen around his head.]
258	Jill	 Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
259	Chandler	 OK.
260	Jill	 Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)
261		(Chandler tries to do the same thing but the pen hits him in the head.)
262	Jill	 No, you've got to whip it.
263		(He swings the pen hard, and it snaps back and almost hits him again.)
264	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all sitting around the table.]
265	Phoebe	 Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)
266	Ross	 Thank you.
267	Phoebe	 Thanks.
268	Ross	 Kinda... spooky without any lights.
269	Joey	 (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
270		(Everyone starts to imitate him.)
271	Ross	 OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
272		(The lights come back on, and Rachel and Paolo are making out. Ross clutches his chest.)
273	Ross	 Oh.. oh... oh.
274	Joey	 Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
275	[Scene	 ATM vestibule, the power has come back on.]
276	Jill	 Well, this has been fun.
277	Chandler	 Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
278	Jill	 Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya.
279		(She leaves. Chandler presses his face to the glass door after her, stroking the window lovingly. He then turns to the security camera and starts talking to it.)
280	Chandler	 Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
281		End
