3	Chandler	 Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
4	Joey	 How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
5	Chandler	 You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
6	Joey	 Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
7	Chandler	 All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.
8	Joey	 All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)
9	Chandler	 (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!

22	Ross	 (to Rachel) I was just leaving.
23	Rachel	 Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.
24	Ross	 Why? Did you write it?
25	Rachel	 (sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
26	Ross	 Well ah, actually...
27	Rachel	 (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
28	Ross	 Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?
29	Rachel	 Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?
30	Ross	 Oh, I’m sure.
31	Rachel	 (on phone) Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.

33	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is finishing up a song.]
34	Phoebe	 (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you, thanks.
35	Ross	 (reading the newspaper) Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
36	Chandler	 Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
37	Ross	 I’m reading your ad.
38	Joey	 Looks good, uh?
39	Ross	 Yeah.
40	Chandler	 (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
41	Phoebe	 Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
42	Rachel	 Why? I love that thing.
43	Chandler	 You want it?
44	Phoebe and Rachel	 Oh no.
45	Chandler	 Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
46	Joey	 Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
47	Chandler	 All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
48	Joey	 What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
49	Chandler	 (looks at him) Nooo.
50	Joey	 Oh. What do you do?
51	Chandler	 I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!
52	Phoebe	 Yeah, I actually don’t know...
53	Ross	 Good, so do I
54	Rachel	 Something to do with numbers?
55		[Cut to someone entering Central Perk which lets a cat in. The cat then runs over to Phoebe’s guitar case and starts sniffing around.]
56	Phoebe	 Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God.
57	Rachel	 What?
58	Phoebe	 Nothing. Nothing.
59	Joey	 What? What’s wrong?
60	Phoebe	 I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
61	Rachel	 You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
62	Phoebe	 No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
63	Ross	 Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
64	Phoebe	 No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!
65	Joey	 (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...
66	Chandler	 (interrupting) Let it go!!
67	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is working as Monica enters.]
68	Monica	 Hey!
69	Rachel	 Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?
70	Monica	 Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
71	Rachel	 Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!
72	Monica	 What, that little thing at the prom?
73	Rachel	 Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
74	Monica	 Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
75	Rachel	 I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
76	Monica	 Look, you and I went to different high schools...
77	Rachel	 Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.
78	Monica	 You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
79	Rachel	 (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
80	Monica	 It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
81	Rachel	 (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
82	Monica	 Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
83	Rachel	 Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
84	Monica	 Oh, really?!
85	Rachel	 Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
86	Monica	 I’ll try.
87	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, they are all there eating breakfast.]
88	Ross	 So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
89	Joey	 Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.
90	Chandler	 Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
91	Phoebe	 (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
92	Ross	 So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
93	Phoebe	 Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
94	Monica	 Why can’t you use the phone in here?
95	Phoebe	 Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)
96	Ross	 So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
97	Monica	 Ross, don’t start.
98	Ross	 Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!
99	Rachel	 I believe it.
100	Ross	 No you don’t.
101	Rachel	 Yes, I do.
102	Ross	 No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.
103	Rachel	 Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
104	Ross	 I do not always have to be—okay, okay. (starts to leave)
105	Rachel	 Jurassic Park could happen.
106		(Ross wants to say something, but just smiles and leaves.)
107	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are showing a couple of guys (Tony and Peter) the entertainment center.]
108	Tony	 Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!
109	Joey	 Pretty nice?
110	Chandler	 You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
111	Tony	 We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe.
112		(Joey jumps up in excitement and without turning around Chandler holds out his hand stopping him, and ushering him back into his seat. Joey sits down, dejected.)
113	Chandler	 Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.
114	Tony	 You gotta take the canoe!
115	Chandler	 All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
116	Peter	 We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as Tony chases after him)
117	Joey	 (to Peter) Good for you!!
118	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Ross are there.]
119	Rachel	 (entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
120	Ross	 (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
121	Rachel	 You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
122	Joey	 (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
123	Rachel	 Do we have to tell her?
124	Ross	 Yes, we have to tell her!
125	Monica	 Oh, but it’s made her so happy.
126	Ross	 (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
127	All	 (disappointed) Yeah.
128	Ross	 Thank you.
129	Rachel	 I hate when Ross is right!
130	Monica	 He is right, isn’t he?
131	Chandler	 Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.
132	All	 You think?
133	Chandler	 Oh-no, he’s right.
134		Commercial Break
135	[Scene	 Central Perk, the same scene is continued from before the break. With Joey, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler sitting on the couch.]
136	Phoebe	 (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)
137	Monica	 Hi!
138	All	 Hey!
139	Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
140	Phoebe	 Yeah?
141	Joey	 (pause) How’s that going?
142	Phoebe	 So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
143	Joey	 That’s so sweet. (pause) I’m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)
144	Monica	 (sliding into Joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)
145		(Rachel and Chandler slide into position.)
146	Rachel	 Pheebs...
147	Phoebe	 I just feel so, uhh.....
148	Rachel	 All right!!
149	Chandler	 I’m coming already!!
150	Rachel	 Jeez!
151		(They both get up and leave Phoebe alone.)
152	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading at the kitchen table as there is a knock on the door.]
153	Monica	 (running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)
154	Rachel	 Hello, Chip.
155	Chip	 Hey, Rach! How ya doin’?
156	Rachel	 I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.
157	Chip	 So ah, Monica ready yet?
158	Rachel	 She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?
159	Chip	 Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
160	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is showing off the entertainment center.]
161	Joey	 This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
162	Guy	 What?!
163	Joey	 Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
164	Guy	 No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.
165	Joey	 Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
166	Guy	 All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)
167	Joey	 Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya!
168		(The guys takes a hockey stick and slips it through the handles then proceeds to take the stereo and Chandler’s computer and walk out.)
169	Joey	 Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
170	[Scene	 A street, Chip is walking Monica to his motorcycle.]
171	Chip	 Here, we are.
172	Monica	 Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
173	Chip	 The what?
174	Monica	 That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.
175	Chip	 No, I think it’s cute. (kisses her)
176	Monica	 Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
177	Chip	 So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
178	Monica	 Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?
179	Chip	 Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
180	Monica	 Is that all?
181	Chip	 Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
182	Monica	 Ohh, how is he?
183	Chip	 Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
184	Monica	 Isn’t he an architect now?
185	Chip	 Yeah, they still wear underwear.
186	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is coming home. As we walks through the door, and without looking up, he goes to throw his keys on the foosball table, only, it’s gone and the keys it the floor. He then looks up at an empty apartment; everything is gone except for the entertainment center and that ceramic dog. Even the food in the fridge!]
187	Chandler	 OH MY GOD!!!
188	Joey	 (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!!
189	Chandler	 Are you all right?!
190	Joey	 Yeah...
191	Chandler	 (lets him out) What happened?!!
192	Joey	 (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
193	Chandler	 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
194	Joey	 Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
195	Chandler	 So—You got in voluntarily?!
196	Joey	 I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?
197	Chandler	 BEND OVER?!!!
198	[Scene	 Dot’s Spot, Chip and Monica are on there date, eating dinner. Chip is telling a story.]
199	Chip	 ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)
200	Monica	 Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?
201	Chip	 You know where I work!
202	Monica	 I do?
203	Chip	 The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
204	Monica	 You still work at the multiplex?
205	Chip	 Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
206	Monica	 Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?
207	Chip	 Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
208		(Monica takes a big swig of her martini.)
209	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Rachel, Phoebe, and Julio are consoling Joey and Chandler.]
210	Rachel	 Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
211	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
212	Joey	 (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
213	Monica	 (entering) Oh my God! What happened?
214	Chandler	 Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
215	Rachel	 (to Monica) So, how was your date?
216	Monica	 Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
217	Rachel	 Um-hmm.
218	Monica	 Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
219	Rachel	 Oh honey, I’m sorry.
220	Monica	 No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
221	Rachel	 Ohh! That’s so great!
222	Monica	 I know!
223	Ross	 (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
224	Chandler	 Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”
225	Ross	 (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?
226	Phoebe	 Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
227	Ross	 Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
228	Rachel	 I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)
229	Monica	 Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
230	Phoebe	 Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
231	Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel	 That’s a good call. Right.
232	Ross	 No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
233	Phoebe	 (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?
234	Ross	 None.
235	Phoebe	 Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
236	Ross	 I’m sorry.
237	Phoebe	 Okay.
238	Ross	 I don’t know what to say.
239	Rachel	 You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.
240	Phoebe	 I think she would like that.
241	Ross	 (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.
242	Phoebe	 Thank you. We both forgive you.
243	Rachel	 So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
244	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.
245	Chandler	 Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)
246	Phoebe	 Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.
247	Rachel	 I’ll go with you.
248	Monica	 Me too. (they all leave)
249	Ross	 Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.
250	Joey	 Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!
