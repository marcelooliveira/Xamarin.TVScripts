3	Chandler	 Hey! Ready to go?
4	Ross	 Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
5	Joey	 Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!
6	Chandler	 What are you doin'?
7	Ross	 Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
8	Chandler	 Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
9	Ross	 It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
10	Chandler	 The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
11	Ross	 Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
12	Chandler	 Bet she'd sleep with you now...
13	Ross	 No... I already e-mailed her.
14	Chandler	 Let me see what you wrote about yourself
15	Ross	 You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
16	Joey	 Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
17	Ross	 (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
18	Chandler	 Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
19	Joey	 (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
20	Ross	 (he comes back) Alright, let's go!
21	Joey	 Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
22	Ross	 I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
23	Joey	 (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
24		Opening credits
25	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment]
26	Rachel	 Hey! How was basketball?
27	Joey	 Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
28	Rachel	 Oh, no! Who did that?
29	Joey	 Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
30	Rachel	 She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
31	Joey	 (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
32	Rachel	 Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
33	Joey	 Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
34	Rachel	 All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
35	Joey	 Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
36	[Scene	 Central Perk]
37	Phoebe	 Hi.
38	Monica	 Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
39	Phoebe	 Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
40	Chandler	 Oh, I'm so sorry!
41	Phoebe	 Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
42	Chandler	 You're not gonna need my help?
43	Phoebe	 Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
44	Chandler	 Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
45	Phoebe	 Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
46	Monica	 Ok, you got it!
47	Phoebe	 (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
48	Monica	 Really? If that's what you want...
49	Phoebe	 That was a test and you just failed.
50	Monica	 Damn it! Rookie mistake!
51		(Ross enters and he's really angry. He goes towards Chandler who's sitting at the counter)
52	Ross	 (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
53	Chandler	 I believe I read that somewhere!
54	Ross	 That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) It's not funny!!
55	Chandler	 I respectfully disagree.
56	Ross	 I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
57	Chandler	 Who cares? Nobody reads those things
58	Ross	 You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
59	Chandler	 I don't have a page.
60	Ross	 Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
61	[Scene	 Rachel's room. Rachel and Emma are sleeping; Joey sneaks in and approaches the crib]
62	Joey	 Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)
63	Rachel	 (threatening Joey with a scrunchy)
64	Joey	 It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
65	Rachel	 What are you doing?
66	Joey	 Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
67	Rachel	 Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
68	Joey	 (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over.
69	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is looking at the screen of his laptop, shaking his head.]
70	Monica	 Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?
71	Chandler	 Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
72	Monica	 But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
73	Chandler	 Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
74	Monica	 (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
75	Chandler	 Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
76	Monica	 What are you doing?
77	Chandler	 Oh, you'll see my friend.
78		[Time lapse, still Chandler and Monica's, but only Chandler is there. Enter Ross]
79	Ross	 (visibly upset) I'm dead?
80	Chandler	 (faking sympathy) And so young.
81	Ross	 Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
82	Chandler	 Well, how you died was funny.
83	Ross	 Oh please, hit by a blimp?
84	Chandler	 It kills over one americans every year.
85	Ross	 Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
86	Chandler	 You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
87	Ross	 You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
88	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment]
89	Phoebe	 God, I wish Mike were here.
90	Monica	 Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
91		(Phoebe gives her a meaningful look)
92	Monica	 What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
93	Phoebe	 I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
94	Monica	 Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.
95	Phoebe	 Here.
96	Monica	 And now your cell.
97	Phoebe	 Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
98	Monica	 This is your cellphone?
99	Phoebe	 Yes.
100	Monica	 This is your current cellphone?
101	Phoebe	 Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
102	Monica	 Phoebe, where's your purse?
103		(They run for Phoebe's purse, Phoebe gets there first and takes the cell. Monica tries to take it away from her)
104	Monica	 No, no! Give it to me!
105	Phoebe	 You can't have it.
106	Monica	 Give it to me!
107	Phoebe	 No (tucks it in her pants)
108	Monica	 I'll go in there.
109	Phoebe	 (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
110	Monica	 Phoebe come here
111		(they fight a little, the phone falls and Monica picks it up)
112	Monica	 Haha!
113	Phoebe	 Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
114	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's. Enter Joey]
115	Joey	 Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
116	Rachel	 Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
117	Joey	 No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
118	Rachel	 Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
119	Joey	 No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
120	Rachel	 Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
121	Joey	 Make the transfer! (She does so)
122	Rachel	 Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
123	Joey	 Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
124		(Emma cries)
125	Rachel	 Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
126	Joey	 But he's the same.
127	Rachel	 Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
128	Joey	 But he's the same.
129	Rachel	 Joey, come on!
130	Joey	 He's the same!
131		(they exchange Hugsy's).
132	Joey	 (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
133	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. Enter Monica]
134	Monica	 Haha!
135	Phoebe	 You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
136	Monica	 So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
137	Phoebe	 Those are my shoes.
138	Monica	 Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
139	Phoebe	 Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
140		(Someone knocks on the door)
141	Monica	 Who's that? (goes to open door)
142	Phoebe	 I ordered Chinese food.
143		(Monica opens the door and Mike is standing at the doorway)
144	Phoebe	 What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
145	Monica	 (To Mike) What are you doing here?
146	Mike	 Phoebe called me.
147	Monica	 Phoebe!
148	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
149	Monica	 Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
150	Phoebe	 There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
151	Monica	 Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
152	Mike	 Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
153	Monica	 (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
154	Mike	 Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
155	Monica	 Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
156	Phoebe	 Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
157	Monica	 Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).
158	Phoebe	 Sit down.
159		(Phoebe and Mike sit next to each other)
160	Monica	 Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
161	Mike	 (to Phoebe) So how've you been?
162	Monica	 I've been pretty good!
163	Mike	 (to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.
164	Phoebe	 Thanks, you look good too.
165	Monica	 Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
166	Phoebe	 So how's the piano playing going?
167	Mike	 Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
168	Phoebe	 I've missed you too.
169		(Silence)
170	Monica	 You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
171	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment
172	Chandler	 Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
173	Ross	 uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
174	Chandler	 Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
175	Ross	 Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
176	Chandler	 No, come on, you know that's not true.
177	Ross	 What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
178	Chandler	 Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
179	Ross	 I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
180	Chandler	 Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
181	Ross	 You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
182	Chandler	 Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
183	Ross	 Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
184	Chandler	 Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
185	Ross	 No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
186	Chandler	 Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
187	Ross	 oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
188	[Scene	 Joey's room
189	Rachel	 I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
190	Joey	 Original or crappy?
191	Rachel	 Original.
192	Joey	 No, sorry haven't seen him.
193	Rachel	 Then what's that big lump under your covers?
194	Joey	 It's Monica, ok?
195	Rachel	 That's not Monica!
196	Joey	 Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
197	Rachel	 (to herself) Oh God.
198	Joey	 ... she's being unreasonable!
199	Rachel	 (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
200	Joey	 It does?
201	Rachel	 Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
202	Joey	 Really? She... she loves me?
203	Rachel	 Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).
204	Joey	 Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
205	Rachel	 Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!
206	Joey	 Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
207	Rachel	 Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
208	Joey	 How do you think I got him in the first place?
209	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment
210		(Monica is getting up from the couch)
211	Monica	 Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss
212	Mike	 I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
213	Phoebe	 I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
214	Mike	 It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
215	Monica	 (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!
216	Phoebe	 What?
217	Monica	 Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
218	Phoebe	 Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
219	Strange man	 (he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!
220	Mike	 Oh, crap!
221	Phoebe	 Who is this?
222	Mike	 My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
223	Monica	 Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
224	Manny	 Well, you are not doing a very good job!
225	Monica	 Excuse me?
226	Manny	 What's with the kissing?
227	Monica	 Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
228	Manny	 Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
229	Monica	 You didn't hear the speech!
230	Manny	 I've heard the speech
231	Monica	 Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
232	Manny	 You're weak!
233	Monica	 You're... weird!
234	Manny	 Your pants are undone!
235	Monica	 Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
236	Manny	 (looking at the sofa) Where did they go?
237	Monica	 Damn it!
238	Manny	 Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
239	Monica	 And I blame you too.
240	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment]
241	Ross	 It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
242		(someone knocks on the door)
243	Chandler	 There you go! Someone came!
244	Ross	 Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
245		(Chandler and Monica go open the door)
246	Monica	 Hi, glad you could come.
247	Chandler	 (in a mournful voice) Please, come in.
248	Tom	 Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
249	Chandler	 Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
250	Tom	 Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
251	Chandler	 At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
252	Ross	 Who is he?
253	Chandler	 Some guy, Tom Gordon.
254	Ross	 I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
255	Monica	 So, did you know Ross well?
256	Tom	 Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
257	Monica	 (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.
258	Tom	 What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
259	Chandler	 (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
260	Tom	 (before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me.
261	Chandler	 Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
262	Ross	 (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
263	Monica	 I look like a man??
264	Chandler	 Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
265	Ross	 It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
266	Chandler	 You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
267	Ross	 Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
268	Chandler	 Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
269	Ross	 (sceptical) Yeah...
270		(someone knocks on the door) Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!
271	Chandler	 I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
272		(Chandlers opens the door. A beautiful woman stands at the doorway.)
273	Kori	 Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
274	Chandler	 Kori? Kori Weston?
275	Kori	 Yeah...
276	Chandler	 Wow! You look amazing!
277	Kori	 And you are...
278	Chandler	 Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
279	Monica	 You are married though.
280	Chandler	 Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
281	Kori	 I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
282	Chandler	 I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
283	Kori	 We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
284	Chandler	 I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
285	Kori	 I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
286	Ross	 (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
287	Kori	 You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)
288	Ross	 Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
289		Ending Credits
290	[Scene	 Ross' apartment]
291	Ross	 (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
