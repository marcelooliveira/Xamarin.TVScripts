2	[Scene	 Central Perk, all six are there.]
3	Monica	 Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
4	Ross	 Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
5	Rachel	 Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
6	Chandler	 We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
7	Joey	 Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
8	Phoebe	 Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
9		(Long pause.)
10	Ross	 Multiple orgasms!
11	[Scene	 Central Perk, all are there.]
12	Chandler	 So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
13	Joey	 No plans, huh?
14	Chandler	 Not a one.
15	Ross	 Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
16	Chandler	 Oh, right, right, shut up.
17	Monica	 Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
18	Chandler	 No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
19	Joey	 Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
20	Phoebe	 You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
21	Chandler	 Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
22	Phoebe	 No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
23	Ross	 Tony?
24	Monica	 Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
25	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
26	Rachel	 (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
27	Ross	 Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
28	Phoebe	 (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
29	Rachel	 It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
30	Ross	 That guy, he burns me up.
31	Rachel	 Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
32	Chandler	 Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
33	Monica	 Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
34	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
35	Phoebe	 (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
36		(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)
37	Angela	 Hi, Joey.
38	Joey	 My god, Angela.
39		(Angela takes a seat at the counter.)
40	Monica	 Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
41	Phoebe	 Are you gonna go over there?
42	Joey	 No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.
43	Angela	 (casually) Joey.
44	Joey	 You look good.
45	Angela	 That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
46	Joey	 You don't say.
47		(Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.)
48	Ross	 So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
49	Rachel	 Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
50	Ross	 Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
51	Rachel	 Who?
52	Ross	 Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
53	Rachel	 Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
54	Ross	 Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
55	Rachel	 Sure.
56		(Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)
57	Angela	 Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
58	Joey	 Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
59	Angela	 Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
60	Joey	 Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
61	Angela	 Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
62	Joey	 What?
63	Angela	 We're just friends.
64	Joey	 Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
65	Angela	 What four of us?
66	Joey	 You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
67	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself.]
68	Joey	 Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
69	Monica	 Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
70	Joey	 Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
71	Monica	 (looking out window) Oh, god help us.
72	Joey	 What?
73	Monica	 Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
74	Joey	 Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
75	Monica	 What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
76	Joey	 (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
77	[Scene	 Ross' apartment, Chandler is over.]
78	Ross	 (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
79	Chandler	 Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
80	Ross	 It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
81	Chandler	 It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
82	Ross	 Nuh-uh.
83	Chandler	 Yuh-huh.
84	Ross	 So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
85	Chandler	 Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
86	Ross	 (sheepish) No.
87	Chandler	 Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
88	Ross	 Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
89	Chandler	 There you go.
90	[Scene	 A fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]
91	Monica	 Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
92	Joey	 Yep.
93	Monica	 Which?
94	Joey	 Which what?
95	Monica	 You've never met Bob, have you?
96	Joey	 No, but he's...
97	Monica	 Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
98		(Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking.)
99	Angela	 Hey, Joey.
100	Monica	 ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
101	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their significant others.]
102	Chandler	 Where are they? Where are they?
103	Phoebe	 This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
104	Chandler	 It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
105	Phoebe	 Eww, I don't wanna do that.
106		(Janice and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.)
107	Chandler	 Here we go.
108	Phoebe	 Ok, have a good break-up.
109	Chandler	 Hey, Janice.
110	Janice	 Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
111	Chandler	 Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
112	Janice	 We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
113		(Chandler sees Phoebe breaking up with Tony. She talks to him for a few seconds, hugs him, and then he leaves. Chandler is amazed how easy it was for her.)
114	Chandler	 What?
115	Janice	 What?
116	Chandler	 (covering) What... did you get me there?
117	Janice	 I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)
118	Chandler	 Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
119	Janice	 Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
120	Chandler	 That's great.
121		(The drinks arrive, and Chandler downs his espresso in one gulp.)
122	Chandler	 Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
123	Janice	 (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.
124		(Chandler walks over to the counter where Phoebe is, and is asking her about the break-up.)
125	Chandler	 That's it?
126	Phoebe	 Yeah, it was really hard.
127	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
128	Phoebe	 Ok, you weren't there.
129	[Scene	 The Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]
130	Woman	 Comin' through. Move, move.
131	Rachel	 Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
132	Woman	 Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
133	Rachel	 But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
134	Woman	 Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
135	Rachel	 What?
136	Woman	 No suds, no save. Ok?
137		(Ross arrives.)
138	Ross	 What's goin' on?
139	Rachel	 Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
140	Ross	 Was your basket on top?
141	Rachel	 Yeah, but, there were no suds.
142	Ross	 So?
143	Rachel	 Well, you know, no suds, no save.
144	Ross	 No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine.
145	Woman	 Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
146	Ross	 Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
147		(The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff out of the machine and leaves.)
148	Ross	 (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
149	Rachel	 That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
150	Ross	 Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
151		(Ross pulls out a huge box of laundry detergent.)
152	Rachel	 What's that?
153	Ross	 Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
154		(Rachel starts to load her clothes.)
155	Ross	 Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
156	Rachel	 Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
157	Ross	 Rach, have you never done this before?
158	Rachel	 Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
159	Ross	 Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
160	Rachel	 (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
161	Ross	 (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
162	[Scene	 Fancy restaurant, Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table.]
163	Monica	 (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?
164	Angela	 Brooklyn Heights.
165	Bob	 Cleveland.
166	Monica	 How, how did that happen?
167	Joey	 Oh my god.
168	Monica	 What?
169	Joey	 I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
170	[Scene	 Fancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking.]
171	Joey	 So, you and Angela, huh?
172	Bob	 Yep. Pretty much.
173	Joey	 You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
174	Bob	 Huh, I never really noticed.
175	Joey	 Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
176	Bob	 Monica, Monica is great.
177	Joey	 Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
178	[Scene	 The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking.]
179	Monica	 I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
180	Angela	 Yeah, isn't he?
181	Monica	 It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
182	Angela	 You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
183	Monica	 Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
184	Angela	 Huh. That's nice.
185	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice.]
186	Phoebe	 Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
187		(Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.)
188	Chandler	 Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
189	Janice	 All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.
190	[Scene	 The laundromat.]
191	Rachel	 Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
192	Ross	 That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
193	Rachel	 What uh-oh?
194	Ross	 (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
195	Rachel	 Ross, what's the matter?
196	Ross	 Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
197	Rachel	 Come on, show me.
198	Ross	 All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
199	Rachel	 Oh, everything's pink.
200	Ross	 Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
201	Rachel	 Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
202		(The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and laughs.)
203	[Scene	 The fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt, and Monica is very uncomfortable.]
204	Monica	 Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
205		(Her and Joey walk away from the table.)
206	Monica	 Oh my god.
207	Joey	 What?
208	Monica	 Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
209	Joey	 Come on, they're close.
210	Monica	 Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
211	Joey	 Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
212	Monica	 Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?
213	Joey	 Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
214	Monica	 Oh my god, what were you thinking?
215	Joey	 All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
216	Monica	 (hits him lightly) Oh!
217	Joey	 Ow!
218	Monica	 (leaving) I'm outta here.
219	Joey	 Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
220	Monica	 Really?
221	Joey	 Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
222		[Time lapse, Monica accidentally spilled her drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off. Joey is making eyes at Angela.]
223	Monica	 I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
224		(Angela is eating chicken wings and making the weasel-like noise Joey had told Bob about.)
225	Joey	 Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
226	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is still trying to ease things over with Janice, and there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]
227	Chandler	 Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
228	Janice	 Ow!
229	Chandler	 Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
230	Janice	 Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
231		(She leaves.)
232	Chandler	 (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
233	Phoebe	 Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?
234	Chandler	 Oh, I don't know, a million?
235	Phoebe	 Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
236	Chandler	 I'm fine.
237	Phoebe	 All right.
238		(Janice returns from the bathroom.)
239	Chandler	 I'm not fine. Here she comes.
240	Phoebe	 Wait here. Breathe.
241		(Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few seconds, and then Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to Chandler, and leaves.)
242	Chandler	 How do you do that?
243	Phoebe	 It's like a gift.
244	Chandler	 We should always always break up together.
245	Phoebe	 Oh, I'd like that.
246	[Scene	 The Launderama. Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]
247	Ross	 You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
248	Rachel	 Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
249		(The same woman walks over and takes Rachel's laundry cart.)
250	Rachel	 Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
251	Woman	 Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
252		(Rachel looks at Ross, who motions to her to get the cart back.)
253	Rachel	 I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
254	Woman	 Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
255	Rachel	 Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
256	Woman	 Let go!
257		(They struggle for the cart. Finally, Rachel climbs inside of it.)
258	Rachel	 All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
259		(She thinks it over, and then walks away.)
260	Rachel	 (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
261	Ross	 You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
262	Rachel	 I could not have done this without you.
263		(Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of silence follows.)
264	Ross	 Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
265	Rachel	 Are you sure?
266	Ross	 No.
267		Closing Credits
268	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has an icepack to his head.]
269	Rachel	 Oh, are you sure you're ok?
270	Ross	 Yeah.
271	Rachel	 Does it still hurt?
272	Ross	 Yeah.
273	Phoebe	 (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
274		(Monica and Joey enter.)
275	Monica	 Hi.
276	Phoebe	 Hey, how'd it go?
277	Joey	 Excellent.
278	Monica	 We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
279	Ross	 What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
280	Monica	 (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
281	Rachel	 Where's Chandler?
282	Phoebe	 Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
283		(Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.)
284	Chandler	 I'm free! I'm free!
285	Phoebe	 That oughta do it.
286		End
