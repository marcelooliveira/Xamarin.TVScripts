3	Joey	 Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
4	Chandler	 Or... Dick.
5	Ross	 (entering) Hey.
6	Chandler and Joey	 Hey.
7	Ross	 Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
8	Chandler	 Was it like a sneeze only better?
9	Ross	 No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
10	Joey	 (with a disgusted look) What was it?
11	Ross	 Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)
12	Chandler and Joey	 Whoa!!!
13	Chandler	 No!!
14	Ross	 Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)
15	Chandler	 Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
16	Ross	 Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.)
17	Joey	 No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
18	Ross	 Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
19	Chandler	 No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a…
20	Rachel	 (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)
21	Chandler	 Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
22	Ross	 Ahhh.
23	Joey	 Yeah, right.

25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Rachel are there, as Phoebe enters with her date.]
27	Phoebe	 (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. (points to the stage)
28	Vince	 Good deal.
29	Phoebe	 Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
30	Rachel	 Hi!
31	Chandler	 Hey!
32	Vince	 Hey!
33	Phoebe	 Vince is a fireman.
34	Rachel	 Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
35	Vince	 98 hot saves, highest in the force.
36	Chandler	 Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
37	Vince	 (dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.
38	Chandler	 You're right, I know.
39	Vince	 (to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See you Saturday. (leaves)
40	Phoebe	 Okay. (watches him leave)
41	Rachel	 Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
42	Phoebe	 Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
43	Rachel	 What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
44	Phoebe	 I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
45	Joey	 So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
46	Phoebe	 Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.
47	Ross	 (entering) Hey guys!
48	Joey	 Hey.
49	Rachel	 Hi!
50		(He goes over and sits down at the counter, all depressed.)
51	Joey	 (going over to him) Well?!
52	Chandler	 (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
53	Ross	 Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
54	Joey	 Well what is it?!
55	Ross	 He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
56	Chandler	 Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
57	Ross	 At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
58	Joey	 Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
59	Ross	 (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!
60		[cut to Phoebe and Rachel as Monica returns from the bathroom]
61	Monica	 Pete's breaking up with me.
62	All	 What?!
63	Monica	 I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
64	Rachel	 And?
65	Monica	 Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
66	Joey	 Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
67	Monica	 Really?!
68	Joey	 Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
69	[Scene	 A Street, Phoebe is walking with her second date, Jason.]
70	Jason	 ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
71	Phoebe	 That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) Oh my God!
72	Jason	 Whoa!
73	Phoebe	 (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!
74	Jason	 Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
75	Phoebe	 (stopping him) No! No!
76	Jason	 No, no?
77	Phoebe	 Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
78	Jason	 W-w-w-wait! Why?!
79	Phoebe	 Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)
80	[Scene	 A Doctor's Office, Ross is having his thing looked at by Dr. Rhodes.]
81	Ross	 Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
82	Dr. Rhodes	 Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. (Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?
83	Ross	 Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
84	Dr. Rhodes	 Well that's not a third nipple.
85	Ross	 No?
86	Dr. Rhodes	 First of all, it's on your ass.
87	Ross	 Well then, what is it?!
88	Dr. Rhodes	 Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
89	Dr. Johnson	 I'm with Hamilton!
90	Dr. Rhodes	 He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
91	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are there.]
92	Monica	 (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
93	Chandler	 Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
94	Joey	 Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
95	Phoebe	 (entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
96	Rachel	 Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
97	Phoebe	 (disgusted) Uh.
98	Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
99	Phoebe	 Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
100	Rachel	 So Pheebs, pick one of them.
101	Monica	 Yeah. Which one do you like more?
102	Phoebe	 Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)
103	Joey	 Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
104	Phoebe	 Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
105	Chandler	 Well sensitive is important, pick him.
106	Phoebe	 Yeah.
107	Joey	 Oh sure, go with the sissy.
108	Phoebe	 Jason is not a sissy!
109	Joey	 Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
110	[Scene	 Dr. Rhodes's Office, a rather large group of doctors has now gathered to take a look at Ross's thing. Ross is none too pleased with the developments, he has a disgusted look on his face.]
111	Ross	 Y'know I have dinner plans!!
112	Dr. Rhodes	 Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
113		(He removes the blanket covering the thing.)
114	All	 Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)
115	[Scene	 Pete's apartment, Monica is there to water the plants, and is showing the gang around.]
116	Monica	 Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
117	Ross	 Yes, and the dimmer switch.
118	Joey	 Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
119	Monica	 No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
120	Chandler	 (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
121	Rachel	 (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.
122	Phoebe	 God, that is the nicest kitchen.
123	Monica	 I know.
124	Phoebe	 No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
125	Joey	 Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
126	Monica	 Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)
127	Pete	 Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)
128	Monica	 I guess that's how.
129	Pete	 Hey Monica, how's it going.
130	Monica	 Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.
131	Pete	 Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
132	Rachel	 (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
133	Pete	 I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
134	All	 (standing up) Hey Pete.
135	Joey	 Hi, how ya doing?
136	Monica	 Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
137	Pete	 Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. (clicks his remote) (to his other call) Hey, how's it going?
138	Monica	 Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
139	Pete	 Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah. (listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.

142	Monica	 I love you.
143	All	 I love you, love you.
144	Monica	 Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
145	Chandler	 So, what do you thing the good news is?
146	Joey	 (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
147		[pause]
148	Monica	 Oh my.
149	Rachel	 Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
150	Ross	 Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
151		(Pete's computer automatically calls Mom, Pete's Mom.)
152	Pete's Mom	 Hello.
153	Monica	 And that's Pete's Mom.
154		(The gang quickly hides again.)
155		Commercial Break
156	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is returning from Pete’s.]
157	Rachel	 Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.
158	Monica	 Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.
159	Chandler	 Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
160	Monica	 Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.
161	Ross	 Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.
162	Rachel	 Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
163		(Joey laughs, Ross glares at him, and Joey stops.)
164	Phoebe	 All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
165	Chandler	 Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?
166	Phoebe	 Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
167	All	 Good luck!
168		(pause)
169	Rachel	 OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.
170	[Scene	 A Fire House, Phoebe has gone to break up with Vince.]
171	Phoebe	 Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
172	Fireman	 Oh sure. Vince?!
173	Vince	 Yo!! (slides down that pole that fire station’s have)
174	Phoebe	 Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.
175	Vince	 So, what’s up?
176	Phoebe	 Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.
177	Vince	 Uh-huh. G-good deal.
178	Phoebe	 I’m sorry.
179	Vince	 No-no it’s okay. It’s just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and… (starts choking up) That there’s so much in me I have to share with you yet.
180	Phoebe	 Oh my God, I didn’t…
181	Vince	 (starting to cry) I’m sorry, I can’t talk. I’m gonna go write in my journal. (walks away)
182	Phoebe	 (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
183	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Monica are there.]
184	Phoebe	 (to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
185	Ross	 Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.
186	Monica	 Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
187	Ross	 Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)
188	Rachel	 (entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist.
189	Monica	 Brides magazines?
190	Rachel	 Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the picture.)
191	Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both look at her.) Like for clubbing.
192	Monica	 It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
193	Rachel	 Oh my God. (starting to cry)
194	Monica	 I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
195	Phoebe	 Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
196	Rachel	 You didn’t break up with that fireman?
197	Phoebe	 No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
198	Rachel	 Wow!
199	Phoebe	 Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
200	Monica	 So then, are you going to dump Jason?
201	Phoebe	 Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So… It’s really just about the math.
202	[Scene	 Jason’s apartment, Phoebe has gone to break up with Jason.]
203	Phoebe	 (knocks on the door) Jason?
204	Jason	 Yeah, come on in.
205		(She goes in, and sees Jason without his shirt. It turns out that he has a great body too, and is at a loss for words.)
206	Jason	 So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
207	Phoebe	 Nah-ha!
208	[Scene	 Phoebe’s Herbal Guy’s office, Ross is there about his thing. Ross is looking around the exam room, and he goes over to a large bank of drawers, pulls one out and almost spills it as the herbalist, Guru Saj, enters.]
209	Guru Saj	 You must be Ross.
210	Ross	 Hi.
211	Guru Saj	 I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)
212	Ross	 Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...
213	Guru Saj	 Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I’ve attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let’s take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. (motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it) Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it’s a koondis!
214	Ross	 What’s a koondis?
215	Guru Saj	 I don’t know, what’s a koondis with you? (starts laughing as if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! I’ve got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
216	Ross	 I guess it’s worth a try.
217	Guru Saj	 Oh sure, we should see results—Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! (quickly wipes it off)
218	Ross	 What?! What?!
219	Guru Saj	 We appear to have angered it.
220	Ross	 We?! We angered it?!
221	Guru Saj	 Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonna have to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a ‘What?’ look) Love.
222	Ross	 Oh God!
223	Guru Saj	 (He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to…
224	Ross	 Ow!!
225	Guru Saj	 Oops.
226	Ross	 What was, what was that?
227	Guru Saj	 Well it’s gone.
228	Ross	 What?! How’s that?
229	Guru Saj	 It got caught on my watch.
230	Ross	 Hey! (congratulates him)
231	[Scene	 Pete’s apartment, Pete and Monica are coming back from a date.]
232	Pete	 Lights. (The lights turn on, once again they’re too bright.) Uh, romantic lights. (The lights dim.)
233	Monica	 Ooh, nice.
234	Pete	 So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
235	Monica	 Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
236	Pete	 Well ah, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life…
237	Monica	 Yeah?
238	Pete	 And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
239	Monica	 Wow.
240	Pete	 There’s one thing missing.
241	Monica	 What’s that?
242	Pete	 It’s time for me to conquer the physical world.
243	Monica	 Okay. (not sure of herself)
244	Pete	 Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
245	Monica	 You wanna what?!
246	Pete	 I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states!
247	Monica	 What are you talking about?
248	Pete	 Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed.
249	Monica	 And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
250	Pete	 Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
251	Monica	 My parents will be so happy.
252	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe’s singing, Vince is also there.]
253	Phoebe	 (singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
254		(They all applaud her.)
255	Jason	 (going up to her) Hey. I was…
256	Phoebe	 Hey!
257	Jason	 I was passin’ by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it’s kinda cool seeing you up there. (kisses her)
258	Vince	 (running over) Whoa! Hey-hey! What’s going on here? Who is this guy?
259	Phoebe	 I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
260	Vince	 What?!
261	Jason	 What?!
262	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.
263	Vince	 Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it’s okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
264	Jason	 Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
265	Phoebe	 Really?!
266	Jason	 Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven’t been going out that long. Come on, we haven’t even slept together yet. Huh.
267	Vince	 You haven’t?
268	Jason	 You have?
269	Phoebe	 Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)
270	Jason	 (to Phoebe) I-I can’t believe this! You-you’ve slept with him?!
271	Phoebe	 Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
272	Jason	 Y'know Phoebe, I’m gonna make this real easy for you. (walks out)
273	Phoebe	 (to Vince) Well, that could’ve been really awkward.
274	Vince	 You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
275	Phoebe	 Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.
276	Vince	 Uh yeah, I can’t believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)

281	Joey	 Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
282	Guru Saj	 Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
