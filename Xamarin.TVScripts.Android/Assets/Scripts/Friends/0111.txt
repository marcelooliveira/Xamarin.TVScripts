3	Phoebe	 Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
4	Monica	 Why?
5	Phoebe	 Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
6	Monica	 Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
7	Phoebe	 Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.
8	Monica	 He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
9		(The guy walks past them)
10	Guy	 Nice hat.
11	Monica and Phoebe	 (in unison) Thanks.
12		(The guy walks on)
13	Phoebe	 We should do something. Whistle.
14	Monica	 We are not going to whistle.
15	Phoebe	 Come on, do it.
16	Monica	 No!
17	Phoebe	 Do it!
18	Monica	 No!
19	Phoebe	 Do it do it do it!
20	Monica	 (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
21		(The guy turns round, startled. Monica points to Phoebe. The guy gets hit by a truck)
22	Phoebe	 I can't believe you did that!
23		Opening Credits
24	[Scene	 Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting.]
25	Monica	 Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
26	Phoebe	 I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
27	Monica	 Phoebe, what are you doing?
28	Phoebe	 Maybe nobody's tried this.
29	Monica	 I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
30	Phoebe	 Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
31	Monica	 Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
32	Phoebe	 Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
33	Monica	 I wish all guys could be like him.
34	Phoebe	 I know.
35	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are telling everyone about their coma guy.]
36	Chandler	 Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
37	Monica	 He doesn't have anyone.
38	Phoebe	 Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
39	Joey	 I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
40	Rachel	 Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)
41	Jay Leno	 (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound'
42		(Everyone has settled down to watch, except Chandler)
43	Chandler	 Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
44	Rachel	 No way, forget it.
45	Joey	 C'mon, she's your mom!
46	Chandler	 Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
47	Rachel	 Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
48	Chandler	 Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
49	Ross	 C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
50	Chandler	 You can say that because she's not your mom.
51	Ross	 Oh, please...
52		(Rachel opens the door to Paolo)
53	Paolo	 Bona sera.
54	Rachel	 Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)
55	Ross	 When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
56	Monica	 Last night.
57	Ross	 Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
58	Phoebe	 Hey hey hey! She's on!
59	Paolo	 Ah! Nora Bing!
60	Jay Leno	 (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
61	Phoebe	 Your mom was arrested?
62	Chandler	 Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
63	Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
64	Chandler	 Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
65	All	 Shhh.
66	Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
67	Chandler	 THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
68	Jay Leno	 (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
69	Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
70	All	 Awww!
71	Chandler	 This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
72	Jay Leno	 (on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
73	Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
74		(The gang turn to look at Chandler)
75	Chandler	 ...And then he burst into flames.
76	[Scene	 The Hospital, it's a montage of Monica and Phoebe's visit to the hospital with My Guy playing in the background. It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to him.]
77	Monica	 Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
78		[Next is a shot of them dragging an enormous plant into the room, then Monica knitting a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]
79	Phoebe	 What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
80	Monica	 Nah... not-not special enough.
81	Phoebe	 Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
82	Monica	 Waaay too special.
83	[Scene	 A Mexican Restaurant, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there.]
84	Mrs. Bing	 I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)
85	Chandler	 Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
86	Mrs. Bing	 Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
87	Chandler	 Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
88	Ross	 (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
89	Mrs. Bing	 Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down) Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
90	Chandler	 I know I am.
91	Mrs. Bing	 Who's doing shots?
92	Monica	 Yeah.
93	Phoebe	 I'm in.
94	Mrs. Bing	 There y'go. Ross?
95	Ross	 Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
96		(Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered)
97	Rachel	 Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
98	Ross	 ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
99		[Time lapse. Ross is now clearly drunk. He is holding up a shot glass to his eye like a jeweller's eye.]
100	Ross	 Anyone want me to appraise anything?
101		(Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)
102	Rachel	 Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
103	Mrs. Bing	 Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
104	Chandler	 Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
105		[Cut to Mrs. Bing on the telephone.]
106	Mrs. Bing	 Yeah, any messages for room 226?
107		(Ross emerges from a toilet marked 'Chicas')
108	Mrs. Bing	 You okay there, slugger?
109	Ross	 Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)
110	Mrs. Bing	 What is with you tonight?
111	Ross	 Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
112	Mrs. Bing	 (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
113	Ross	 No. It's the one he's licking.
114	Mrs. Bing	 She's supposed to be with you.
115	Ross	 You're good.
116	Mrs. Bing	 Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
117	Ross	 The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
118	Mrs. Bing	 No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
119	Ross	 When?
120	Mrs. Bing	 He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
121	Ross	 The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
122	Mrs. Bing	 No, it's you!
123	Ross	 Please.
124	Mrs. Bing	 No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
125	Ross	 Right.
126	Mrs. Bing	 You are gonna be fine, believe me.
127		(She kisses him on the cheek)
128	Ross	 Uh-oh...
129		(...Then full on the mouth)
130		(Enter Joey)
131	Joey	 Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
132		Commercial Break
133	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, the next morning. Joey is getting the door in his dressing gownâ€”it's Ross.]
134	Ross	 Hey, is Chandler here?
135	Joey	 Yeah.
136		(Ross drags Joey into the hall and slams the door)
137	Ross	 Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
138	Joey	 Right. No big deal.
139	Ross	 Okay.
140	Joey	 In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
141	Ross	 What code?
142	Joey	 You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
143		(Chandler opens the door and startles them. He picks up the paper)
144	Chandler	 What are you guys doing out here?
145	Ross	 Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
146	Joey	 Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
147	Ross	 No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
148	Joey	 Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
149	Chandler	 Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
150	Ross	 Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
151	Joey	 Ross, how could you let this happen?
152	Ross	 I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
153	Joey	 You don't think my mom's sexy?
154	Ross	 Well... not in the same way...
155	Joey	 I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
156	Ross	 Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
157		(Monica and Rachel's door opens and Rachel and Paolo emerge)
158	Rachel	 Hey.
159	Ross	 Hey.
160	Rachel	 What're you guys doing out here?
161	Ross	 Well, not playing raquetball!
162	Joey	 He forgot to leave his grip size!
163	Ross	 He didn't get the goggles!
164	Rachel	 Well,sounds like you two have issues.
165		(She and Paolo walk a little way down the hall)
166	Rachel	 Goodbye, baby.
167	Paolo	 Ciao, bela.
168		(They kiss. Ross is watching them)
169	Ross	 Do they wait for me to do this?
170		(Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel's apartment)
171	Joey	 So are you gonna tell him?
172	Ross	 Why would I tell him?
173	Joey	 How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
174	Ross	 Oh...
175	Monica	 (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
176	Joey	 Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
177	Monica	 ...What did I ask?
178	[Scene	 Hospital. Phoebe is there stroking Coma Guy's hair, when Monica enters with a bunch of balloons.]
179	Monica	 Hi.
180	Phoebe	 Hi.
181	Monica	 What are you doing here?
182	Phoebe	 Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
183	Monica	 I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
184	Phoebe	 No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
185	Monica	 How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
186	Phoebe	 Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
187	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross is talking to Chandler. Joey is making a snack at the bar.]
188	Chandler	 Oh my God.
189	Ross	 You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
190	Chandler	 I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
191	Ross	 Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
192	Chandler	 What?
193	Ross	 I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
194	Chandler	 (To Joey) You knew about this?
195	Joey	 Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
196	Chandler	 I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
197	Joey	 Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
198	Ross	 Thanks, man, big help.
199	Chandler	 (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
200	Ross	 I wasn't- I mean, I-
201	Chandler	 Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
202	Ross	 I know-
203	Chandler	 I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
204	Ross	 Chandler-
205	Joey	 Me neither, y'know what-
206	Chandler	 I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
207	Joey	 What are you mad at me for?!
208	Ross	 Chandler-
209	Chandler	 You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
210	Joey	 (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?
211	Ross	 Joey-
212	Joey	 Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
213	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there except for Chandler. Rachel is writing something and Monica walks up.]
214	Monica	 Hey.
215	Rachel	 Hey.
216	Monica	 (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
217	Rachel	 Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
218	Monica	 (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
219	Phoebe	 (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
220	Rachel	 Hey.
221	Phoebe	 Hello.
222	Monica	 Hello.
223	Phoebe	 Going to the hospital tonight?
224	Monica	 No, you?
225	Phoebe	 No, you?
226	Monica	 You just asked me.
227	Phoebe	 Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?
228	Rachel	 Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
229	Joey	 (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
230	Ross	 I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
231	Joey	 C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
232	Rachel	 (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
233	Phoebe	 Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) 'Kay. (Sung
234		You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
235		(She sees Monica sneaking out) Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break! (Runs out, knocking over the mike stand)
236	Rachel	 (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
237		(Enter Chandler)
238	Chandler	 What was that?
239	Ross	 Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
240	Chandler	 Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
241	Joey	 (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
242	Ross	 Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
243	Chandler	 Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
244	Ross	 Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
245	Chandler	 Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
246		(People turn to look)
247	Ross	 (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
248	Chandler	 That's very funny. We done now?
249	Ross	 No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
250	Chandler	 That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
251	Ross	 Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
252	[Scene	 The Coma Guy's Room, Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe. There is no sign of Coma Guy. His bed is empty.]
253	Phoebe	 Alright, whadyou do with him?
254		(There is the sound of a flushing toilet and Coma Guy emerges from the bathroom)
255	Monica	 Oh! You're awake!
256	Phoebe	 Look at you! How, how do you feel?
257	Coma Guy	 Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
258	Monica	 You look good!
259	Coma Guy	 I feel good! ...Who are you?
260	Monica	 Oh, sorry.
261	Phoebe	 I'm Phoebe Buffay.
262	Monica	 I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
263	Phoebe	 Well, we both have.
264	Coma Guy	 So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
265	Phoebe	 Well, actually it's just from me.
266	Monica	 I got you the foot massager.
267	Phoebe	 You know who shaved you? That was me.
268	Monica	 I read to you.
269	Phoebe	 I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
270	Coma Guy	 Well,... thanks.
271	Monica	 Oh, my pleasure.
272	Phoebe	 You're welcome.
273	Coma Guy	 So. I guess I'll see you around.
274	Phoebe	 What, that's it?
275	Monica	 "See you around?"
276	Coma Guy	 Well, what do you want me to say?
277	Monica	 Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
278	Coma Guy	 Alright, I'll call you.
279	Phoebe	 I don't think you mean that.
280	Monica	 This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
281	Phoebe	 Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
282	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's Chandler is talking with his mom.]
283	Mrs. Bing	 Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
284	Chandler	 No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
285	Mrs. Bing	 Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)
286	Chandler	 You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
287	Mrs. Bing	 (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
288	Chandler	 Really stupid.
289	Mrs. Bing	 Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
290	Chandler	 Yeah. No. No...
291		[Cut to the hallway, Joey is listening to Chandler and his mom's conversation through the door as Ross walks up.]
292	Ross	 Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
293	Joey	 Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
294	Ross	 You're kidding.
295	Joey	 No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
296	Ross	 Wow!
297	Joey	 Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
298	Ross	 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
299	Joey	 That makes more sense.
300	Ross	 So, what's going on now?
301	Joey	 I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
302	Ross	 Whaddya see?
303	Joey	 Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
304		(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Monica and Rachel's apartment, but it is locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn't listening. Chandler and his mom come out)
305	Mrs. Bing	 You okay, kiddo?
306	Chandler	 Yeah, okay.
307	Mrs. Bing	 Alright. (Kisses him)
308	Chandler	 Nice save.
309		(She walks down the hall)
310	Ross	 (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
311	Mrs. Bing	 Mr. Geller.
312		(She leaves)
313		(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel's door)
314	Chandler	 Hey.
315	Ross	 You mean that?
316	Chandler	 Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
317	Ross	 Yeah? How'd it go?
318	Chandler	 Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
319	Ross	 Well, howdya feel?
320	Chandler	 Pretty good! I told her.
321	Ross	 Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go down that road.
322		Closing Credits
323	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is handing out copies of her book to the gang.]
324	Rachel	 Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
325	Monica	 What's a 'niffle'?
326	Joey	 You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
327	Rachel	 Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
328	Ross	 Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
329	Rachel	 Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
330	All	 Nooo!
