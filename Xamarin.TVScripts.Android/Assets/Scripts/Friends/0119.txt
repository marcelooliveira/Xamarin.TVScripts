3	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is talking to a customer.]
4	Rachel	 Okay, okay, I checked. We have
5		Opening Credits
6	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica enters with some mail.]
7	Monica	 Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
8	Rachel	 Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
9	Monica	 Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
10	Rachel	 Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
11	Monica	 What is it?
12	Rachel	 Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
13	Monica	 Barry who you almost...?
14	Rachel	 Barry who I almost.
15	Monica	 And Mindy, your maid of...?
16	Rachel	 Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
17	Monica	 (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
18	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are eating Chinese.]
19	Ross	 Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
20	Rachel	 What?
21	Ross	 Hi.
22	Rachel	 Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
23	Ross	 Really.
24	Rachel	 No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
25	Ross	 Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
26	Rachel	 Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
27	Ross	 Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
28	Rachel	 Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
29	Ross	 Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
30		(Enter the other four)
31	Monica	 Hi.
32	Ross	 ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
33	Rachel	 Hi, how was the movie?
34	Monica	 Wonderful!
35	Phoebe	 So good!
36	Joey	 Suck-fest.
37	Chandler	 Toootal chick-flick.
38	Phoebe	 I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
39	Joey	 Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
40	Monica	 There was nudity!
41	Joey	 I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
42	Monica and Phoebe	 Hugh! Hugh Grant!
43	Ross	 Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
44	Chandler	 They're still just friends, right?
45	Rachel	 (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
46	Ross	 That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
47	Monica	 Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
48	Ross	 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
49	[Scene	 Joe-G's Pizza, the guys are there.]
50	Chandler	 I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
51	Joey	 I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
52	Chandler	 I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
53	Ross	 I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
54	Joey	 She really said that?
55	Ross	 Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
56	Joey	 'Tonight' tonight?
57	Ross	 Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
58	Chandler	 I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
59	Ross	 Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
60	Chandler	 Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
61	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a soap opera.]
62	Rachel	 Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)
63		[Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachel's.]
64	Joey	 How could you lose him?
65	Rachel	 I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
66	Monica	 Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
67	Rachel	 I don't know. The left one.
68	Monica	 Which ones?
69	Rachel	 Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
70	Phoebe	 (Entering) Hey.
71	All	 Hi.
72	Phoebe	 Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
73	Chandler	 Rachel lost Marcel.
74	Phoebe	 Oh no, how?
75	Monica	 He- he pooped in my shoe.
76	Phoebe	 Which one?
77	Monica	 Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
78	Phoebe	 No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
79	Rachel	 C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
80	Joey	 Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
81	Chandler	 Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
82	Rachel	 Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
83	Monica	 Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
84	Rachel	 Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
85	Monica	 Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
86		(They all leave)
87	Rachel	 Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
88		[Cut to a hallway in the building, Monica and Phoebe are knocking on a door. Mr. Heckles emerges.]
89	Mr. Heckles	 Whaddyou want?
90	Monica	 Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
91	Mr. Heckles	 I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
92	Monica	 No!
93	Phoebe	 Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
94	Mr. Heckles	 I wasn't ready for it.
95	Monica	 A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
96	Mr. Heckles	 Saw Regis Philbin once...
97	Phoebe	 Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)
98	Mr. Heckles	 You owe me a waffle.
99		[Cut to Monica and Rachel's.]
100	Rachel	 (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
101	Ross	 Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
102	Rachel	 Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
103	Ross	 Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
104	Rachel	 Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
105	Ross	 Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-
106	Rachel	 Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
107	Ross	 Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine)
108	Rachel	 Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
109	Ross	 Oh, what? What-what?
110	Rachel	 Y'know Marcel?
111	Ross	 ...Yeah?
112	Rachel	 Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
113		[Cut to outside the window, with Ross reacting with disbelief. The shot pans back until we see Marcel sitting on the window ledge.]
114		Commercial Break
115	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
116	Ross	 (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
117	Rachel	 I know, I know, I'm sorry-
118	Ross	 No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
119	Rachel	 (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
120	Intercom	 Animal Control.
121	Rachel	 See? I've even called Animal Control!
122	Ross	 You called Animal Control?
123	Rachel	 Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
124	Ross	 Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
125	Rachel	 O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
126	Ross	 That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
127		(A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it)
128	Rachel	 Hi, thanks for coming.
129	Luisa	 (Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?
130	Rachel	 Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
131	Ross	 Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
132	Rachel	 Turned out it was a hat.
133	Ross	 Cat!
134	Rachel	 Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
135		(Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)
136	Monica	 Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
137	Luisa	 Marcel?
138	Ross	 My uncle Marcel.
139	Phoebe	 Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
140	Luisa	 Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
141	Phoebe	 Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
142	Monica	 Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
143	Phoebe	 Yes, but there isn't always time!
144	Monica	 Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
145	Luisa	 Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
146	Rachel	 Yeah!
147	Luisa	 Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
148	Rachel	 Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
149	Monica	 The Luisa from home room!
150	Rachel	 Yes!!
151	Luisa	 You have no idea who I am, do you.
152	Monica	 No, none at all.
153	Rachel	 None.
154	Luisa	 Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
155	Monica	 Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
156	Luisa	 Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch!
157	Rachel	 What?!
158	Monica	 Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
159	Luisa	 I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)
160	Phoebe	 Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
161		[Cut to another part of the building. We see Marcel jump in through a window and run down some stairs, then Chandler and Joey come down from the upper floor without noticing.]
162	Chandler	 Marcel?
163	Joey	 Marcel?
164	Chandler	 Marcel?
165	Joey	 Marcel?
166		(They come to a door and silently agree to try it. A very sweaty woman emerges)
167	Woman No. 1	 Hi, can I help you?
168		(Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment)
169	Chandler	 Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
170	Joey	 A monkey.
171	Chandler	 Yes have you seen any?
172	Woman No. 1	 No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
173	Joey	 Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
174	Woman No. 1	 Of course.
175	Joey	 Oh. Then, no.
176		(Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend)
177	Woman No. 2	 Did I put too much rum in here?
178		(Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances)
179	Woman No. 1	 Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She starts to shut the door)
180	Chandler	 Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
181	Joey	 Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
182	Chandler	 Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
183	Joey	 We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
184		(The women quickly shut the door)
185	Chandler	 Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
186	Joey	 Marcel?
187	Chandler	 Marcel?!
188		[Cut to Monica and Phoebe searching the basement.]
189	Phoebe	 Marcel?
190	Monica	 Marcel?
191	Phoebe	 Marcel?
192	Both	 Marcel?
193	Phoebe	 Oh-my-God!
194	Monica	 Whaaat!
195	Phoebe	 Something just brushed up against my right leg!
196	Monica	 What is it?
197	Phoebe	 Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
198		(Marcel makes a monkeyish noise. He is sitting in the corner)
199	Monica	 Look, Phoebe!
200	Phoebe	 Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
201		(Luisa appears on the stairs)
202	Luisa	 Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)
203	Monica	 What're you gonna do?
204	Luisa	 Just a small tranquiliser.
205		(In slow motion we see Phoebe look at Marcel, then at Luisa. She jumps toward Marcel just as Luisa fires the gun.)
206	Monica	 Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
207	Phoebe	 Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.
208	Monica	 Oh gosh.
209		[Cut to Marcel walking along a hallway. He notices a banana on the floor and picks it up. The hand of an unseen person grabs him and carries him away. Then cut to Ross and Rachel on the street outside.]
210	Ross	 Marcel?
211	Rachel	 Marcel?
212	Ross	 Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
213	Rachel	 Ross, you don't know that.
214	Ross	 Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
215	Rachel	 Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
216	Ross	 Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
217	Rachel	 Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
218	Ross	 Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
219	Rachel	 Ross.
220	Ross	 I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
221	Rachel	 Ross.
222	Ross	 Oh, forget it, okay?
223	Rachel	 Ross!
224	Ross	 What? What?
225		(A man carrying a box of bananas walks past them. They stare for a minute and then hobble after him)
226	Both	 Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
227	(Scene 4	 Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas. He bangs on the door)
228	Phoebe	 Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
229		(Mr. Heckles opens the door)
230	Ross	 Hi, did you order some bananas?
231	Mr. Heckles	 What about it?
232	Ross	 Gimme back my monkey.
233	Mr. Heckles	 I don't have a monkey.
234	Rachel	 Then what's with all the bananas?
235	Mr. Heckles	 Potassium.
236		(There is a monkey-like noise from within and Ross pushes past Mr. Heckles and enters his apartment)
237	Ross	 Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
238		(Marcel jumps into view wearing a pink dress. Everybody gasps)
239	Ross	 Marcel! What've you done to him?
240	Mr. Heckles	 That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
241	Ross	 Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
242	Mr. Heckles	 C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)
243	Ross	 C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
244	Mr. Heckles	 C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)
245	Luisa	 (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.
246	Ross	 Okay, gimme my monkey back.
247	Mr. Heckles	 That's my monkey.
248	Luisa	 You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
249	Mr. Heckles	 That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
250	Ross	 Alright, I want my monkey.
251	Luisa	 No!
252	Rachel	 Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
253	Luisa	 Sorry, prom queen.
254	Ross	 (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
255	Rachel	 Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
256	Luisa	 Nope.
257	Rachel	 Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
258	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress off Marcel.]
259	Ross	 It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
260	Rachel	 Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
261	Ross	 Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
262	Rachel	 Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
263	Ross	 Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
264	Rachel	 That'd be good.
265	Ross	 Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
266		(Barry bursts in)
267	Barry	 Rachel.
268	Rachel	 Barry?!
269	Barry	 I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
270	Ross and Rachel	 Oh!
271	Ross	 We have got to start locking that door!
272		Closing Credits
273	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler are looking through Monica's high school yearbook]
274	Monica	 This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
275	Phoebe	 Nope.
276	Monica	 That's because I'm in front of them.
277	Chandler	 Eh. I thought that was an alp.
278	Monica	 Well, high school was not my favourite time.
279	Joey	 I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
280	Chandler	 Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
281	Monica	 Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
282	Phoebe	 Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
