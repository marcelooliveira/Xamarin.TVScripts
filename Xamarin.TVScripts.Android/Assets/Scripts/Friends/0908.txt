3		[Scene- They are in Monica's apartment and Chandler and Joey are watching TV. Monica is bringing out plates.]
4	Monica	 Hey Hon? Would you help me get the plates down?
5	Chandler	 Yeah. Hey! Here's an idea. Why don't we use our wedding china today?
6	Monica	 No, I think we should save our china for something really special...Like, if the Queen of England comes over.
7	Chandler	 Honey, she keeps cancelling on us...Take the hint!
8	Monica	 What if something gets broken? They're so expensive!
9	Chandler	 What is the point of having them, if we never use them?
10	Monica	 Ok..but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over...
11	Chandler	 I will explain it to her.
12	Monica	 Oh yeah! Like I'm going to let you talk to the Queen.
13	Joey	 Wow the parade is really good this year/Man those horses can crap! [Looks sideways at the TV in disgust]
14	Narrator from TV	 And next up is a marching band from Muskogee, Oklahoma.
15	Chandler	 Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa! WOO HOO!
16	Narrator from TV	 And here's the float with the stars of popular daytime soap, Days of Our Lives.
17		[Joey's eyes widen]
18	Joey	 Oh my god!!
19	Chandler	 Aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap Days of our Lives?
20	Joey	 Yeah!! I forgot I'm supposed to be there! I can't believe I forgot! I usually write stuff like this down on my arm!
21		[Chandler grabs Joey's left arm and rolls up his sleeve]
22	Joey	 OH! Stupid long sleeves!
23	Chandler	 What are you going to do?
24	Joey	 (sighs) I guess I'm going to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there! The producer is going to be so mad at me...He sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani! (shrugs) Like I was some kind of idiot!
25	Chandler	 Well, you proved them wrong.
26	Joey	 Yeah...
27		[Opening Credits]
28		[Scene-Rachel and Ross are in Ross' apartment. Rachel is tending to the baby. Ross is packing a bag.]
29	Rachel	 Oh Emma...This is your first Thanksgiving...What are you thankful for? Mommy's boobies?
30	Ross	 Alot of people are thankful for those!
31		[Somebody knocks on door]
32	Voice outside	 Hello? Rachel??
33	Rachel	 Who is it?
34	Voice outside	 It's your favourite sister!!
35		[Ross and Rachel look at each other]
36	Ross & Rachel (to each other)	 Jill?
37	Voice outside	 Amy!!
38	Rachel	 Hide my rings...
39		[Ross nods and goes into the back rooms. Rachel goes to open the door.]
40	Rachel	 Hey Amy!! Happy Thanksgiving!
41	Amy	 Do you have a hair straightener?
42	Rachel	 Erm...Hi! (Opens arms wide in an embrace)
43	Amy (Moves forward as if to hug Rachel then grabs her arms)	 Hi...Hair Straightener.
44	Rachel	 I haven't seen you in like a year!
45	Amy	 Oh I know, I know...I've just been crazed...
46	Rachel	 Oh...me too! Erm..I had a baby...
47	Amy	 I decorated Dad's office.
48	Rachel	 Oh..yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk of your vagina, NOT the same thing.
49	Amy	 Listen erm, about the hair straightener, honey I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house...[stops as Emma makes a sound] Oh my god...Is this Emmet?
50	Rachel	 Er..It's Emma[emphasizing on Emma]
51	Amy	 It's a girl?
52	Ross	 Hey Amy.
53	Rachel	 Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
54	Amy	 Not really. But, you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date. [Ross and Rachel look at Amy in disbelief]
55	Ross	 That was me. [Rachel laughs in her throat]
56	Amy	 No...he was this creepy guy from High School who had this huge crush on her, since like the ninth grade.
57	Ross	 Still me.
58	Amy (Giggles abit)	 No I'm not talking about you c'mon. It was your fat friend's brother with that BAD afro...
59	Ross (Cutting in)	 Okay, Amy, I'm going to save you some time ok? All me! [Makes circling action with finger]
60		[Scene-In Chandler and Monica's apartment. Joey is pacing back and forth. Chandler is helping Monica lay out the plates with her supervision.]
61	Monica	 Careful. Careful.. CAREFUL!
62	Chandler	 I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise.
63		[Silence from Monica]
64	Chandler	 Wait a minute. This isn't the china we picked out...
65	Monica	 I know! After you left the store I chose different ones.
66	Chandler	 Why?
67	Monica	 well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
68	Chandler	 Oh suddenly flowers are feminine?
69	Phoebe	 Hey everybody! Happy thanksgiving!
70	Monica, Chandler, Joey	 Hey...Happy Thanksgiving!
71	Joey	 Phoebs! [Does a "Come here!" Action]
72	Phoebe	 Hey what's going on, Joe?
73	Joey	 Listen, I...i...i... need a good lie.
74	Phoebe	 Oh...ok..How about the whole man walking on the moon thing? Y'know? You can.. you can see the strings people!
75	Joey	 No..nonono...I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at the work thing today.
76	Phoebe	 Oo. Honey, you stink at lying.
77	Joey	 Wha? I do not!
78	Phoebe	 Oh really? Let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffeehouse, I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?
79	Joey	 Somebody opened the door...to the coffeehouse, and a, Raccoon (emphasizes), came running in and went straight for your muffin I said "Hey! Don't eat that! That's Phoebe's!" and he said...[pauses for a while...realizing how stupid it sounds] He said "Joey, you stink at lying". What am I going to do?
80	Phoebe	 Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
81	Joey	 Oh that'd be great. That'd be great. Thank you.
82	Phoebe	 Sure. What was the work thing?
83		[Joey thinks for a while and rolls up his right sleeve]
84	Phoebe	 Pick up grandma at the airport?
85	Joey	 Ohhh man! [Covers his eyes and bends down]
86		[Scene- In Ross' and Rachel's apartment. Amy is using the hair straightener, Ross is drinking something and Rachel is putting the baby back in the cot.]
87	Rachel	 Oh she's precious...
88	Amy	 Do you ever worry she'll get your real nose?
89	Rachel	 Amy...Yes I do, I really do. [Reaches out toward Ross and he grabs her hand]
90		[Handphone rings]
91	Amy	 Hello? Yeah! Hang on, one second. [covers mouthpiece with hand] Can I take this upstairs?
92	Ross	 Sure! We don't live there but...
93	Amy	 Seriously? It's just these rooms? I..thought you were a doctor.
94	Rachel	 Yeah, no Ross has a PhD.
95	Amy	 Ewwww!
96		[Amy walks away toward the back rooms]
97	Rachel	 God! She is...unbelievable!
98	Ross	 I know! I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
99	Rachel	 Yeah, oh sure Ross yeah! If I have a heart attack at a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush!
100		[Amy storms out]
101	Amy	 Stupid thanksgiving!
102	Rachel	 What? What? What happened?
103	Amy	 My boyfriend cancelled on me. I mean I, I finally find a real relationship someone that I can spend this day with, and then his WIFE comes back into town. I swear, it's, it's, not even worth dating married guys.
104	Ross	 Don't say that!
105	Amy	 I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi...[Amy on the verge of crying]
106	Rachel	 Oh Amy...don't cry. Erm. Ross? Could I talk to you in private?
107	Ross	 Sure you wanna go upstairs? Or...
108		[Both of them walk into the kitchen]
109	Rachel	 Erm look. I was thinking, if it's ok with Monica, I would like to invite Amy, to Thanksgiving.
110	Ross	 You know I think that's a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims being in the Indian's syphillis.
111	Rachel	 Look, I know she's a little tough to take...but she has no where else to go. And she's my sister. Alright? And she's Emma's aunt? And I'd like them to bond...
112	Ross	 Ok...fine. But I don't want them bonding too much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
113	Rachel	 Well! Ross, you know what? She may need one we're just going to have to make our peace with that.
114		[Scene-Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross, Rachel and Amy are coming in.]
115	Rachel	 Hi!!
116	Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey	 Hey!
117	Rachel	 Hey you guys! This is my sister Amy...This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon!
118	Amy	 Oh my god! You're on Days of Our Lives!
119	Joey	 Yeah!
120	Amy	 Wow! They must put alot of make-up on you.
121	Joey(expression turns from happy to sad)	 Happ, Happy Thanksgiving. [He walks away as Chandler pats his back.]
122	Ross(to Monica)	 Hey, hey.
123	Monica	 Hi. [They exchange pecks on the cheek]
124	Monica(To Amy)	 So welcome! Is this the first time you're seeing Emma?
125	Amy	 Yeah, I thi, think so. (To Phobe who's standing behind Monica) It's nice to meet you Emma.(Sticks her hand out).
126	Phoebe(SHakes her hand)	 Phoe-be! [Articulating]
127	Amy	 Ooo! That's a funny noise!
128		[After a few moments of awkward silence, Monica leads Amy away.]
129	Joey	 Phoebs! I still need some help here.
130	Phoebe	 Oh! Right ok. Erm...ok..So it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it for example, if you look down on the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
131	Joey	 Oh...(nodding)I don't know why this is so hard for me...y'know what I mean? Lying is basically just acting, and I am a terrific actor!(Smirks)
132	Phoebe	 You are a (looks down suddenly) terrific actor!
133	Amy	 Hey! Where's the baby?
134	Rachel	 Oh we just put her down for a nap.
135	Amy	 Listen, I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died!
136	Ross	 Thank you Amy!
137	Amy	 No, no, then I would get the baby! I mean you know, it'd be just like a movie, like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion, and then I get a make-over and then I get married?
138	Phoebe(Clapping)	 That's a great movie! (Joey nods along)
139	Amy	 Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything, cos you know, you'd be dead. But, I was thinking about changing her name...I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
140	Ross	 Emma.
141	Amy(To Phoebe)	 Emma. Ross wants you.
142	Phoebe	 PHOE-BE!
143	Amy(Whispering to Ross and Rachel)	 Why does she keep making that noise?
144		[Monica and Chandler walk behind the couch and listens.]
145	Rachel	 Honey, I don't know how to tell you this but, erm...but if something were to happen to Ross or myself...[Both of them knock on the wooden table]Erm...You wouldn't get the baby.
146	Amy	 Well, who would?
147	Ross	 Well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want Monica and Chandler.
148	Chandler	 I can't believe you want us to raise Emma!
149	Monica	 Yeah, Oh my god..I'm so moved.
150	Amy	 I don't believe this. Hold on a second. You guys die...and I don't get your baby???
151	Rachel	 Amy, see, we're alot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them everyday, and truthfully, honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
152	Amy	 Connected? I mean...To what? She's a lump!
153	Chandler	 You know guys, I gotta say this, this means so much to me. That you'd trust me, with your child...I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own, and I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...that you two....that you two...
154	Amy	 This guy? Seriously? (Points at Chandler)
155		[Scene-Monica and Chandler's apartment, later on.]
156	Monica	 Ok...it's time for dinner! Erm...everyone, we're using our fancy china, and erm, it's very expensive...so pleaaase be careful.
157		[Ross takes up a plate and fiddles with it.]
158	Ross	 Whoa.....whoa......[Laughs, then almost drops the plate but catches it. His expression turns serious.] Whoa!
159	Monica	 Ok er...just to be clear, comedy with the plates, will not be well-received. [Monica pinches Ross' arm. Ross flinches.]
160		[They all settle down and begin to eat.]
161	Joey	 Hey!! How come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses? Do you not trust me with the fancy plate?
162	Monica	 No!!! Honey that's...that's a special plate! See, it's a game! Whoever gets that plate, wins!
163	Joey(appearing very proud)	 I can't believe I won! (Phoebe smiles at him)
164	Amy	 Y'know, this is such a slap in the face. I mean, I'm your sister, and you'd give your baby to these....strangers over me.
165	Rachel	 Monica, is Ross' sister.
166	Amy	 No....Ross' sister was really fat.
167	Monica	 That was me.
168	Amy	 er...No. She was this really dorky girl in High School, who used to follow Rachel around like a puppy...
169	Rachel	 Amy!! You've GOT to stop doing that.
170		[Amy picks up the fork and begins to violently cut her food. Grating sounds can be heard.]
171	Monica	 Ok...listen er...I know that you're having a little bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates! In fact I think, that, everyone, should erm...cut their food like this! (Proceeds to cut a turkey drumstick in mid-air over the plate) Now, see? This way you protect the plates, and let's face it. You have fun.
172	Amy	 Ok, how bout this. If you guys die, and the crazy plate lady dies...THEN do I get the baby.
173	Chandler	 No...if crazy plate lady...[catches himself in mid-sentence] If Monica dies...then...I would get Emma...right?
174	Rachel	 Well, actually....
175	Chandler	 Actually what?
176	Ross	 Er...it's just that in THAT case...then erm...Emma would go to my parents.
177	Chandler	 What??!
178	Amy	 Hurts doesn't it? (Chandler nods)
179	Joey	 Er... Who has to die for me to get her?
180		
181		[Scene-Half-way into the Thanksgiving meal.]
182	Chandler	 So, if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
183	Ross	 No, that's not what we are saying...
184	Joey	 Yeah! He's lying he looked down! (Phoebe nods in agreement)
185	Chandler	 What...what is wrong with me? Am I, am I incompetent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
186	Rachel	 Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent! It's just that, you're more the...y'know, fun parent.
187	Ross	 Yeah! And we wanna make sure that Emma also has someone like Monica, who's more of a disciplinarian...someone who can be firm, and strict.
188	Monica	 That's not how you see me is it?
189	Phoebe	 No, you're all about the fun. (Phoebe is cutting her food like Monica told everyone to)
190	Chandler	 Look, I may not know alot about babies, but you really think I'm not capable?
191	Ross	 No...you both are equally capable. It's just that you're strongest, when you're together.
192	Chandler	 Ok, so if we both had Emma, and I die [knocks fist on table] she'd have to give her up.
193	Ross	 Sure! Monica would have to give her up.
194	Joey	 I lie better than that right? (Phoebe gives Joey a "of course!" look)
195	Chandler	 So...so let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma, then my wife dies, then Emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me?
196	Phoebe(Clapping)	 THERE'S your movie! (Joey nods in agreement)
197	[Scene	 Outside the apartment. Chandler is sitting on the steps. Monica opens the door]
198	Monica	 Hey...there you are. You disappeared after dinner.
199	Chandler	 Oh, did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
200	Monica	 Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about! I mean it's not like they're so responsible. Emma as a product of a bottle of Murlo and a five-year-old condom.
201	Chandler	 Y'know but they're right. I'm not a strong father-figure and I never will be.
202	Monica	 No....You learn these things. You grow into it.
203	Chandler	 Yeah, but it's not who I am. Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid. And it's true! And, look, everybody knows it.
204	Monica	 I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad. At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
205	Chandler	 Oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, "Go to your room! You're grounded!"
206	Monica	 Can you hear me say you're grounded?
207	Chandler	 You said that to me last week.
208	Monica	 How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture!
209		[Scene-In Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting away from Rachel. Joey and Phoebe are setting the table for dessert.]
210	Joey	 Argh. The producer from Days Of Our Life left me a message on the machine asking why I wasn't at the parade! They say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet Santa! [Whining]
211	Phoebe	 It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and it doesn't invite alot of questions. You weren't at the parade, because you had a family emergency.
212	Joey	 Oh...I like that! Yeah! I wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
213	Phoebe	 Ooo...What happened?
214	Joey	 Er...My sister's raccoon came.....
215	Phoebe[cutting in]	 No! Nothing with the raccoon!!
216		[Monica and Chandler come in]
217	Monica	 Wha...wait what are you doing?
218	Joey	 Setting the table.
219	Phoebe	 I thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
220	Monica	 Oh..How nice! Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress
221	Ross	 Hey dude, you ok? Sorry bout before.
222	Chandler	 No, no that's ok. You're totally right I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But...you did hurt my feelings...so, I want you to know that if I die, you don't get Joey.
223		[Amy walks to the couch and sits next to Rachel]
224		[Makes a throaty sound twice. On the second time, Rachel looks annoyed.]
225	Amy	 In case you haven't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
226		[Rachel makes a long throaty sound, imitating Amy's]
227	Amy	 You know, this is...this is classic Rachel.
228	Rachel	 Oh yeah...yeah, right. Remember in high school, when I died, and didn't give you my baby?
229	Amy	 This, might be my one chance to have a child, Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focussing on my career...
230	Rachel [cutting in]	 What? What career???
231	Amy	 Erm...I'm a decorator?? [sarcastic]
232	Rachel	 You decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? Ok! I went to the Zoo yesterday...now I'm a koala bear!
233	Amy	 Why can't you ever be supportive?
234	Rachel	 Suppor...You wanna talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby!
235	Amy	 Oh yeah? Well, you didn't come to see me in the hospital when I was getting my lips done!
236	Rachel	 I did the FIRST time!
237		[Gets up from the couch and walks to the dining table]
238	Rachel	 And...and you know what? You wanna know why I'm not giving Emily to you?
239	Ross	 Emma.
240	Rachel	 OH! Whoose side are you on!/ I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way, you could handle the responsibility of a child.
241	Amy	 Well, how hard could it be? You do it.
242	Joey	 Ooooooooohoohooo.......[realizes it is the wrong time and looks away, at his shoes.]
243	Amy	 Do I know why you don't want me to have the baby? Because you don't want me to be happy! You have ALWAYS been jealous of me.
244	Rachel	 Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility? Your...Your inmaturity? Your total disregard for other people's feelings?
245	Amy	 Er...To name a few!
246		[Rachel looks exasperated]
247	Amy	 Y'know, you're just, you've always been like this. You just...you had to have everything and I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me...I mean do you even realize how much that hurt me?
248	Rachel	 Timmy was my boyfriend! And you made out with him!!
249	Amy	 Oh come on, that was twenty years ago, get over it.
250	Rachel	 Oh god! I cannot believe...i cannot believe that i invited you here today!
251	Amy	 Yeah, y'know what I cannot believe? That my so-called sister, gets a thirty percent discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail?
252	Rachel	 Hahah......Ahhahah...It's forty-five!
253	Amy	 You...bitch.
254		[Rachel looks proud of herself]
255	Amy	 You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby, and your...your small apartment.
256		[Ross on hearing this, throws a napkin angriliy on the table]
257	Amy	 Well, let me tell you something. Your baby? Isn't even that cute.
258		[An audible intake of breath from everyone. Joey's eyes widen.]
259	Ross	 Too far Amy. Too far.
260	Rachel	 You take that back.
261	Amy	 No!
262	Rachel	 Take it back!
263	Amy	 NO! What are you going to do? Make me?
264	Rachel	 Hey...man! I work out!
265	Amy	 So do I!
266	Rachel	 I do karates.
267	Amy	 I do Yoga.
268	Rachel	 Bring it on!
269		[Amy pushes Rachel]
270	Monica	 Put the plates back in the boxes! Put the plates back in the boxes!
271	Rachel	 Did you just push me?
272	Amy	 Uh yeah! I think I did.
273	Rachel	 Alright that's it!
274		[Rachel pushes Amy back]
275	Monica	 Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time!
276		[Rachel and Amy begin slapping each others hands.]
277	Rachel	 Crazy crazy crazy crazy! [She says this while messing up Amy's hair]
278		[They go back to slapping each others hands. Rachel grabs Amy's head under her armpit]
279	Phoebe	 Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
280	Joey	 What are you? Out of your mind? Let's toss some Jell-O on them!
281		[Amy spits on Rachel's hands]
282	Rachel	 Ew! Ew! Gross gross!
283		[Rachel stops Amy by holding onto her forehead. Amy's hands swing randomly infront, unable to reach Rachel. They back up to the table and Rachel accidentally pushes one of the plates, smashing it. Monica on seeing this, grows weak in the knees. Ross supports her. Chandler puts a box of plates on a chair]
284	Chandler	 Alright! That is it! This is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. Now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. Now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out...But they're very important to Monica...And I want you to apologize to her right now.
285	Amy	 I'm sorry.
286	Rachel	 Mon...I'm so sorry.
287	Chandler	 Ok...That's better. Now I want you to apologize to each other, and mean it.
288	Amy & Rachel	 Sorry.
289	Chandler(Whispering)	 By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
290	Ross	 Dude, well done! You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies, and Monica dies, you can totally take care of Emma.
291	Chandler	 Oh yeah? Well, thanks!
292	Ross	 So, so, now do I get Joey?
293	Chandler	 Ok...but you should know, he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
294		[Ross looks thoughtful, and walks off. Monica is seen sweeping up the plate]
295	Rachel	 Are you ok Mon?
296	Monica	 Uh huh. These things happen. I mean it's just a plate, it's not like somebody died.
297	Phoebe	 It's alright...you can mourn.
298	Monica (Through tears)	 Thank you! It was so beautiful!
299		[Gets up and passes the dustpan to Rachel]
300	Monica	 I'm going to go to Joey's and get pies.
301	Joey	 Actually, not pies, it's just pie.
302	Monica	 I don't care. Oh my god, I've lost the will to scold.
303	Rachel	 Look, Amy...I got a little out-of-control over there. Erm...and I'm sorry. You're my sister and erm...if it really means that much to you...
304	Amy	 So you're going to give me the baby?
305	Rachel	 No, I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
306	Amy	 You are not going to regret this!
307		[They embrace. Emma cries]
308	Rachel	 She needs changing...
309	Chandler	 Oh no no! I'll get her. I'm super-confident, totally responsible and fourth in line to raise Emma./ I'll be right there Emma! Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.
310		[The diaper bag's strap hooks onto the chair where the plates are and falls, breaking all the plates. Chandler looks around.]
311	Chandler	 Well, what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
312		[Ending credits]
313		[Scene-Chandler is frantically taping the box of broken plates over and over.]
314	Phoebe	 Hey. Does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
315	Chandler	 Nope.
316	Phoebe	 Broke em all huh?
317	Chandler	 Yup.
318	Phoebe	 You going to tell her?
319	Chandler	 Nope.
320		[Monica walks toward the dining table]
321	Chandler	 Hey! So, I'm gonna put the plates back. Y'know I think you're right...I don't think we should use these plates again for a long time.
322	Monica	 Like only if the Queen comes?
323	Chandler	 Maybe not even then!
324		[Joey comes in]
325	Joey	 Hey! I did it! I called my producer, I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Phoebs.
326	Phoebe	 No problem. Next week, stealing!
327		[Chandler walks off with the box of plates.]
328	Monica	 Bye plates!
329	Joey	 Oh...you told her you broke all the plates huh?
330		[Chandler stares at Joey, and walks back quickly, keeping his eyes locked on Joey]
331	Monica	 What?! Something happened with the plates?
332		[Joey's eyes widen]
333	Joey	 Er...(Looks down) Yeah...this er...raccoon came in and..er..[makes an action describing the path of the raccoon]
