2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.]
3	Gunther	 Here you go.
4	Rachel	 Thank you.
5	Gunther	 (In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you’d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
6	Mark	 (entering) Hi!
7	Rachel	 Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!
8	Mark	 Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say.
9	Rachel	 Oh, okay.
10	Mark	 I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But since you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now.
11		(Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)
12	Rachel	 Wow! Umm....
13		(She’s interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)
14	Gunther	 I dropped a cup.
15		Opening Credits
16	[Scene	 The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from their date.]
17	Pete	 ...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.
18	Monica	 Oh, this is so great.
19	Pete	 Yeah, it was.
20	Monica	 All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.
21		(She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)
22	Monica	 Hello, people who do not live here.
23	All	 Hi! Hello!
24	Monica	 I gave you a key for emergencies!
25	Phoebe	 We were out of Doritos.
26	Ross	 Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
27	Chandler	 Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
28	Monica	 He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!
29	Ross	 Still?!
30	Monica	 Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
31	Chandler	 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
32	Monica	 Two.
33	Chandler	 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
34	Joey	 (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)
35	Ross	 I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
36	Monica and Phoebe	 Oh.
37	Chandler	 Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
38	[Scene	 A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play he’s in.]
39	The Director	 Joe. How’s it going?
40	Joey	 Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.
41	Kate	 Hi.
42	Joey	 Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?
43	Kate	 Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
44	Joey	 Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.
45	Kate	 Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
46		(She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of coffee.)
47	Joey	 So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?
48	Kate	 Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
49	Joey	 Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
50	Kate	 Where do I know you from?
51	Joey	 Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
52	Kate	 No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
53	Joey	 Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.
54	Kate	 That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!!
55	Joey	 See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.
56	Kate	 Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
57	Joey	 Yeah, that was real.
58	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind them.]
59	Phoebe	 Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
60	Rachel	 I know.
61	Phoebe	 What, so what are you gonna tell him?
62	Rachel	 Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.
63	Phoebe	 Huh.
64		(Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)
65	Rachel	 I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
66	Phoebe	 Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
67	Rachel	 I don’t have any issues with my Father.
68	Phoebe	 Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.
69	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]
70	Joey	 I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.
71	Ross	 (entering) Hello.
72	Chandler and Joey	 Hey!
73	Ross	 So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
74	Joey	 Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
75	Ross	 Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
76	Chandler	 It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
77	Ross	 Then be supportive like a guy.
78	Chandler	 (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.
79	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.]
80	Ross	 Hi.
81	Rachel	 Hi!
82	Ross	 You ah, wanted to see me?
83	Rachel	 Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
84	Ross	 What?!
85	Rachel	 Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.
86	Ross	 What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
87	Rachel	 No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?
88	Ross	 Yes.
89	Rachel	 Yeah?
90	Ross	 Yes, I do.
91	Rachel	 Good.
92	Ross	 Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!
93	Rachel	 Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
94	Ross	 It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
95	Rachel	 Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.
96	Ross	 No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.
97	Rachel	 You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
98	Ross	 I’m just trying to help you, move on.
99	Rachel	 Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
100	Ross	 Petty...
101	Rachel	 Petty... (goes into her room)
102	Ross	 Petty...
103	Rachel	 Petty...
104	Ross	 Petty...
105	Rachel	 Small...
106	Ross	 Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)
107	Rachel	 You are so just doing this out of spite.
108	Ross	 Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
109	Rachel	 Huh?
110	Ross	 I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)
111	Rachel	 You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!
112	Ross	 Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
113	Rachel	 (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
114	Ross	 Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)
115	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]
116	Phoebe	 So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
117	Chandler	 And you’re our age. You’re our age.
118	Phoebe	 Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
119	Pete	 What like Pete Dakota?
120	Phoebe	 Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
121	Joey	 Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
122	Chandler	 That’s not a state Joe.
123	Joey	 Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
124	Pete	 I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.
125	All	 Okay.
126	Chandler	 You’re our age!
127	Pete	 (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?
128	Monica	 Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!
129	Phoebe	 Yeah, kinda.
130	[Scene	 The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]
131	Kate	 Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
132	Joey	 Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.
133	The Director	 Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.
134	Kate	 I have a question about this scene.
135	The Director	 Yes?
136	Kate	 Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.
137	The Director	 Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.
138	Joey	 Yeah.
139	Kate	 I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
140	Joey	 Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.
141	Kate	 It doesn’t say that in the script.
142	Joey	 It does in mine!
143	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]
144	Chandler	 I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?
145	Ross	 You bug me.
146		[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]
147	Chandler	 Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
148		Commercial Break
149	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring out the peephole.]
150	Chandler	 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
151	Ross	 I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
152	Chandler	 You didn’t just break up.
153	Ross	 Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
154	Chandler	 You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
155	Ross	 Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.
156	Chandler	 Okay.
157	Ross	 She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!
158	Chandler	 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
159	Ross	 Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
160	Chandler	 Stop what?!
161	Ross	 I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
162		(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing hold of the foosball table.)
163	Chandler	 No!! You can’t!!
164	Ross	 Look, they must be stopped!
165	Chandler	 I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!
166	Ross	 I need juice! People need juice!!
167	Chandler	 Look man!
168	Ross	 People need juice!
169	Chandler	 Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
170	Ross	 Juice, I need...
171	Chandler	 She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.
172	Ross	 Yeah, okay.
173	Chandler	 Okay.
174	Ross	 It’s just I miss her so much.
175	Chandler	 I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)
176	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.]
177	Mark	 Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
178	Rachel	 Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’
179		(She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesn’t react. He tries it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)
180	Rachel	 Y'know what?
181	Mark	 No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to.
182	Rachel	 I can’t do this.
183	Mark	 Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.
184	Rachel	 Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.
185	Mark	 Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
186	Rachel	 Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
187	Mark	 That’s okay.
188	Rachel	 You sure?
189	Mark	 Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
190	[Scene	 A Hospital Reception, Monica and Pete are there.]
191	Spokeswoman	 ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
192	Pete	 (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?
193	Monica	 Sure.
194	Pete	 Where are we?
195	Monica	 (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.
196	Pete	 Just tell me the truth.
197	Monica	 Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
198	Pete	 Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago?
199	Monica	 So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
200	Pete	 Oh, yeah. I know that.
201	Monica	 I so wanna be attracted to you.
202	Pete	 But you’re not. Okay, good.
203	Monica	 I’m sorry.
204	Pete	 Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘cause it’s not so bad.
205	Monica	 It’s not?
206	Pete	 I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
207	Monica	 Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.
208	Pete	 Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you wanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start to leave)
209	Spokeswoman	 And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
210	Pete	 (to Monica) One second.
211		(He takes the scissors, cuts the ribbon, shakes her hand, posses for the picture, and leaves.)
212	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in one of the black chairs, and turns to face the other one.]
213	Chandler	 I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)
214		(Joey enters.)
215	Chandler	 (to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
216	Joey	 Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
217	Chandler	 Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
218	Joey	 God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’
219	Chandler	 I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
220	Joey	 Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
221	Chandler	 I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.
222	Joey	 Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.
223	Chandler	 Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
224	Joey	 Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
225	[Scene	 The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.]
226	Kate	 Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
227	Joey	 Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.
228	The Director	 You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
229	Kate	 Well, that was ah...
230	Joey	 Better?
231	Kate	 Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night.
232	Joey	 Ah, Kate?
233	Kate	 Yeah?
234	Joey	 You ah, you forgot your shoes.
235	Kate	 (she giggles) I’m probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some more)
236	Joey	 Hey, listen you ah....
237	Kate	 Hmm?
238	Joey	 ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
239	Kate	 Umm.
240	The Director	 (leaning in) Kate?
241	Kate	 Yep.
242	The Director	 You ready to go?
243	Kate	 Yeah.
244	The Director	 (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)
245	Kate	 So umm, I’ll see you tomorrow, huh?
246	Joey	 Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
247	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting in the living room.]
248	Phoebe	 (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...
249	Chandler	 ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
250	Phoebe	 It isn’t?
251	Chandler	 No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.
252	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
253	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
254	Monica	 Hey, Rach, how was work?
255	Rachel	 Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
256	Monica	 By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
257	Rachel	 Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
258	Monica	 Something wrong?
259	Rachel	 (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)
260		Closing Credits
261	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the black chairs.]
262	Chandler	 So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
263	Phoebe	 Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
264	Chandler	 What about things that are already gold?
265	Phoebe	 Ahh, his work is done.
266	Chandler	 Okay, let’s play my game now.
267	Phoebe	 Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)
268		End
