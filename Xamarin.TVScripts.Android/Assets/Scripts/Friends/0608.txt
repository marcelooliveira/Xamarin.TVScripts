3	Joey	 Hey.
4	Chandler	 Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
5	Joey	 Sure, neighbor come on in.
6	Chandler	 So, is Janine around?
7	Joey	 Uh, no, she’s at dance class.
8	Chandler	 Can I check out what she did to my room?
9	Joey	 Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)
10	Chandler	 (The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’s spreading already.
11	Joey	 (Looking around the room.) It is???
12	Chandler	 (Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
13	Joey	 No.
14	Chandler	 (Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?
15	Joey	 No.
16	Chandler	 No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
17	Joey	 (With Big Eyes.) All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.
18	Chandler	 Yes talk to her. Be a man.
19	Joey	 I’m a man.
20	Chandler	 Defend yourself.
21	Joey	 (Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)
22	Monica	 Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
23	Chandler	 Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.
24		Opening Credits
25	[Scene	 Central Perk, The gangs all here. Monica is walking in.]
26	Monica	 Hey guys.
27	Chandler	 Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
28	Monica	 It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
29	Chandler	 Ohh, yeah.
30	Ross	 Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
31	Monica	 Yeah.
32	Ross	 The one that always stares at me when I come in?
33	Monica	 No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
34	Ross	 Still I could tell. She was into me. (Joey rolls his eyes.) Well, why don’t you set us up?
35	Rachel	 Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
36	Phoebe	 (Walking over and Sitting down.) Hey.
37	Rachel	 Hey.
38	Phoebe	 Rachel?
39	Rachel	 Yeah.
40	Phoebe	 I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
41	Rachel	 Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.
42	Phoebe	 Oh my God. What happened?
43	Rachel	 I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
44	Phoebe	 Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)
45	Rachel	 Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..
46	Phoebe	 (Hugging her again.) You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
47	Rachel	 But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.
48	Chandler	 That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
49	Monica	 I don’t think mine likes me either.
50	Ross	 Maybe it’s a universal thing?
51	Joey	 Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11
52	Chandler	 Yeah let’s head off to work.
53	Monica	 We should go.
54	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Phoebe hands Rachel a key card.]
55	Phoebe	 Thank you.
56	Rachel	 Sure.
57	Phoebe	 Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
58	Rachel	 Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
59	Phoebe	 Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
60	Rachel	 What? What!?! You kissed him?
61	Phoebe	 Totally.
62	Rachel	 (Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?
63	Phoebe	 Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.
64	Rachel	 Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?
65	Phoebe	 No!
66	Rachel	 Phoebe…
67	Phoebe	 What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? (Rachel looks at her.) No, yeah, I should.
68	[Scene	 Joey and Janine’s apartment, Joey stares at a picture of a bay on the wall. Janine comes out of her room.]
69	Janine	 Hey Joey.
70	Joey	 Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
71	Janine	 No, I just thought it was cute.
72	Joey	 Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.
73	Janine	 Ohh. Like what?
74	Joey	 Like this. (pointing to the picture) Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.
75	Janine	 Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.
76	Joey	 Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.
77	Janine	 Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer.
78	Joey	 Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
79	Janine	 Well I just thought…
80	Joey	 I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
81	Janine	 It’s a curling iron.
82	Joey	 Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.
83	Janine	 It’s clean.
84	Joey	 Yeah, well, it feels different.
85	Janine	 It’s dry.
86	Joey	 Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?
87	Janine	 No no no no, it’s potpourri. You’re supposed to smell it. (Joey takes a big whiff of the potpourri.)
88	Joey	 (Voice cracking) Well that’s like summer in a bowl.

102	Chandler	 You know…Oh My God.
103	Monica	 What happened to your teeth.
104	Ross	 I whitened them.
105	Chandler	 (Sarcastically) Really.
106	Ross	 Yeah. What do you think.
107	Monica	 Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
108	Ross	 Come on, seriously.
109	Monica	 Ross they’re really, really, really white.
110	Chandler	 Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
111	Ross	 Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
112	Monica	 How much longer?
113	Ross	 A-A day.
114	Monica	 Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
115	Ross	 I know. That’s why I did it. (With a big smile) Come on, are they really that bad?
116	Chandler	 No, no no no. You’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillary’s bind, right?
117	Monica	 She will be after tonight.

120	Rachel	 Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
121	Chandler	 What???
122	Monica	 Oh my god.
123	Rachel	 Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
124	Chandler	 I am proud of all my friends today.
125	Monica	 My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)
126	Chandler	 Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy
127	Monica	 Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)
128	Chandler	 Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
129	Phoebe	 Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of Ralph.) Ohh, who’s the silver fox?
130	Rachel	 That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? (Holding up the magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
131	Phoebe	 That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
132	Rachel	 What?
133	Phoebe	 Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
134	Rachel	 Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.
135	Phoebe	 What?
136	Rachel	 Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
137	Phoebe	 Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
138	Rachel	 To get you to make out with him!!!
139	Phoebe	 Ohhh.
140	[Scene	 Ross’s Apartment, Ross and Monica are there.]
141	Monica	 (Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
142	Ross	 I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
143	Monica	 Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.
144	Ross	 Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
145	Monica	 I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
146	Ross	 Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.
147	Monica	 Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
148	Ross	 But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?
149	Monica	 Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
150	Ross	 What??
151	Monica	 All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
152	Ross	 No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)
153	Phoebe	 Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
154	[Scene	 Chandler’s and Monica’s apartment, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen table making potpourri sachets.]
155	Monica	 Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.
156	Chandler	 Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
157	Monica	 Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
158	Chandler	 Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
159	Monica	 You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.
160	Chandler	 Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
161	Monica	 Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
162	Chandler	 You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
163	Monica	 When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. (Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.
164	[Scene	 Joey and Janine’s apartment, Chandler walks in. Joey and Janine are knitting at the kitchen counter.]
165	Joey	 Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.
166	Chandler	 No thanks, Josephine.
167	[Scene	 Ross’s apartment, Chandler enters. Ross is putting on makeup.]
168	Chandler	 Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
169	[Scene	 Elevator at the Ralph Lauren offices, Kim’s waiting for it. The door opens and Rachel is inside.]
170	Rachel	 Ohh, hi, Kim.
171	Kim	 Hi Rachel.
172	Rachel	 Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.
173	Kim	 You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
174	Rachel	 Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.
175	Kim	 That’s not true?
176	Rachel	 No.
177	Kim	 Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
178	Rachel	 Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
179	Kim	 Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
180	Rachel	 I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)
181	Kim	 Hi Ralph.
182	Ralph Lauren	
183	Kim	 Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
184	[Scene	 Hillary’s apartmen,. Hillary and Ross are having dinner. He is avoiding opening his mouth.]
185	Hillary	 And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
186	Ross	 Mmm-Hmm.
187	Hillary	 And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
188	Ross	 Mmm.
189	Hillary	 You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
190	Ross	 Mm-Hmm.
191	Hillary	 After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?
192	Ross	 (Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.
193	Hillary	 I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?
194	Ross	 Mmm-Unmm.
195	Hillary	 Come on. I want to know.
196	Ross	 Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
197	[Scene	 Joey and Janine’s apartment, Joey and Monica are arranging flowers. Chandler walks in.]
198	Joey	 So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
199	Monica	 Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
200	Chandler	 Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
201	Monica	 Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
202	Joey	 Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)
203	Chandler	 What is the matter with you ?!?
204	Joey	 What?
205	Chandler	 You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
206	Joey	 Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
207	Chandler	 You’re turning into a women.
208	Joey	 No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
209	Chandler	 Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
210	Joey	 It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!
211	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there.]
212	Rachel	 Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
213	Phoebe	 But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
214	Rachel	 I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
215	Phoebe	 Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
216	Rachel	 You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?
217	Phoebe	 Just for a second.
218	Rachel	 Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
219	Phoebe	 Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
220	Rachel	 I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.
221	Phoebe	 Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
222	Rachel	 That wouldn’t help me.
223	Phoebe	 Ohh, yes it would.
224	[Scene	 Hillary’s apartment, Hillary and Ross are finishing up their date.]
225	Hillary	 I’ve had a really good time tonight.
226	Ross	 Mmm.
227	Hillary	 You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
228	Ross	 (Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)
229	Hillary	 Are you going to eat that bread?
230	Ross	 (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.) Mmmm.
231	Hillary	 (Laughing) You make me laugh.
232	Ross	 Hmm-Hmm.
233	Hillary	 Would you like to move over to the couch?
234	Ross	 Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)
235	Hillary	 Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.
236	Ross	 (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.
237	Hillary	 Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has some black light posters on the wall.)
238	Ross	 (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So, ahh, where were we?
239	Hillary	 Are those your teeth??
240	Ross	 Ohh, you can see them, huh?
241	Hillary	 Yes. They’re insanely white.
242	Ross	 I-I, did that for you.
243	Hillary	 What’s a matter with you?
244	Ross	 What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
245	[Scene	 Elevator at the Ralph Lauren Offices, Rachel gets in . Kim is there.]
246	Rachel	 Kim, hi.
247	Kim	 Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
248	Rachel	 Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
249	Kim	 Oh, really?
250	Rachel	 (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
251	Kim	 You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph.
252	Ralph Lauren	
253	Kim	 Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.
254	Rachel	 Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.
255	Kim	 Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there.
256	Rachel	 You and Ralph?
257	Kim	 Kenny the copyboy.

263	Joey	 I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.
264	Janine	 Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.
265	Joey	 Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
266	Janine	 Okay.
