2	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there as Chandler and Monica enter. Oh, and Joey is wearing a FDNY T-shirt to make this the first nod to the tragedy that Friends have made.]
3	Monica	 Hey you guys?
4	Ross	 What?
5	Monica	 I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
6	Phoebe	 Oh good! (And there’s general excitement.)
7	Monica	 And everybody has to wear costumes. (And there’s general disconcertment.) Come on! It’ll be fun!
8	Ross	 Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
9	Rachel	 Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
10	Ross	 (exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
11	Joey	 Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up.
12	Monica	 You have to!
13	Joey	 No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…
14	Chandler	 You’re an actor!
15	Monica	 So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
16	Ross	 Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
17	Joey	 That hot girl from their wedding?
18	Ross	 Yeah.
19	Joey	 Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
20	Phoebe	 Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
21	Ross	 That’s right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don’t take her from me.
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 A Street, Phoebe is walking down it and passes Ursula.]
24	Phoebe	 Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe!
25	Ursula	 Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye. (Starts to walk again.)
26	Phoebe	 Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?
27	Ursula	 Umm, nothing. I mean, I’m getting married next week.
28	Phoebe	 What?!
29	Ursula	 Yeah! Yeah, it’s gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. (Phoebe looks at her.) His.
30	Phoebe	 Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)
31	Ursula	 Wait! If umm, if you want to come, I guess that’d be okay.
32	Phoebe	 Really?
33	Ursula	 Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
34	Phoebe	 Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.
35	Ursula	 Huh. Well, I’m supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I’m supposed to be working right now, so who cares.
36	Phoebe	 By the way, it’s a costume party.
37	Ursula	 Oh! Okay, so that’s why you’re… (Motions to what she’s wearing.)
38	Phoebe	 (looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)
39	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, The Halloween party has started. Monica is setting out some food as Rachel enters.]
40	Rachel	 Hi!
41	Monica	 Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!
42	Rachel	 I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.
43	Monica	 Oh.
44	Rachel	 Ahh!
45	Monica	 I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it.
46	Rachel	 Okay.
47		(There’s a knock on the door.)
48	Kids	 Trick or treat!
49	Rachel	 Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
50	Kids	 Trick or treat!!
51	Rachel	 (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)
52	Witch	 Thank you.
53	Rachel	 And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
54	Clown	 Thank you.
55	Rachel	 (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but…
56	Cowgirl	 (interrupting) Can I just have the candy?
57	Rachel	 Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe, dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
58	Phoebe	 Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
59	Monica	 So we do Supergirl.
60	Phoebe	 No, it’s me. Phoebe!
61	Chandler	 (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume…
62	Rachel	 (To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?
63	Monica	 What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
64	Chandler	 The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
65	Monica	 Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
66	Chandler	 No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
67	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
68	Monica	 You didn’t dress up either?!
69	Joey	 Yes I did! I’m Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?
70	Chandler	 How is that me?
71	Joey	 Okay. I’m Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)
72	Phoebe	 (To Chandler) That is so you!
73	Chandler	 When have I ever done that?!
74	Joey	 When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)
75		(There’s a knock on the door.)
76	Girl	 Trick or treat!
77	Rachel	 Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.
78	Ballerina	 Thank you. (Pirouettes.)
79	Rachel	 Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
80	Ballerina	 Thank you. (Does another ballerina move.)
81	Rachel	 Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
82	Ballerina	 I love you! (Hugs Rachel.)
83	Rachel	 Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?
84	Monica	 What?! There’s only been like four kids.
85	Rachel	 Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
86	Phoebe	 No wonder your pregnant.
87	Ross	 (entering) Hey! (He’s wearing a costume as well.)
88	Rachel	 Hey.
89	Monica	 What are you supposed to be?
90	Ross	 Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes… (They’re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!
91	Chandler	 Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!
92	Joey	 (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
93	Ross	 No, I-I’m not doody.
94	Monica	 No, space doody!
95		(Joey gives him the okay symbol, and Ross rushes towards him to be stopped by Chandler. Meanwhile, Phoebe goes over to the snack table as some guy, which turns out to be Ursula's fianc�e Eric, walks in and smacks her butt.)
96	Eric	 Aren’t you gonna give me a kiss?
97	Phoebe	 Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
98	Eric	 Ursula?
99	Phoebe	 Ursula’s fianc�e?
100	Eric	 Oh my God, you’re the sister!
101	Phoebe	 Yeah.
102	Eric	 Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law’s ass.
103	Phoebe	 Yeah.
104	Eric	 I’m an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.
105	Phoebe	 My mother killed herself.
106	Eric	 She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, "Look at me," I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
107	Phoebe	 No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.
108	Eric	 Eric. (They shake hands and he’s squinting. And, no, it’s not me.)
109	Phoebe	 Why are you looking at me like that?
110	Eric	 ‘Cause the sweat’s getting in my eyes and its burning.
111	Phoebe	 Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?
112	Eric	 I don’t think they have a name for it. It’s just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.
113	Phoebe	 (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
114	Eric	 Oh umm, I’m the solar system. (He’s wearing a black sweater with the planets glued on around the sun.) Yeah, my students helped me make it—I teach the second grade.
115	Phoebe	 I love the second grade!
116	Eric	 Really?
117	Phoebe	 Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.
118	Eric	 So what do you do?
119	Phoebe	 Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)
120	Eric	 Y’know you don’t have to stand here with me, believe me…
121	Phoebe	 No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.
122	Eric	 Oh I feel very lucky, she’s great. I think she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.
123	Phoebe	 Thank you.
124		[Time lapse, Monica is going over to talk to Joey.]
125	Monica	 Hey Joey?
126	Joey	 Yeah.
127	Monica	 You read comic books right?
128	Joey	 Exclusively.
129	Monica	 Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
130	Joey	 Catwoman, hands down.
131	Monica	 Yeah…
132	Joey	 But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.
133	Monica	 What?! Really?!
134	Joey	 Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?
135	Monica	 No you’re fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
136	Joey	 I’m not sure.
137	Monica	 What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!
138	Joey	 Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.
139	Monica	 Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
140	Joey	 I would say, "Woman, please!"
141	Phoebe	 (walking over) Hey. Ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
142	Monica	 Oh my God, Phoebe!
143	Phoebe	 What?
144	Monica	 You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fianc�e.
145	Phoebe	 No I’m not! You are!
146	Joey	 (To Monica) Here comes the temper.
147		(There’s a knock on the door and Rachel opens it to a little girl.)
148	Girl	 Trick or treat!
149	Rachel	 Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?
150	Girl	 Okay!
151	Rachel	 Okay, what’s your name?
152	Girl	 Lelani Mayolanofavich.
153	Rachel	 Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash.
154	Mona	 (entering) Hi!
155	Rachel	 Hey Mona!
156	Chandler	 Oh! Hi!
157	Mona	 Hi!
158	Chandler	 Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.
159	Mona	 Umm, actually I’m just a nurse.
160	Chandler	 You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed out.
161	Ross	 Hey!
162	Mona	 Hi!
163	Ross	 You made it!
164	Mona	 Wait-wait! You’re umm, you’re a potato…
165	Ross	 Well, I’m a spud…
166	Mona	 And the antennae…Oh my God you’re Spudnik!
167	Ross	 Yes!
168	Chandler	 (To Ross) Marry her.
169		[Cut to Joey and Monica.]
170	Joey	 Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
171	Monica	 I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.
172	Joey	 So Ross?
173	Monica	 Yeah.
174		[Cut to Phoebe and Eric.]
175	Eric	 Hey beautiful.
176	Phoebe	 Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
177	Eric	 Two weeks ago.
178	Phoebe	 Two weeks? That’s it?
179	Eric	 Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it’s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she’s just so perfect, and we have so much in common.
180	Phoebe	 Oh really?
181	Eric	 We’re both teachers.
182	Phoebe	 Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
183	Eric	 And we were both in the Peace Corps.
184	Phoebe	 Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, "I don’t know.")
185	Eric	 In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
186	Ursula	 Yeah. It wasn’t a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. (To Eric) Shall we get me really drunk?
187	Eric	 Sure.
188		(They walk away.)
189		[Cut to Mona and Ross walking past Chandler.]
190	Chandler	 Howdy doody.
191	Ross	 That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
192	Chandler	 Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.
193	Joey	 (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
194	Chandler	 What question?
195	Joey	 Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
196	Chandler	 There’s no question.
197	Joey	 So you think Ross too?
198		(Monica turns around slowly.)
199	Chandler	 (To Monica) You picked Ross?!
200	Monica	 Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.
201	Chandler	 I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
202	Ross	 Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
203	Chandler	 Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
204	Ross	 Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
205		(They start to fight with Ross pulling on Chandler’s ears and Chandler hitting Ross over the head with his carrot.)
206	Monica	 Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.
207	Joey	 Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!
208	Mona	 Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
209	Joey	 Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
210	Chandler	 (To Ross) You’re going down.
211	Ross	 Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
212	Joey	 Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
213		Commercial Break
214	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, the party continues with Rachel leaning on the counter as Gunther walks in carrying candy.]
215	Rachel	 Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
216	Gunther	 Really?
217	Rachel	 Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
218		(There’s a knock on the door.)
219	Kid	 Trick or treat!
220	Rachel	 Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go! (Hands him some candy.)
221	Boy in the Cape	 My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
222	Rachel	 Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy.
223	Boy in the Cape	 I’d rather have the money.
224	Rachel	 Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!
225	Boy in the Cape	 This isn’t fair.
226	Rachel	 Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
227	Boy in the Cape	 Shut up!
228	Rachel	 You shut up!
229		(The gang gets interested now.)
230	Boy in the Cape	 You can’t tell me to shut up!
231	Rachel	 Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
232	Joey	 Rach?
233	Rachel	 (To Joey) Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!
234	Boy in the Cape	 You’re a mean old woman. (Runs away.)
235	Rachel	 No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
236		[Cut to Mona and Joey clearing the dining room table for the grudge match between Chandler and Ross.]
237	Monica	 (To Chandler) Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
238	Chandler	 That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
239	[Scene	 The Hallway, Phoebe is exiting Monica and Chandler’s, and finds Ursula standing in the hallway smoking.]
240	Phoebe	 Hi liar!
241	Ursula	 Hey!
242	Phoebe	 Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
243	Ursula	 Well they could be true.
244	Phoebe	 But they’re not!
245	Ursula	 Yeah, it’s a fine line huh?
246	Phoebe	 Why are you lying to him?
247	Ursula	 I don’t know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
248	Eric	 (entering) Honey?
249	Ursula	 (waving the cigarette in Phoebe’s face) It’s a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
250	Eric	 She’s helped so many people to quit smoking.
251	Ursula	 Y’know, we’d really better get going.
252	Eric	 Oh right, you’ve got a church group meeting tonight.
253	Ursula	 Right. (Walks down the stairs.)
254	Eric	 (To Phoebe) Well, it was nice meeting you.
255	Phoebe	 You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
256	Joey	 (entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each other’s hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
257	Ross	 Pride.
258	Chandler	 And dignity.
259	Joey	 (laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
260		(They start wrestling, only they are unable to move either one’s arm despite a huge strain on their faces and a cheering crowd.)
261	[Time Lapse	 the crowd has left and only Mona, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are still watching to see who will be able to move the other’s arm first. An event that has yet to happen.]
262	Mona	 (To Joey) Wow! They’re both really strong.
263	Joey	 Or equally weak.
264	Monica	 (To Phoebe) Oh God!
265	Phoebe	 Hmm?
266	Monica	 Chandler’s making his sex face.
267		(Basically Chandler’s face looks like he’s not all there and is staring off into the distance…)
268	Ross	 (To Chandler) So, you gettin’ tired?
269	Chandler	 Nope! I can do this all day.
270	Ross	 Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin’ a little tired though.
271	Chandler	 God, I’m exhausted.
272	Ross	 Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
273	Chandler	 No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!
274	Ross	 Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.
275	Chandler	 You’re Spudnik.
276	Ross	 Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.
277	Chandler	 Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
278	Ross	 (celebrating) Oh yeah!
279	Mona	 (clapping) Yay! My hero!
280	Joey	 (to her) You’re a weird lady.
281	Eric	 (entering) Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
282	Phoebe	 Oh.
283	Eric	 (finds it) What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
284	Phoebe	 Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
285	Eric	 Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding. (Exits and Phoebe follows him into the hall.)
286	Phoebe	 Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
287	Eric	 I think we’ll be okay. Besides it’s so perfect and (whispering) she’s been saving herself for me.
288	Phoebe	 Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.
289	Eric	 What?
290	Phoebe	 She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs Ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
291	Eric	 She told me she was 25.
292	Phoebe	 Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember I’m a minute younger.
293	Eric	 I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher. There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
294	Phoebe	 No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.
295	Eric	 I’m not smart. (Phoebe has no comeback.) I just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. To be romantic.
296	Phoebe	 That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?
297	Eric	 It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
298	Ursula	 (yelling from downstairs) Eric!! Let’s go!!
299	Eric	 I’d better go, deal…
300	Phoebe	 Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)
301	Ursula	 Hurry up I gotta pray!!
302		(Phoebe hands Eric Ursula’s purse and he walks away.)
303	[Time Lapse	 Rachel is returning from chasing down the boy in the cape.]
304	Joey	 Hey!
305	Rachel	 Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
306	Joey	 That’s not so bad.
307	Rachel	 No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
308	Joey	 Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
309	Rachel	 Really? You think that’s all it is?
310	Joey	 Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)
311		Closing Credits
312	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Monica are standing in the kitchen.]
313	Monica	 Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.
314	Chandler	 Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
315	Monica	 (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
316	Chandler	 No, I let him win—Ross!
317	Ross	 Yeah?
318	Chandler	 Would you tell her I let you win please?
319	Ross	 Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)
320	Chandler	 I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)
321	Monica	 Chandler please!
322	Chandler	 Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
323	Monica	 Let’s go big bunny!
324		(They assume the starting position.)
325	Chandler	 Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate, but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!
326		End
