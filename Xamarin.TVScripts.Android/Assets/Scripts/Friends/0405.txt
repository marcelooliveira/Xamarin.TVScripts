2	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang's all there. Ross has a slip of paper that he throws on the ground tying to get Rachel's attention.]
3	Ross	 (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)
4	Phoebe	 Thank you.

11	Gunther	 Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
12	Ross	 Oh, mine's December...
13	Gunther	 Yeah, whatever. (Walks away)

15	Chandler	 Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
16	Monica	 Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
17	Chandler	 I could die.
18	Ross	 Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
19	Rachel	 Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
20		(Ross glares at Chandler.)
21	Chandler	 I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
22	Phoebe	 (entering) Oh.
23	Chandler	 Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
24	Monica	 Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
25	Phoebe	 (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)
26	Chandler	 All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
27	Monica	 Just be yourself. But, not too much.
28	Chandler	 (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
29	Ross	 (loudly) Good luck!
30	Chandler	 Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
31	Kathy	 No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
32	Chandler	 Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
33	Kathy	 With a K.
34	Chandler	 Oh-oh-hey!
35	Kathy	 Wow! You are really good at this.
36	Chandler	 Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
37	Kathy	 I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. (Joey enters) Oh, and there he is now.
38	Joey	 Hey!
39	Chandler	 Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)
40	Joey	 Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
41	Chandler	 Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
42	Joey	 Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
43	Phoebe	 Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
44	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is walking into the living room having just gotten up in the middle of the night.]
45	Chandler	 (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!
46	Kathy	 Hi.
47	Chandler	 Jeez, at 2
48	Kathy	 I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
49	Chandler	 Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
50	Kathy	 You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
51	Chandler	 Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
52	Kathy	 Oh please!
53	Chandler	 So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
54	Kathy	 Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
55	Chandler	 That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
56	Kathy	 (laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!
57	Chandler	 Is it on?
58	Kathy	 No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
59	Chandler	 Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
60	Kathy	 Oh my God!
61	Chandler	 Oh! It's on! It's on!
62		(Chandler jumps into the canoe and sits down. The chick starts chirping and Chandler reaches down to pick him up.)
63	Chandler	 There we go little fella.
64	Kathy	 (laughs) What about the duck?
65	Chandler	 Well the duck can swim.
66	Kathy	 Oh, jeez. (Hits him)
67	[Scene	 Central Perk, the next night, Phoebe is finishing up her set.]
68	Phoebe	 (singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
69	All	 Way to go, Phoebe!
70	Monica	 That cold makes you sound so great.
71	Phoebe	 It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)
72	Joey	 Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
73	All	 Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
74	Kathy	 No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
75	Rachel	 Well, have fun!
76	Kathy	 Okay.
77	Phoebe	 Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
78	Monica	 Y'know what, I like Kathy.
79	Chandler	 Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
80	Rachel	 Yeah, she's...
81	Chandler	 She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
82	Rachel	 You love her.
83	Chandler	 No, I don't.
84	Phoebe	 Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
85	Ross	 Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
86	Chandler	 Thank you, Ross.
87	Ross	 Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
88	Chandler	 All right.
89	All	 Ohh!
90	Chandler	 All right.
91	Monica	 (turning around and doing that, "I'm making out with someone," thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)
92	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are there.]
93	Phoebe	 So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
94	Monica	 Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
95	Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
96	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
97	Monica	 Hey!
98	Phoebe	 Hey.
99	Ross	 (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
100	Monica	 Rachel's not here.
101	Ross	 Oh.
102	Monica	 How's it going with her?
103	Ross	 Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
104	Rachel	 (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
105	Monica	 Hi, Josh.
106	Phoebe	 Hi.
107	Josh	 Dudes.
108	Monica	 So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)
109	Josh	 Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
110	Rachel	 Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
111	Josh	 Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
112	Rachel	 Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.
113	Josh	 Dope! (exits)
114	Phoebe	 Wow, cute one!
115	Monica	 Very!
116	Rachel	 I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
117	Ross	 Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
118	Rachel	 Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
119	Ross	 Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
120	Rachel	 What was that?
121	Ross	 Monica knows.
122	Monica	 It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
123	Ross	 Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
124	Phoebe	 Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
125	[Scene	 Amanda's apartment, Ross is arriving with Ben.]
126	Amanda	 (opening the door) Hi!
127	Ross	 Hi!
128	Amanda	 Hi Ben!
129	Ross	 Wow! You-you look great!
130	Amanda	 Thanks!
131	Ross	 (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.
132	Amanda	 I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
133	Ross	 Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
134	Amanda	 Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
135	Ross	 What?
136	Amanda	 I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
137	Ross	 I-I-I...
138	Amanda	 (noticing the bottle of wine he has) Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)
139	Ross	 Who wants to make some long distance calls?
140	[Scene	 A street, Chandler is buying a newspaper and notices Kathy running by.]
141	Chandler	 Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.
142	Kathy	 Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
143	Chandler	 Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
144	Kathy	 Hey!
145	Chandler	 Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
146		Commercial Break
147	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is telling Monica about his new baby sitting job.]
148	Monica	 Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
149	Ross	 Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
150		(Phoebe runs into the kitchen with wet hair, opens the window, and sticks her head outside.)
151	Ross	 Pheebs, what are you doing?
152	Phoebe	 Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
153	Monica	 Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
154	Chandler	 (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
155	Phoebe	 What?!
156	Ross	 Are you serious?
157	Phoebe	 Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
158	Chandler	 I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
159	Monica	 (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
160	Phoebe	 You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
161		(Joey and Kathy enter, laughing)
162	Joey	 Hey.
163	Kathy	 (to Chandler) We were just talking about you.
164	Chandler	 Really?!
165	Joey	 Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
166	Chandler	 (laughs) Right in there!
167	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with the chick and the duck.]
168	Chandler	 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
169	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
170	Chandler	 Hey!
171	Joey	 Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
172	Chandler	 Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
173	Joey	 It's 4
174	Chandler	 Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
175	Joey	 Okay, I see what's going on here.
176	Chandler	 You-you do?
177	Joey	 Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
178	Chandler	 You got me.
179	Joey	 Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
180	Chandler	 Yeah. Right.
181	Joey	 Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
182	Chandler	 Okay.
183	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from a date with Josh, and when they get the door open, Rachel turns and passionately kisses Josh.]
184	Monica	 (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
185	Rachel	 Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!
186	Josh	 So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
187	Rachel	 Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!
188	Monica	 What?
189	Rachel	 I think he's stealing from me.
190	Monica	 Why?
191	Rachel	 Because he's stealing from me!
192	Phoebe	 (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
193	Rachel	 Ughh! (Storms out after him)
194	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
195	Monica	 Thank you so much Phoebe.
196	Phoebe	 (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
197	Monica	 What are you doing with those?!
198	Phoebe	 But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
199	Monica	 Sorry, Phoebe.
200	Phoebe	 It's okay. How's the soup?
201	Monica	 Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")
202		(Monica sets the soup down and Phoebe picks it up and licks the rim.)
203	Monica	 Ohhhh!! Gross!!
204	[Scene	 A nightclub, Chandler is having dinner with Kathy and Joey.]
205	Kathy	 Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
206	Joey	 Is she great or what?
207	Kathy	 (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?
208	Chandler	 Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
209	Kathy	 Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
210	Chandler	 Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
211	Kathy	 Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
212	Chandler	 Uhh, no-no thanks.
213	Kathy	 Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
214	Chandler	 Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
215	Joey	 (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
216	Chandler	 What?
217	Joey	 Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
218	Chandler	 Hey, look, what do you want from me?
219	Joey	 I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
220	Chandler	 I am pretending.
221	Joey	 Well then, do it better!
222	Chandler	 Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
223	Joey	 Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
224	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]
225	Ross	 (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
226	Monica	 No, sorry.
227	Rachel	 Well where's Amanda?
228	Monica	 Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
229	Rachel	 I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
230	Monica	 Ross, cough drops, please?
231	Ross	 At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
232	Rachel	 Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
233	Ross	 You see Amanda and I have a very special...
234	Monica	 (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
235	Rachel	 (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.
236	Monica	 And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
237		(Ross starts laughing)
238	Rachel	 Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)
239	Monica	 That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
240	Ross	 Fine.
241	Rachel	 Sorry.
242	Ross	 Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
243	Rachel	 Y'know...
244		(She does Ross's little gesture. In response Ross puts his hands behind his neck with his arms sticking straight out and starts flapping them together.)
245	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there with her guitar.]
246	Phoebe	 (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?
247	Gunther	 I like it. (sneezes)
248	Phoebe	 Gunther, kiss me.
249	Gunther	 What?
250		(Phoebe grabs Gunther and kisses him. He then falls to the couch in shock.)
251	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV as Joey and Kathy are laughing in Joey's bedroom. They get to be pretty loud so Chandler turns the TV way up.]
252	Joey	 (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
253	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, with a blanket draped over her shoulders, opens the door to a similarly clad Chandler.]
254	Chandler	 Can I sleep on your couch?
255		(Monica nods `Yes.' And they both walk to the couch looking all depressed.)
256		Closing Credits
257	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is singing, with everyone else present.]
258	Phoebe	 (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
259		(applause)
260	Gunther	 Rachel?
261	Rachel	 Yeah.
262	Gunther	 I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
263	Rachel	 No!
264	Gunther	 Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
265	Rachel	 (confused) Okay.
266	Gunther	 So umm, are we cool?
267	Rachel	 (really confused) Okay.
268	Gunther	 I knew you'd understand.
269		(Gunther walks away, leaving Rachel with a `What just happened?' look on her face.)
