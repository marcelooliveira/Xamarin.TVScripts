2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel has just gotten home and is going through the mail. She finds something that's Monica's and goes over and knocks on her closed bedroom door.]
3	Monica	 (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.
4		(Rachel enters.)
5	Rachel	 Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in horror.) Oh my God!
6	Monica	 (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
7	Rachel	 Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
8	Monica	 Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
9	Rachel	 (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
10	Monica	 Uh-huh, that one!
11	Rachel	 Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)
12	Monica	 (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm… (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.
13	Rachel	 Why aren't you guys at the movie?
14	Joey	 Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
15	Ross	 I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
16	Joey	 (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
17	Monica	 But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
18	Joey	 Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
19	Ross	 (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
20	Joey	 Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
21	Chandler	 (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross, and Monica are eating breakfast.]
24	Joey	 (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!
25	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
26	Joey	 Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
27	Monica	 Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?
28	Joey	 Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
29	Monica	 Oh that's great!
30	Joey	 A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
31	Phoebe	 Ugh, PBS!
32	Monica	 What's wrong with PBS?
33	Phoebe	 Ugh, what's right with them?
34	Joey	 Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?
35	Phoebe	 Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
36	Chandler	 Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
37	Phoebe	 All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
38	Joey	 I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
39	Phoebe	 This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
40	Joey	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
41	Phoebe	 What-what are you talking about?!
42	Joey	 Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
43	Phoebe	 Yeah. So?
44	Joey	 It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
45	Phoebe	 Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
46	Joey	 Well, may I ask for one example?
47	Phoebe	 Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!
48		(They are standing on either side of Chandler as they discuss the point. Chandler, meanwhile, is disgusted with the whole argument.)
49	Joey	 That's because all people are selfish.
50	Phoebe	 Are you calling me selfish?!
51	Joey	 Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
52	Phoebe	 I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
53		(Ross's phone rings and he answers it.)
54	Ross	 (on phone) Hello.
55	Emily	 (on phone from London) Hello, Ross?
56	Ross	 Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily) Hi!
57	Emily	 Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
58	Ross	 No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
59	Emily	 Really? About what?
60	Ross	 Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
61	Emily	 I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
62	Ross	 (to the gang, whispering) She's talking.
63	All	 (subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who is still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in private.)
64	Phoebe	 Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
65	Joey	 That he doesn't exist.
66	Phoebe	 Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
67	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there.]
68	Rachel	 So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
69	Chandler	 Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
70	Rachel	 So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
71	Monica	 Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
72	Chandler	 Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
73	Rachel	 I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
74		(Chandler is quite pleased with that statement.)
75	Chandler	 Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
76	Monica	 I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?
77	Chandler	 Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky dog!
78	Ross	 (entering) Hi!
79	Monica	 Hey!
80	Ross	 Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
81	Chandler	 Yes!
82	Monica	 That's great!
83	Ross	 In London!
84	Monica	 What?!
85	Ross	 She wants me to move to London.
86	Monica	 But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.
87	Rachel	 What-what-what are you gonna do?
88	Ross	 I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
89	Monica	 Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
90	Ross	 It could happen.
91	[Scene	 Unitel Video, Studio 55, Joey's telethon, he is being shown around by the stage director.]
92	Joey	 (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
93	Stage Director	 This will be your phone.
94	Joey	 That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
95	Stage Director	 No you answer it and take pledges.
96	Joey	 But I'm the host!
97	Stage Director	 No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
98	Joey	 You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
99	Stage Director	 Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)
100	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are there.]
101	Phoebe	 I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
102	Rachel	 Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
103	Phoebe	 I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
104	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
105	Monica	 Sure!
106	Chandler	 If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
107	Rachel	 Chandler! (Pause) Is he?
108	Monica	 Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
109	Chandler	 Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
110	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, he's on the phone with Emily.]
111	Ross	 All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
112	Emily	 I understand that would be difficult.
113	Ross	 Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
114	Emily	 I don't know, it's just…
115	Ross	 Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
116	Emily	 All right.
117	Ross	 All right, did you just say all right?
118	Emily	 I did. Now I'm the idiot.
119	Ross	 Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
120		(She laughs.)
121	Emily	 Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
122	Ross	 Yes, tell me.
123	Emily	 Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
124	Ross	 I know. I am, I am so sorry.
125	Emily	 And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
126	Ross	 Again, very sorry.
127	Emily	 I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
128	Ross	 Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
129	Emily	 All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
130	Ross	 Oh that is so great! That's…
131	Emily	 (interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
132		Commercial Break
133	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is telling Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler about Emily's ultimatum.]
134	Ross	 So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
135	Chandler	 Yes!
136	Phoebe	 Ooh-ohh!
137	Monica	 Great!
138	Ross	 No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
139	Phoebe	 Why?
140	Monica	 What?! You can't—what did you tell her?
141	Ross	 I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!
142	Chandler	 Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
143	Monica	 Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
144	Phoebe	 Yeah.
145	Chandler	 That's true!
146	Phoebe	 Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
147	Chandler	 That's true!
148	Monica	 No, you cannot.
149	Ross	 Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
150		(The phone rings.)
151	Monica	 (answering it) Hello.
152	Joey	 (on phone) Hey Mon!
153	Monica	 Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
154	Joey	 See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
155	Monica	 (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.
156	Joey	 Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)
157	Chandler	 Hey, there he is! There he is!
158	Joey	 Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)
159	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, the chick and the duck are watching Emeril Live, a cooking show.]
160	Emeril	 (on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs…
161		(Chandler enters and sees what they're watching, panics, and runs to turn off the TV.)
162	Chandler	 How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
163	Monica	 (entering) Hi Chandler.
164	Chandler	 Hey!
165	Monica	 Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
166	Chandler	 Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
167	Monica	 William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
168	Chandler	 Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
169	Monica	 Yeah, so?
170	Chandler	 Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
171	Monica	 Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
172	Chandler	 Why?
173	Monica	 Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)
174	Chandler	 What's your point?
175	[Scene	 The Telethon, Joey's phone rings and he answers it.]
176	Joey	 (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.
177	Phoebe	 (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
178	Joey	 What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
179	Phoebe	 Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
180	Joey	 Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
181	Phoebe	 (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)
182	Stage Director	 Back on in 30 seconds people!
183		(Joey gets up and moves to the other end of his row to talk to the guy sitting there.)
184	Joey	 Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
185	PBS Volunteer	 Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
186	Joey	 Come on man! You've been here all day!
187	PBS Volunteer	 Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
188	Stage Director	 We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)
189	Gary Collins	 Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, (As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer getting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to… (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)
190	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are cooking, Chandler is reading a magazine.]
191	Ross	 (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a…)
192	Monica	 A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
193	Phoebe	 Ooh, it's not a toy.
194	Ross	 Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
195	Monica	 All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
196	[Scene	 The Telethon, Joey answers his ringing phone.]
197	Joey	 (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.
198	Phoebe	 (on phone) Hi Joey.
199	Joey	 Hey Pheebs!
200	Phoebe	 I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
201	Joey	 $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
202	Phoebe	 Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
203	Joey	 And you don't a little good about donating the money?
204	Phoebe	 No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
205	Joey	 A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
206	Phoebe	 Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
207	Gary Collins	 (on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers…(He walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
208	Phoebe	 Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
209	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, later that day. Monica is coming out of the bathroom carrying her cleaning gear.]
210	Chandler	 (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
211	Monica	 Keep talking.
212	Chandler	 I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.
213	Monica	 Really?
214	Chandler	 Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
215	Monica	 Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?
216	Chandler	 Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
217	Monica	 But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
218	Chandler	 Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
219	Monica	 Yeah. (She takes them off.)
220		(He carries her over to the door and opens it.)
221	Chandler	 All right, let's show them how it's done.
222	Monica	 Okay.
223		(He starts to carry her into the hallway but hits her head on the door.)
224	Monica	 Ow!
225	Chandler	 Y'know that wasn't part of it?
226	Monica	 I know!
227		(He carries her into the hall.)
228	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross is prying at the Magic 8 Ball with a screwdriver as there's a knock on his door which he goes to answer.]
229	Rachel	 (entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
230	Ross	 For what?
231	Rachel	 For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
232	Ross	 Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
233	Rachel	 Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
234	Ross	 It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
235	Rachel	 Like what?
236	Ross	 Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
237	Rachel	 Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
238	Ross	 No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
239	Rachel	 Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!
240	Ross	 Thanks.
241	Rachel	 Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
242	Ross	 (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing what's going on.)
243		Ending Credits
244	[Scene	 Central Perk, ??????? is playing, as Chandler peaks his head out of the storage closet and sneaks back to his seat and pretends he's reading something. Then a short while later Monica pokes her head out of the closet and sneaks back to her seat and sits down, pretending as if nothing has happened.]
245	Monica	 Never done that before.
246	Chandler	 Nope.
