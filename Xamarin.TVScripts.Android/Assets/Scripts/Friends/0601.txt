2	[Scene	 The Wedding Chapel, continued from last season. Chandler and Monica are about to get married.]
3	Chandler	 Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
4	Monica	 Are you sure you wanna do this?
5		(Suddenly the doors burst open, and ROSS AND RACHEL COME OUT ARM-IN-ARM!!!!! And Rachel's carrying a bouquet!!! THEY GOT MARRIED!!!!)
6	Ross	 Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
7	Rachel	 Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
8		(They storm out into the street.)
9	Rachel	 Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
10		(She goes one way; he goes the other. The camera pans back to Chandler and Monica, and needless to say, they're standing there dumbstruck.)
11	Monica	 Whoa!
12	Chandler	 Oh my God!
13	Joey	 (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
14	Phoebe	 Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
15		(Chandler and Monica are stunned again.)
16	Chandler	 Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
17		(Phoebe and Joey run back out and head towards the street.)
18	Attendant	 (scolding them) N-No running in the chapel!
19	Phoebe	 (to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)
20	Chandler	 Hey!
21	Joey	 Hey!
22	Monica	 What are you guys doing here?
23	Joey	 Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?
24	Chandler	 Yes! Well that-yes.
25	Monica	 Why else would we be here?
26	Joey	 Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
27	Chandler	 We actually missed it.
28	Phoebe	 Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!
29	Monica	 This is insane!
30	Phoebe	 What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.
31	Chandler	 What?!
32	Phoebe	 Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.
33	Monica	 What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
34	Phoebe	 (shocked) Really?!
35	Monica	 Yeah!
36	Phoebe	 Oh my God!—Eh! Well…

38	{Transciber’s note	 In case you haven’t heard, Courteney Cox got married to David Arquette during hiatus and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. But David was a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For they’re all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette, and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman Arquette. I just wonder what the new sleeping arrangements are…}
39	[Scene	 Rachel’s hotel room, she’s waking up with a horrendous hangover.]
40	Rachel	 Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)
41		(Suddenly, there’s movement beside her, startling her. It’s Ross! He wakes up and they both start screaming in terror. Then they both grab their heads having aggravated their hangovers.)
42	Ross	 Why are we in bed together?
43	Rachel	 I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
44	Ross	 (checks) Yeah.
45	Rachel	 Really?!
46	Ross	 No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
47	Rachel	 Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
48	Ross	 And we didn’t have sex.
49		(Rachel agrees with him and starts to get out of bed.)
50	Rachel	 Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.
51	Ross	 (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has "Just Married" written on his back.)
52	[Scene	 The breakfast buffet, Phoebe is already sitting at the table as Joey enters.]
53	Joey	 Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
54	Phoebe	 Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
55	Joey	 Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?
56	Phoebe	 What about my cab?
57	Joey	 I don’t need that anymore.
58	Phoebe	 No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
59	Joey	 I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?
60	Phoebe	 I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.
61	Joey	 It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
62	Phoebe	 Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
63	Joey	 Sure?
64	Phoebe	 All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
65		(Chandler and Monica enter.)
66	Chandler	 Hi!
67	Joey	 Hey.
68	Monica	 Hey.
69	Chandler	 So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
70	Phoebe	 Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
71	Joey	 Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!
72	Chandler	 It’s a buffet man.
73	Joey	 Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)
74	Chandler	 Listen, I gotta talk to you.
75	Joey	 Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)
76	Chandler	 Monica and I almost got married last night.
77	Joey	 Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
78	Chandler	 Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
79	Joey	 Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.
80	Chandler	 What?!
81	Joey	 Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.
82		[Pan to Monica and Phoebe having the same conversation.]
83	Monica	 How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.
84	Phoebe	 Well you don’t.
85	Monica	 Yes I do!
86	Phoebe	 Good! Good! I was just testing you.
87	Chandler	 (returning with Joey) Hi.
88	Monica	 Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.
89	Phoebe	 No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
90		(Ross and Rachel enter.)
91	Ross	 Hey!
92	The Girls	 Hey!
93	Chandler	 Hey!
94		(They both sit down and Rachel pours them both some coffee. They’re acting like nothing’s happened and everyone is just staring at them.)
95	Ross	 What?
96	Chandler	 Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
97	Rachel	 (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
98	Ross	 Yeah!
99	Phoebe	 Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
100		(Rachel turns to Ross stunned.)
101	Monica	 Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!
102	Rachel	 (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
103	Chandler	 (not quite sure) You did.
104	Ross	 What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
105	Rachel	 No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!
106		(They turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get married.)
107	Ross	 We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
108	Rachel	 Oh my God.
109	Ross	 I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
110	Rachel	 No!
111	Joey	 They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
112	Phoebe	 Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!
113	Monica	 What are you guys gonna do?
114	Rachel	 Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
115	Chandler	 Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.
116	Ross	 Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.
117	Joey	 An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.
118	Phoebe	 Oh-oh, that’s your thing.
119	Ross	 What?
120	Phoebe	 You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.
121	All	 Oh yeah!
122	Ross	 No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
123	Phoebe	 Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.
124	[Scene	 The casino floor, Chandler and Monica are walking through it.]
125	Monica	 So, what do you think we should do?
126	Chandler	 I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
127	Monica	 I know I love you! (They hug.)
128	Chandler	 So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
129	Monica	 That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
130	Chandler	 Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
131	Monica	 All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.
132	Chandler	 Sounds great.
133	Monica	 Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
134	Croupler	 Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
135	Monica	 Ready?
136	Chandler	 Ready!
137	Monica	 (sarcastic) Come on eight.
138	Chandler	 (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
139		(Monica rolls the dice.)
140	Croupler	 Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they’re stunned.)
141	Monica	 Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.
142	Chandler	 That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.
143	Monica	 Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
144	Chandler	 That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
145	Monica	 I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
146	Chandler	 Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?
147	Monica	 Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)
148	[Scene	 Phoebe’s cab, Phoebe and Joey are driving back. Phoebe is driving while Joey is sleeping.]
149	Phoebe	 Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
150	Joey	 (wakes up) What?!
151	Phoebe	 Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
152	Joey	 All right. All right.
153	Phoebe	 Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
154	Joey	 Really? I don’t…
155	Phoebe	 Sing!!
156	Joey	 (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
157		[Time lapse, Phoebe is asleep, Joey’s driving and having a hard time staying awake.]
158	Joey	 (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
159		[Time lapse, Phoebe is still asleep only Joey is now passed out next to her and the car’s still moving. She wakes up, sees Joey, and screams.]
160	Hitchhiker	 (driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)
161	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is on the couch as Ross enters.]
162	Ross	 Hey!
163	Rachel	 Hey, hubby!
164	Ross	 Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
165	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
166	Ross	 I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
167		Commercial Break
168	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier. Rachel starts laughing.]
169	Rachel	 Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.
170	Ross	 Yes, exactly!
171	Rachel	 And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
172	Ross	 Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
173	Rachel	 Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.
174	Ross	 I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
175	Rachel	 What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
176	Ross	 Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
177	Rachel	 Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.
178	Ross	 I’m asking you to do me a favor.
179	{Note	 Does anyone else want to smack Ross right about now? Raise your hands. Okay, put them down before you stink out the person next to you.}
180	Rachel	 You are asking me to be your wife!
181	Ross	 And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
182	[Scene	 The hallway, Chandler is helping Monica to the door.]
183	Monica	 That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
184	Chandler	 Well you did pull his hair.
185	Monica	 He took my snack!
186	Chandler	 I’m not getting into this again!
187	Monica	 Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.
188	Chandler	 Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
189	Monica	 This doesn’t mean anything, does it?
190	Chandler	 No!
191	Monica	 Okay.
192	[Scene	 Phoebe’s cab, she’s driving, Joey’s in the back seat, and the hitchhiker is riding up front with Phoebe.]
193	Phoebe	 (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a killer or something!
194	Joey	 Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
195	Phoebe	 Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!
196	Hitchhiker	 No!
197	Phoebe	 Do you like car games?
198	Hitchhiker	 Yeah, y’know the license plate game?
199	Phoebe	 I love the license plate game!
200	Joey	 Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!
201	Phoebe	 No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)
202	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
203	Ross	 Hey!
204	Rachel	 Hey!
205	Ross	 Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
206	Rachel	 (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
207	Ross	 I don’t know if it’s true.
208	Rachel	 Oh b-b-but it is!
209	Ross	 Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
210	Rachel	 Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
211	Ross	 All right. All right, I’ll do it.
212	Rachel	 Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
213		(Ross turns and leaves.)
214	[Scene	 Phoebe’s cab, it’s the same arrangement as before.]
215	Hitchhiker	 Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
216	Phoebe	 Oh, okay.
217	Hitchhiker	 This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
218	Phoebe	 And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
219	Hitchhiker	 All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)
220	Joey	 Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
221	Phoebe	 Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!
222	Joey	 Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
223	Phoebe	 You can still sleep at night and stuff.
224	Joey	 Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.
225	Phoebe	 Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
226	Joey	 Yes.
227	Phoebe	 Is it a meatball sub?
228	Joey	 That is incredible! You are the master!
229	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are there and Rachel is arranging a bouquet of flowers, pricks her finger on a thorn, throws the bouquet over her head, and those you who are quicker than some already know that Monica is the one who catches it.]
230	Rachel	 Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…
231	Monica	 No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!
232	Rachel	 All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)
233	Chandler	 All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
234	Monica	 I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are!
235	Chandler	 Me too!
236	Monica	 I don’t want things to change! Do you?
237	Chandler	 No!
238	Monica	 All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!
239	Chandler	 Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
240	Chandler	 (entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
241	Monica	 Then all your stuff would be here.
242	Chandler	 Well, what if all my stuff was here?
243	Monica	 Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
244	Chandler	 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
245	Monica	 Live together? There have been no signs for that.
246	Chandler	 Me asking is kind of a sign.
247	Monica	 YES!!!!!!!!
248	Chandler	 Okay!!!!!
249		(And the crowd goes wild! Well, at least the live studio audience.)
250	Monica	 Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
251	Chandler	 Okay.
252	Monica	 Here’s your key (Gets him one.)
253	Chandler	 Oh thanks.
254	Monica	 Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
255	Chandler	 The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!
256	Monica	 Ready!
257		(He tries, but something happens.)
258	Chandler	 Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!
259	Monica	 Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!
260	Chandler	 This is not a sign!
261	Monica	 No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!
262	Chandler	 It’s an old key!
263	Monica	 Oh my God it’s old!
264	Chandler	 I love you!
265	Monica	 I love you!
266	Chandler	 Are you hugging the door right now.
267		(Pause)
268	Monica	 No.
269	Chandler	 Yeah-yeah, me neither.
270	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are on the couch as Ross enters.]
271	Ross	 Hey!
272	Rachel	 Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
273	Ross	 Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.
274	Rachel	 Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
275	Ross	 Oh yeah, why not?
276	Rachel	 Pheebs?
277	Phoebe	 No thanks, I’ve already seen one.
278	Rachel	 Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
279	Ross	 Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
280	Phoebe	 Always.
281	Ross	 I didn’t get the annulment.
282	Phoebe	 What?!
283	Ross	 We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)

287	Chandler	 The key’s stuck in the lock.
288	Joey	 I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
289	Chandler	 (trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.
290	Joey	 I’m not finished.
291	Chandler	 Oh.
292		(Joey goes back into the apartment, runs back into the hallway, throws his shoulder against the door, and knocks it down off it’s hinges.)
