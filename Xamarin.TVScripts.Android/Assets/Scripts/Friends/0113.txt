2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler walks in and starts raiding the fridge. Then Rachel comes out of the shower with a towel wrapped round her waist, drying herself with another towel. Chandler and Rachel startle each other and she drops the towel for a second and snatches the rug off the couch.]
3	Rachel	 That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
4	Chandler	 I'm sorry!
5	Rachel	 You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
6	Chandler	 Rachel, wait, wait.
7	Rachel	 No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
8	Chandler	 Can I just say one thing?
9	Rachel	 What? What?!
10	Chandler	 That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
11	Rachel	 Oh!!
12		(She storms off)
13		Opening Credits
14	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there with her boyfriend Roger, talking to Rachel and Monica.]
15	Phoebe	 Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
16	Roger	 That's pretty much it.
17	Phoebe	 Oops!
18	Roger	 But you tell it really well, sweetie.
19	Phoebe	 Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
20	Roger	 Okay. I'll miss you.
21	Phoebe	 Isn't he great?
22	Rachel	 He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
23	Phoebe	 I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
24	Monica	 So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
25	Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
26	Rachel	 Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?
27	Chandler	 Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
28	Rachel	 No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
29	Chandler	 Okay.
30	Roger	 Did I, uh, did I miss something?
31	Chandler	 No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
32	Ross	 You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
33	Chandler	 It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
34	Rachel	 Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
35	Phoebe	 Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
36	Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
37	Chandler	 Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
38	Rachel	 Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
39	Chandler	 Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
40	Roger	 You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
41	Chandler	 Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
42	Roger	 Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
43	Chandler	 Huh.
44	Roger	 I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
45	Chandler	 Uhhuh, how did you know that?
46	Roger	 It's textbook.
47		(Joey enters with his dad)
48	Joey	 Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
49	All	 Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
50	Monica	 Hey, how long are you in the city?
51	Mr. Tribbiani	 Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I don't know this one.
52	Phoebe	 Oh, this is my friend Roger.
53	Roger	 Hi.
54	Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
55	Roger	 You too, sir.
56	Mr. Tribbiani	 (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
57	Joey	 Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)
58	Mr. Tribbiani	 Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
59		(Chandler stays stonefaced)
60	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone.]
61	Mr. Tribbiani	 Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
62	Joey	 (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?
63		(His dad nods. Cut to later. Joey is chopping mushrooms)
64	Mr. Tribbiani	 Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
65	Joey	 Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
66	Mr. Tribbiani	 Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
67	Joey	 Since then?!
68	Mr. Tribbiani	 No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
69	Joey	 ...I d'know.
70	Mr. Tribbiani	 Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
71	Joey	 You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
72	Mr. Tribbiani	 Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
73	Joey	 Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
74	Mr. Tribbiani	 Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
75	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad's affair.]
76	Joey	 It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!
77	Rachel	 I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
78	Chandler	 (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
79	Rachel	 Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
80	Ross	 Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
81	Chandler	 Y'know, I don't see that happening?
82	Rachel	 C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
83	Chandler	 Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
84		(Door buzzer goes)
85	Monica	 Hello?
86	Phoebe	 (Intercom) It's Phoebe.
87	Roger	 (Intercom) And Rog.
88	Monica	 C'mon up.
89	Chandler	 (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
90	Joey	 What's the matter with Rog?
91	Ross	 Yeah.
92	Chandler	 Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
93	Ross	 What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
94		(Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset)
95	Ross	 Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
96	Roger	 I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
97	Ross	 Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
98	Roger	 I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
99	Monica	 Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
100	Roger	 Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
101	Ross	 That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
102	Monica	 Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
103	Phoebe	 Isn't he good?
104	Ross	 Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
105	Monica	 Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
106	Ross	 Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
107		(Cut to later. Rachel is in tears)
108	Rachel	 You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
109	Roger	 That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
110	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
111	Roger	 Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
112	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
113	Monica	 You're welcome.
114	Roger	 Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
115		(He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it)
116	Monica	 Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
117	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's.]
118	Joey	 Night, you guys.
119		(They notice that a woman is sitting by their door)
120	Chandler	 Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
121	Joey	 Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
122	Ronni	 Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
123	Joey	 I'm Joey Tribbiani.
124	Ronni	 Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
125	Chandler	 Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
126		Commercial Break
127	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey's dad is not around.]
128	Ronni	 Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
129	Chandler	 Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
130	Ronni	 That's a good one!
131		(Joey's dad enters.)
132	Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey, Joe.
133	Joey	 Dad, Ronni's here.
134	Mr. Tribbiani	 Huh?
135	Ronni	 Hi.
136	Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
137	Ronni	 Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)
138	Mr. Tribbiani	 Thank you. Uh...
139	Chandler	 So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
140	Ronni	 Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
141	Mr. Tribbiani	 I don't want you taking that thing.
142	Ronni	 Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
143	Joey	 Who-ah-ho.
144	Mr. Tribbiani	 We'll go to a hotel.
145	Ronni	 (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.
146	Joey	 No you won't.
147	Ronni	 No we won't.
148	Joey	 If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
149	Mr. Tribbiani	 You're gonna keep an eye on us?
150	Joey	 That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
151	Ronni	 Wow. He's strict.
152	Joey	 Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
153	Ronni	 Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
154	Chandler	 C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
155	Joey	 Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
156	Mr. Tribbiani	 What kinda change?
157	Joey	 Well, either you break it off with Ronni
158	Mr. Tribbiani	 I can't do that!
159	Joey	 Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
160	Mr. Tribbiani	 Yeah, but this is
161	Joey	 I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
162	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofabed in the living room. Joey is restless.]
163	Chandler	 Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
164	Joey	 Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
165	Chandler	 Well, you're gonna.
166	Joey	 I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
167	Chandler	 Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
168	Joey	 Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
169	Chandler	 Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
170	Joey	 No.
171	Chandler	 No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
172	Joey	 You really think so?
173	Chandler	 Yeah. I really do.
174	Joey	 Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)
175	Chandler	 Get off!
176	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it.]
177	Ronni	 Hi.
178	Monica	 Hi...May I help you?
179	Ronni	 Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
180	Monica	 Okay...who are you?
181	Ronni	 Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
182	Monica	 Oh, c'mon in.
183	Ronni	 Thanks.
184	Rachel	 Hi, I'm Rachel.
185	Ronni	 Hi.
186	Rachel	 Bathroom's up there.
187	Ronni	 Great.
188	Rachel	 Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
189	Ronni	 Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
190	Rachel	 Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib.
191	Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey. Morning, dear.
192		(Rachel goes up to the door of their bathroom)
193	Rachel	 Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
194		(She opens the door and whips back the curtain. It's Joey. They both scream)
195	Joey	 (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
196	Rachel	 I thought it was Chandler!
197	Chandler	 (Comes out of his room) What? What?
198	Rachel	 You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
199	Chandler	 Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
200	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters.]
201	All	 Hey, Pheebs.
202	Phoebe	 Hey.
203	Monica	 How's it going?
204	Phoebe	 Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
205		(Chandler laughs)
206	Phoebe	 So what's going on?
207	Monica	 Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
208	Ross	 I dunno, there's just something about...
209	Chandler	 Basically we just feel that he's...
210	Rachel	 We hate that guy.
211	All	 Yeah. Hate him.
212	Ross	 We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
213	Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
214	All	 ...No, we hate him.
215	Rachel	 We're sorry.
216	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]
217	Joey	 Ma! What're you doing here?
218	Mrs. Tribbiani	 I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this. (Whacks him round the ear)
219	Joey	 Oww! Big ring!
220	Mrs. Tribbiani	 Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and it folds away)
221	Joey	 Hold on, you-you knew?
222	Mrs. Tribbiani	 Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
223	Joey	 So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
224	Mrs. Tribbiani	 Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
225	Joey	 Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
226	Mrs. Tribbiani	 Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
227	Joey	 I'm...happy...for you?
228	Mrs. Tribbiani	 Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
229	Joey	 Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
230	Mrs. Tribbiani	 I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
231	Joey	 Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
232	Mrs. Tribbiani	 That's sweet. Could I take her?
233	Joey	 With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
234	[Scene	 Central Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger.]
235	Roger	 What's wrong, sweetie?
236	Phoebe	 Nothing, nothing.
237	Roger	 Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her head in his lap)
238	Phoebe	 It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
239	Roger	 Oh. They don't.
240	Phoebe	 But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
241	Roger	 What?
242	Phoebe	 Intense and creepy.
243	Roger	 Oh.
244	Phoebe	 But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
245	Roger	 Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
246	Phoebe	 You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
247	Roger	 Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
248	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments.]
249	Monica	 So you talked to your dad, huh.
250	Joey	 Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
251	Rachel	 Wow.
252	Chandler	 Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
253	Ross	 So Joey, you okay?
254	Joey	 Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
255	Rachel	 Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
256	Chandler	 If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
257	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey.
258	All	 Hey, Pheebs.
259	Monica	 How's it going?
260	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
261	All	 Awww.
262	Phoebe	 Yeah, right.
263	All	 Aaawwwwww!!
264	Rachel	 What happened?
265	Phoebe	 I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
266		Closing Credits
267	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]
268	Phoebe	 Hey, Joey. What's going on?
269	Joey	 Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop
270	Monica	 Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
271	Joey	 Sorry. Wrong boobies.
272		(He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks up to the shower door)
273	Monica	 Hello, Joey.
274		(She whips back the curtain to reveal Joey's dad)
275	Mr. Tribbiani	 Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)
276		End
