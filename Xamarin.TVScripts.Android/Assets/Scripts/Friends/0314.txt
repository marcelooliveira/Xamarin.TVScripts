3	Singer	 (singing) ‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....
4	Joey	 Wow! This girl is good.
5	Phoebe	 Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
6	Chandler	 I like her.
7	Phoebe	 (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
8	Chandler	 Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.
9	Monica	 (to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
10	Ross	 Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)
11	Singer	 (singing) beside meeeee-eeee-ee. (everyone applauds her).

13	Singer	 Okay, my next song’s called

16		Opening Credits
17	[Scene	 Central Perk, later.]
18	Singer	 Hey Phoebe.
19	Phoebe	 Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?
20	Leslie	 I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
21	Chandler	 (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.
22	Joey	 (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
23	Phoebe	 Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
24	Joey	 (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?
25	Leslie	 Ah, yeah, umm. (singing) Home is never far away..
26	Monica, Ross, and Joey	 (joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
27	Leslie	 Yeah, but, I don’t do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn’t come up with anything good, so they fired me.
28	Phoebe	 Hmm, bummer.
29	Leslie	 Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you’d want to get back together?
30	Phoebe	 No. But thanks.
31	Leslie	 Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
32	Phoebe	 Okay. No. But thanks.
33	Leslie	 Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. (leaves)
34	Joey	 (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.
35	Phoebe	 Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?
36	Monica	 Yeah, sure.
37	[Scene	 Outside the bathroom, Chandler is pacing back and fourth, waiting is use it.]
38	Gunther	 (to Chandler) Someone in there?
39	Chandler	 No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’
40		(The door opens.)
41	Chandler	 Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
42	Woman	 Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
43		(Gunther walks up)
44	Chandler	 (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.
45	Woman	 Ginger.
46	Chandler	 Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....
47	Ginger	 Don’t you have to use the bathroom?
48	Chandler	 Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
49	Gunther	 Someone in here.
50	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang’s putting their coats on to leave.]
51	Phoebe	 Where’s Chandler?
52	Joey	 Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)
53	Ginger	 Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
54		(She walks over behind the coat rack, but Joey picks it up and moves it so that he’s still behind it, and she can’t see him.)
55	Ginger	 Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.
56		(Joey puts his finger over his mouth to tell Ross to keep quiet. Ginger looks at Monica who looks away and leave.)
57	Joey	 Phew, close one.
58	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Mark is packing his stuff into a box.]
59	Ross	 Hi.
60	Rachel	 Hi, sweetie!
61	Ross	 Hello.
62	Mark	 Hi, Ross.
63	Ross	 Yeah, huh.
64	Rachel	 I’ve got some bad news.
65	Ross	 What?
66	Rachel	 I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
67	Ross	 Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
68	Mark	 Actually, it’s kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
69	Ross	 (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
70	Rachel	 Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.
71	Ross	 Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.
72	Mark	 Okay, then.
73	Ross	 Okay.
74	Rachel	 Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
75	Mark	 Yeah, me too.
76		(Rachel goes to hug him but Ross is holding one of her hands and doesn’t let go, so she can only put one arm around him.)
77	Mark	 So, see ya on Saturday.
78	Rachel	 Yeah, you bet.
79		(Ross is shocked, but Rachel drags him out of the office.)
80	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are playing with a Ouija board, Phoebe’s beeper goes off and Monica screams.]
81	Phoebe	 Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)
82	Monica	 Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
83	Phoebe	 Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
84	Monica	 Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
85	Phoebe	 Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
86	Monica	 Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
87	Phoebe	 You never run on a barge!
88	Joey	 (entering) Hey.
89	Phoebe and Monica	 Hey.
90	Joey	 Is ah, is Chandler around?
91	Monica	 No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
92	Joey	 Oooh.
93	Monica	 Yeah, Ginger something.
94	Joey	 Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
95	Monica	 No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’
96	Joey	 Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.
97	Monica	 Well, what did you do?
98	Joey	 What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.
99	Monica	 Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.
100	Joey	 All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
101	Monica	 You gave her food poisoning!?
102	Joey	 I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
103	Phoebe	 Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
104	Joey	 I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
105		(Phoebe and Monica both stand up and gasp.)
106	Monica	 Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
107	Joey	 I ran!!
108	[Scene	 A street, Chandler is kissing Ginger.]
109	Chandler	 Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.
110	Ginger	 Actually, me too.
111	Chandler	 (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
112	Ginger	 Oh damn, I hate that.
113	Chandler	 Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
114	Ginger	 Oh, don’t worry about it.
115	Chandler	 No, really you’re gonna freeze.
116	Ginger	 No, I’m not.
117	Chandler	 You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
118	Ginger	 Some day, maybe.
119	[Scene	 Ross’s bedroom, Rachel getting into bed while Ross is reading and laughs.]
120	Rachel	 Funny book?
121	Ross	 Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’
122	Rachel	 Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.
123	Ross	 Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
124	Rachel	 Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.
125	Ross	 Oh, well...
126	Rachel	 Oh my God!!! Ross!!
127	Ross	 Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
128	Rachel	 Because, he’s my friend.
129	Ross	 Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
130	Rachel	 Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
131	Ross	 Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
132	Rachel	 I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
133	Ross	 Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
134	Rachel	 Really!?
135	Ross	 Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
136	Rachel	 Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?
137	Ross	 What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.
138	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is looking at her beeper still in the pot. She takes it out, shakes it, and puts it back in.]
139	Monica	 Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
140	Phoebe	 It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.
141	Monica	 Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.
142	Phoebe	 You think you know me so well.
143	Monica	 Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?
144	Phoebe	 Yeah.
145	Monica	 Okay, well I do know you.
146	Phoebe	 That’s what I said.
147	Monica	 Well so?
148	Phoebe	 I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.
149	[Scene	 Central Perk, Leslie is singing.]
150	Leslie	 (singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends, pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
151		(Phoebe runs in and joins her.)
152	Phoebe	 (singing) I stepped in something icky.
153	Phoebe and Leslie	 (singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I’ll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
154		Commercial Break
155	[Scene	 The lecture, Rachel is listening closely, Ross is bored out of his mind.]
156	Lecturer	 We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
157	Ross	 (to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm) You’re so pretty. I love you.
158	Rachel	 Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
159	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is teaching Leslie how to sing Smelly Cat.]
160	Phoebe	 (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.
161	Leslie	 Wow, that’s great.
162	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah!
163	Leslie	 Y'know you could totally sell this. It’d be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
164	Phoebe	 I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
165	Leslie	 What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
166	Phoebe	 Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
167	Leslie	 Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
168	Phoebe	 That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)
169	[Scene	 The lecture, Ross is passed out against Rachel’s shoulder.]
170	Lecturer	 ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
171		(Ross wakes up with a start and startles Rachel. The guy next to him starts laughing, which starts Ross laughing, Rachel gives him a look and he stops.)
172	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is reading the newspaper.]
173	Monica	 (entering) Hi!
174	Chandler	 Hey.
175	Monica	 Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.
176	Chandler	 Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
177	Monica	 So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
178	Chandler	 Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.
179	Monica	 Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.
180	Chandler	 Joey told you about the leg, huh?
181	Monica	 Uh-huh.
182	Chandler	 Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.
183	Joey	 (entering from his bedroom) Morning.
184	Chandler	 (to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
185	Joey	 (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?
186	Chandler	 It came up.
187	Joey	 Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
188		(Both Chandler and Monica walk away in disgust.)
189	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are getting back from the lecture.]
190	Ross	 (entering) So I nodded off a little.
191	Rachel	 Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
192	Ross	 Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
193	Rachel	 Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
194	Ross	 First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.
195	Rachel	 Okay, see now, what I just heard
196	Ross	 Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
197	Rachel	 Oh, that is so...
198	Ross	 No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)
199	Rachel	 Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
200	Ross	 No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.
201	Rachel	 It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
202	Ross	 That’s a little clearer.
203	Rachel	 Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
204	Ross	 Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)
205	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Ginger are eating dinner.]
206	Ginger	 Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?
207	Chandler	 No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
208	Ginger	 It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is
209	Chandler	 No. No. I don’t think so.
210	Ginger	 Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
211		(They start making out. She opens his shirt and feels inside and stops.)
212	Ginger	 What’s that?
213	Chandler	 That’s-that’s my nubbin.
214	Ginger	 What’s a nubbin?
215	Chandler	 It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
216	Ginger	 You have three nipples?
217	Chandler	 Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?
218	Ginger	 Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
219	Chandler	 You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
220	Ginger	 Ah well, it’s nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I’ll see you later. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone runs their fingernails across a blackboard.)
221	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing as Leslie enters.]
222	Phoebe	 (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?
223	Leslie	 Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay, don’t get mad, okay.
224	Phoebe	 Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay
225	Leslie	 I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
226	Phoebe	 No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.
227	Leslie	 No, no, I don’t want to forget it.
228	Phoebe	 Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?
229	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Joey are watching TV.]
230	Commercial	 (in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the litter box? Don’t change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
231		(Monica gets up and shuts off the TV.)
232	Monica	 Sorry, Pheebs.
233	Joey	 Yeah. You okay?
234	Phoebe	 Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
235	Joey	 Yeah.
236	Monica	 We’d love too.
237	Phoebe	 Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.
238		Closing Credits
239	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang except Chandler is there.]
240	Chandler	 (entering, happily) Well hello!
241	Joey	 Where have you been?
242	Chandler	 The doctor.
243	Ross	 Is everything okay?
244	Chandler	 Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
245	Monica	 Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.
246	Rachel	 What?!!
247	Monica	 Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
248	Chandler	 That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
249		End
