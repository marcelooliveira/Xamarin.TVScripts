6	[Scene	 Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter, the others are sitting on the couch.]
7	Monica	 Hey guys!
8	Rachel	 Hi!
9	Phoebe	 Hey!
10	Monica	 We need to talk to you about something.
11	Chandler	 Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
12	All	 What?
13	Phoebe	 Hey!
14	Ross	 Are you kidding?
15	Chandler	 Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
16	Ross	 (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
17	Chandler	 No, no! We made this decision together.
18	Ross	 She's putting words in your mouth!
19	Joey	 Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
20	Rachel	 I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
21	Monica	 No, it's not!
22	Rachel	 It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
23	Phoebe	 Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
24	Monica	 Thank you, Pheebs!
25	Phoebe	 Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
26	Monica	 What? You are way off, lady!
27	Phoebe	 Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
28	Monica	 That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
29	Chandler	 Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
30	Monica	 Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
31	Chandler	 We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
32		OPENING CREDITS

34	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Monica are in there, and Phoebe enters]
35	Phoebe	 Hey!
36	Rachel	 Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
37	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
38	Monica	 You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
39	Phoebe	 You're not making the pies yourself?
40	Monica	 No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
41	Rachel	 Did you at least win the contest?
42	Monica	 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
43	Rachel	 Can't wait!
44	Monica	 This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
45		(Monica leaves)
46	Phoebe	 Hey Rach.
47	Rachel	 Yeah.
48	Phoebe	 What's Emma doing today?
49	Rachel	 Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
50	Phoebe	 Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
51	Rachel	 Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
52	Phoebe	 Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
53	Rachel	 Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
54	Phoebe	 (sarcastic) Oh... okay.
55	Rachel	 Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
56	Rachel	 And a thousand dollars.
57	Rachel	 ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...
58	Phoebe	 Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
59	Rachel	 Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
60	Phoebe	 Well, I was thinking...
61	Rachel	 Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
62	Phoebe	 Yeah!
63		
64	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is watching TV and Monica is cooking]
65	Monica	 (Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
66	Chandler	 Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
67	Monica	 (she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
68	Chandler	 You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
69	Monica	 You don't know that.
70	Chandler	 Somebody is gonna pick us.
71	Monica	 Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
72	Chandler	 I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!
73	Monica	 Name one of his books.
74	Chandler	 (after a long pause) "The Firm"?
75	Monica	 Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
76	Chandler	 You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
77	Monica	 Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
78	Chandler	 I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
79	Monica	 Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
80	Chandler	 Tell me more.
81	Monica	 Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
82	Chandler	 You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
83		(Ross and Joey enter)
84	Ross	 Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
85	Joey	 Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
86	Ross	 Dude, I wanted him to guess.
87	Joey	 Oh.
88	Chandler	 Oh my God!
89	Joey	 Yeah, they're great seats too!
90	Ross	 Guess where they are?
91	Joey	 Center ice.
92	Ross	 Did I do something to you?
93	Chandler	 Hmm, the game's at one.
94	Ross	 So?
95	Chandler	 Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
96	Joey	 So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
97	Chandler	 You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
98	Joey	 Dude, two times that happened!
99	Chandler	 Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
100	Ross	 He's right, man.
101	Joey	 Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
102	Chandler	 Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
103	Joey	 That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)
104	Ross	 We're still going at the game, right?
105	Joey	 Yeah!
106	Ross	 Yeah.
107		
108	[Scene	 Baby beauty contest]
109	Host	 This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
110	Phoebe	 Hey.
111	Rachel	 Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
112	Phoebe	 We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
113	Rachel	 Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
114	Phoebe	 Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
115	Rachel	 Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
116	Phoebe	 (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
117	Rachel	 Phoebe, you have to calm down.
118	Phoebe	 Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
119	Rachel	 Really?
120	Phoebe	 Yeah!
121	Rachel	 You heard them say that?
122	Phoebe	 Yeah!
123	Rachel	 All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
124	Phoebe	 Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
125	Rachel	 No, what?
126	Phoebe	 Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
127	Rachel	 No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
128	Phoebe	 Why not!
129	Rachel	 Because I already did!
130		
131	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden]
132		(there's a lot of shouting and yelling)
133	Joey	 Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
134	Ross	 Oh! What a game, huh?
135	Joey	 I know, yeah.
136	Ross	 I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
137	Joey	 Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
138	Ross	 Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
139	Joey	 Ohhhh! These seats are great!
140	Ross	 I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
141	Joey	 (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
142	Ross	 Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
143	Joey	 I don't know...
144	Ross	 One more fight!
145	Joey	 Okay.
146	Ross	 Okay.
147		
148	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
149	Monica	 Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
150	Chandler	 I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
151		
152	[Scene	 The corridor. Ross and Joey have just arrived.]
153	Joey	 How late are we?
154	Ross	 Forty-five minutes.
155	Joey	 Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
156	Ross	 (handing him his coat) Here!
157	Joey	 Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)
158	Ross	 You may want to lose the foam finger!
159	Joey	 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
160		(Rachel, Phoebe and Emma arrive)
161	Ross	 Hey!
162	Phoebe	 Oh!
163	Joey	 You are not at Thanksgiving?
164	Rachel	 No...
165	Phoebe	 No, we're late!
166	Rachel	 What are you doing here!
167	Ross	 We're late too! (Rachel screams)
168	Joey	 We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
169	Phoebe	 Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
170	Ross	 So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
171	Joey	 Yeah, where were you!
172	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
173	Phoebe	 Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
174	Rachel	 And I won!
175	Ross	 You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
176	Rachel	 Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
177	Ross	 Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
178	Rachel	 Yeah. That's me!
179	Ross	 You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
180	Phoebe	 And it looks like she put makeup on her!
181	Joey	 Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
182	Ross	 I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
183	Rachel	 She won a thousand dollars!
184	Ross	 So this is an annual thing?
185	Joey	 (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
186	Phoebe	 You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
187	Ross	 Yeah. What are we gonna do?
188	Rachel	 Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
189	Joey	 All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
190	Phoebe	 Alright, what are we gonna say?
191	Ross	 Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
192	Phoebe	 Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
193	Joey	 No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
194	Ross	 (to Joey) HEY!
195		
196	[Scene	 Monica's apartment.]
197	Monica	 Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
198	Chandler	 (peeping) They're out there!
199	Monica	 Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
200	Chandler	 (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
201	Monica	 (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
202	Chandler	 (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
203	Monica	 Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
204		[Cut to the hall]
205		(Rachel comes out of her apartment}
206	Rachel	 Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
207	Ross	 I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
208	Phoebe	 We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this
209	Ross	 (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
210	Rachel	 You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
211	Ross	 (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
212	Joey	 (whispering) Who do you think its from?
213		[time lapse – they are still in the hall]
214	Rachel	 Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
215	Ross	 Well, let's just go in there and face them.
216	Phoebe	 Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
217	Joey	 I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
218	Rachel	 Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
219	Joey	 (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!
220	Ross	 What is that?
221	Joey	 That's fire. Beats everything.
222	Phoebe	 Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).
223	Joey	 Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
224	Rachel	 Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
225	All	 Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)
226	Phoebe	 It's locked.
227	Ross	 Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like
228	Rachel	 Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
229		[cut to Monica and Chandler]
230	Monica	 No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
231	Chandler	 Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
232	Monica	 (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
233	Chandler	 (relieved) Oh thank God!
234		[cut to the hall]
235	Ross	 Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
236	Chandler	 (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
237	Ross	 (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
238	Rachel	 You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
239	Joey	 I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)
240		[cut to Monica and Chandler]
241	Monica	 That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
242		[cut to the hall]
243	Ross	 How are we gonna decide who gets this?
244	Joey	 (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
245	Phoebe	 What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
246	Rachel	 (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
247	Phoebe	 Oh yeah!
248		[cut to Monica and Chandler]
249	Monica	 Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
250	Chandler	 Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
251		[cut to the hall]
252		(Rachel comes out of the apartment holding a pot. Joey holds in anticipation and Rachel opens it)
253	Rachel	 Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
254	Ross	 That's worse than no food.
255		[cut to Monica and Chandler]
256		(Monica looks insulted)
257	Chandler	 HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
258	Monica	 Stinky?!
259	Chandler	 Please let me stay on this side of the door.
260		[cut to hall]
261	Rachel	 Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
262	Phoebe	 Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
263	Rachel	 You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)
264	Joey	 (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
265	Ross	 I don't know...
266	Joey	 I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.
267	Ross	 (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!
268		(Rachel finally manages to open the door, but the door chain is on.)
269	Rachel	 Oh!
270		(Joey sticks his head through the gap. Monica and Chandler are now sitting at the dinner table. There is another smaller table full of food standing in front of the front door)
271		(Monica and Chandler do not look amused by Joeys head in the door)
272	Joey	 Oh! It all looks so beautiful
273		(Monica is now smiling)
274	Chandler	 The cranberries...?
275	Monica	 Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
276	Joey	 (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
277	Chandler	 He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)
278	Joey	 Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?
279		(Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's and Phoebe's at the bottom)
280	Ross	 I feel terrible.
281	Phoebe and Rachel	 So, so sorry.
282	Joey	 (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
283	Chandler	 The floating heads do make a good point.
284	Monica	 Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
285	Rachel	 So bad.
286	Ross 	 So bad.
287	Phoebe	 So bad.
288	Monica	 (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
289	Rachel	 Dessert?
290	Monica	 Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
291	Phoebe	 Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
292		(Monica takes it and reads the label)
293	Monica	 Grand Supreme Little Darling?
294	Rachel	 Congratulatioooons!
295	Monica	 Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
296	Ross	 Really girls, not cool.
297	Chandler	 Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
298	Joey	 Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
299	Ross	 It's a day to be thankful.
300	Joey	 (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!
301	Monica	 It's too late for apologies.
302	Joey	 Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
303	Chandler	 That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
304	Rachel	 Ewww, is that what that is?
305	Joey	 Sorry!
306	Phoebe	 Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
307	Rachel	 Yeah! I'll cook!
308	Ross	 Yeah! Let's go out.
309	Rachel	 Hey!
310	Joey	 Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
311	Monica	 The three of us?
312	Joey	 Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
313		(Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel and Ross pull back their heads)
314	Joey	 Ha!
315		(When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices he is stuck)
316	Joey	 Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
317	Monica	 Joey, that is not gonna work.
318	Joey	 No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
319	Phoebe	 I'll pull you through.
320	Ross	 Okay.
321	Joey	 (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
322	Chandler	 A little late for that.
323	Joey	 Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
324	Monica	 Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
325	Chandler	 Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
326	Monica	 Bring it.
327	Joey	 I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
328		(Chandler gives Monica a footlong "eye dropper" with the turkey grease in it)
329	Monica	 Here you go!
330		(She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)
331	Joey	 Oh, that smells good!
332		(And he starts licking the grease which trickles down his face. Monica also squirts some on the other side of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)
333	Joey	 Okay.
334	Monica	 Okay, try it.
335		(Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)
336	Joey	 It isn't working.
337	Monica	 Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
338	Joey	 Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
339	Chandler	 Can you ever feel your ears?
340	Joey	 Interesting...
341	Monica	 Chandler, where are your tools?
342	Chandler	 (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
343	Monica	 I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
344	Rachel	 I lent them to Ross.
345	Ross	 I gave them to Joey.
346	Joey	 I left them at the park.
347	Monica	 Oh!
348	Ross	 (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
349	Phoebe	 I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
350	Ross	 Nice!
351		(The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)
352	Monica	 Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
353	Joey	 It's really starting to hurt.
354	Chandler	 Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
355	Phoebe	 Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
356		(Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)
357	Joey	 Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
358	Chandler	 Come on guys, PUSH!
359	Joey	 Yeah! Come on!
360	Joey and Chandler	 PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
361		(The chain breaks loose from the wall, and because Joey was pushing with all his might, he propells into the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. This table has wheels underneath it, and when Joey falls on this table, he rides into the living room, with all the food falling off, until finally Joey also falls off... Joey gets up quickly, a bit agitated, and acting as nothing happened. He is covered in food stains.)
362	Chandler	 My cranberries!
363	Joey	 (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.
364		(He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler a taste.)
365	Chandler	 Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
366		(Monica enters from the spare bedroom.)
367	Chandler	 (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
368	Monica	 (very emotional) I don't care.
369		(Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)
370	Chandler	 What's going on?
371	Monica	 That was the adoption agency...
372	Chandler	 And?
373	Monica	 WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
374	Chandler	 Are you serious? (they hug)
375	Monica	 There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
376		(They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)
377	Rachel	 I'm so happy for you!
378	Monica	 This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
379		(They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the food off his shirt)
380		COMMERCIAL BREAK
381	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table is set, and there's food on the tables again. They're all there, toasting.]
382	Rachel	 To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
383	Ross	 I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
384	Phoebe	 I know. Have you considered pageanting?
385	Monica	 I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)
386	Joey	 Oh, I know how you feel...
387		(Monica and Chandler are looking curiously at Joey.)
388	Rachel	 Really?
389	Joey	 Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
390	Chandler	 That is the exact same thing.
391		THE END
