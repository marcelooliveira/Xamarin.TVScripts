2	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe is there. Bonnie is telling them of her sex-capades.]
3	Chandler	 (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
4	Bonnie	 All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.
5	Chandler	 Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
6		[cut to Rachel and Monica at the counter.]
7	Rachel	 (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
8	Joey	 Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
9	Monica	 Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.
10	Joey	 Well, I think we all learned something.
11	Phoebe	 (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.
12	Chandler	 (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
13	Phoebe	 Y'know what that means?
14	Joey	 That you’re actually 50?
15	Phoebe	 No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.
16	All	 Oh!
17	Rachel	 That is so cool.
18	Phoebe	 I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
19	All	 Yeah! Yeah, we can!
20	Bonnie	 (to Ross) Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work!
21	Ross	 That’s too bad.
22	Rachel	 (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
23	Phoebe	 So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
24	Joey	 Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
25		(Rachel turns and gives him a look, and Joey quickly apologises.)
26		Opening Credits
27	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are waiting for Phoebe to arrive with the cab.]
28	Monica	 (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
29	Chandler	 You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
30	Monica	 (sarcastic) Thanks!
31	Chandler	 Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.
32		(At that suggestion Monica starts laughing.)
33	Monica	 Yeah right.
34	Chandler	 Why is that so funny?
35	Monica	 You made a joke right? So I laughed.
36	Chandler	 Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
37	Monica	 Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)
38	Chandler	 Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like (in a fake voice) “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”
39	Monica	 Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
40	Joey	 (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!
41	Monica	 Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
42	Joey	 No, it’s just my luggage.
43		(Phoebe drives up.)
44	Chandler, Monica, and Joey	 Hey!!
45	Joey	 Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
46	Phoebe	 Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
47	Ross	 Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
48	Phoebe	 Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.
49	Rachel	 (approaching) Hey!
50	Chandler	 Hey!
51	Joey	 Hey-hey, check out the hat!
52		(She is wearing this giant straw hat, the brim on it must be at least, least foot wide.)
53	Chandler	 What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!
54	Monica	 Seriously, where did you get the hat?
55	Rachel	 Ross gave it to me.
56	Ross	 Yeah, I think she looks good.
57	Rachel	 Ohh, thank you.
58	Chandler	 Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
59	Rachel	 Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
60	Phoebe	 And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
61	[Scene	 At the Beach, it’s raining cats and dogs as the gang arrives. Chandler and Monica are taking shelter under Rachel’s hat.]
62	Ross	 Go, go, go!
63	Rachel	 Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
64		(They get inside and notice on small problem.)
65	Phoebe	 Oy!!
66	Monica	 What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the floor, which is covered in sand)
67	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
68	Ross	 Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
69	[Scene	 Phoebe Sr. house, she is a real estate agent and is trying to sell a house over the phone. By the way, it’s still raining outside.]
70	Phoebe Sr	 Well, yes, it’s kind’ve an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
71	Phoebe	 (at the door) Knock, knock, knock.
72	Phoebe Sr	 (on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in. (on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)
73	Phoebe	 (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
74	Phoebe Sr	 Ahh, yes.
75	Phoebe	 Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!
76	Phoebe Sr	 You’re Erwin’s daughter?!
77	Phoebe	 No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture) Lily, from high school. Remember?
78	Phoebe Sr	 Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
79	Phoebe	 (points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
80	Phoebe Sr	 Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There’s Frank. (points to the picture.)
81	Phoebe	 Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy.
82	Phoebe Sr	 Take it easy--if you want, there’s cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!
83	Phoebe	 No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
84	Phoebe Sr	 Oh.
85	Phoebe	 (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
86	Phoebe Sr	 Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
87	Phoebe	 (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
88	Phoebe Sr	 Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
89	Phoebe	 Oh, what? What was it?
90	Phoebe Sr	 The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
91	Phoebe	 (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.
92	[Scene	 The beach house, it’s still raining. Chandler is building a sand castle, Rachel is doing Monica’s nails, and they’re all drinking margaritas, obviously bored.]
93	Joey	 (getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
94	Monica	 What?!
95	Joey	 I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
96	All	 No, no!
97	Monica	 What are you crazy?!
98	Joey	 Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!
99	Rachel	 (to Monica) Allll done!
100	Monica	 Aww, thank you.
101	Rachel	 Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when she comes to Ross.)
102	Ross	 No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a “Please?” look.) No way!
103	Rachel	 Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.
104		(Ross shoots Joey a look, who shoots Chandler a look, who gives Joey an “Oh my God.” look back.)
105	Ross	 Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend... (She gets up) No!
106	Rachel	 Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)
107	Ross	 Get away!
108	Rachel	 Just once!
109	Ross	 Stay away!
110	Rachel	 Take it like a man, Ross!
111	Ross	 (he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape attempt he crushes Chandler’s sand castle) No!
112	Rachel	 Oh, come on!
113	Chandler	 Big bullies!!
114		(Ross dives over the couch, Rachel goes the other way, and lands up top of him.)
115	Ross	 Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
116		(They get into a wrestling match, that ends with Ross making Rachel paint her forehead with the nail polish. They both end up lying next to each other, stop, and look at each other for a moment.)
117	Phoebe	 (entering) Oh, hey!
118	Chandler	 Hey!
119	Ross	 Hey!
120	Phoebe	 Oh, so, how are we doing?
121	Chandler	 Bored and bored!
122	Joey	 Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
123	All	 Noo!!
124	Monica	 (to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?
125	Phoebe	 I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?
126	Monica	 Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
127	Phoebe	 Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
128	Joey	 What?
129	Rachel	 Really?!
130	Monica	 Oh well, where is he?!
131	Phoebe	 She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isn’t this what he would look like now?
132	Monica	 (gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)
133	Rachel	 Oh, yeah.
134	The Guys	 Yeah!
135	Monica	 Well, why would she lie to you?
136	Phoebe	 I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she’s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don’t know! So, you’re all bored?
137	All	 Ohh!!
138	Chandler	 Yes!
139	Phoebe	 All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
140	Joey	 Okay, all right.
141	Phoebe	 Okay.
142	Joey	 Fan out! Fan out!
143		(They do so, and Phoebe gets in the middle, closes her eyes, and starts spinning in a circle.)
144	Phoebe	 Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She stops at Chandler)
145	Chandler	 Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
146	Joey	 (jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!
147		[cut to later]
148	Monica	 Strip Happy Days Game?
149	Joey	 Yeah, well, I couldn’t find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
150		(Monica rolls, and Ross goes first.)
151	Ross	 Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
152	Phoebe	 Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet, but we’re all very excited.
153	Ross	 Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let’s see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
154	The Girls	 Woo-hooooo!!!!
155	Joey	 All right, relax. It’s just a shoe.
156	All	 Wooooo!!!!
157		[cut to later in the game]
158	Rachel	 (reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey’s boxers!
159	Joey	 Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
160	Phoebe	 Come on, take ‘em off!!
161	Joey	 Actually, y'know it’s kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
162	Rachel	 (getting up) All right, I’m gonna make more margaritas! (She pours the rest of the pitcher into Ross’s glass.)
163	Ross	 Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
164	Rachel	 I’m just making margaritas.
165	Ross	 Okay.
166	Monica	 I think I’ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?
167	Rachel	 What?!
168	Monica	 You painting his toenails?
169	Rachel	 Oh, come on!
170	Monica	 Chasing him all around the room?
171	Rachel	 Monica, please?
172	Monica	 He’s totally flirting with you too.
173	Rachel	 (pause) He is, isn’t he? I don’t know, I don’t know, I mean maybe it’s just being here at the beach together or, I don’t know. But it’s like something... (she’s interrupted by the sound of Bonnie entering)
174	Bonnie	 Hey!
175	Ross	 Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!
176	Bonnie	 Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
177	Ross	 Oh.
178	Bonnie	 What are you guys doing?!
179	Joey	 We’re playing Strip Happy Days Game!
180	Bonnie	 Cool! I’ll catch up! (She takes off her sweater.)
181		Commercial Break
182	[Scene	 The beach house, the next morning. Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen eating breakfast.]
183	Chandler	 So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?
184	Monica	 Huh?
185	Chandler	 I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
186	Monica	 You didn’t even take off your pants.
187	Chandler	 Yeah, well, lucky for you.
188	Monica	 What?
189	Chandler	 I don’t know.
190	Rachel	 (entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
191	Phoebe	 Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.
192		(Joey is sleeping on the floor and is buried in sand that has been carved into a mermaid complete with breasts.)
193	Phoebe	 After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
194	Rachel	 Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
195	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
196		(Ross and Bonnie enter)
197	Ross	 Good morning.
198	All	 Hey.
199	Bonnie	 Hey! How did everybody sleep?
200	Rachel	 Oh, great.
201	Monica	 Like a log.
202	Ross and Bonnie	 Us too.
203	Rachel	 I’m going for a walk.
204		(Joey finally wakes up.)
205	Ross	 (to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
206		(Joey looks down and his look turns from shock to satisfaction.)
207	[Scene	 The porch, Bonnie is coming back from swimming, Rachel is reading.]
208	Bonnie	 Hey, what happened to you?
209	Rachel	 Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.
210	Bonnie	 Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
211	Rachel	 Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
212	Bonnie	 Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
213	Rachel	 Ohh-ha-ha!
214	Bonnie	 I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
215	Rachel	 Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
216	Bonnie	 Really?!
217	Rachel	 Ohh!
218	Bonnie	 Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
219	Rachel	 Really?!
220	Bonnie	 Yeah!
221	Rachel	 I mean you definitely should do that.
222	Bonnie	 Y'know what, I should do it.
223	Rachel	 Yeah!
224	Bonnie	 Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
225	Rachel	 Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
226	Bonnie	 All right.
227		(As Bonnie goes to do just that, Rachel smiles to herself, proud of what she’s done.)
228	[Scene	 The beach house, at night. Phoebe is hangs up the phone, and gently pushes one of the stools over.]
229	Joey	 What’s the matter, Pheebs?
230	Phoebe	 She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
231	Joey	 What?!
232	Phoebe	 Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won’t tell me.
233	Rachel	 Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
234	Phoebe	 Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet. (she starts to leave)
235	Chandler	 Where ya going?
236	Phoebe	 Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
237	Ross	 Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
238	Phoebe	 Well, are any of those people here?!
239	All	 Oh, no!! No, no!
240	Phoebe	 Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her ice trays.
241		(She exits just as Bonnie comes down the stairs, as bald as Michael Jordan.)
242	Bonnie	 Hey, everybody!
243	All	 Wow!! (they all recoil in shock and horror)
244	Ross	 Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.)
245	Bonnie	 You wanna touch it?
246	Ross	 Nooo, but it, but it’s great.
247	Bonnie	 Come on, touch it!
248	Ross	 Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.
249	[Scene	 Outside the beach house, Ross is coming out to talk to Rachel.]
250	Ross	 Hi.
251	Rachel	 Hi!
252	Ross	 I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right, that’s right, it was you!
253	Rachel	 That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
254	Ross	 She said you gave her the razor!
255	Bonnie	 (joining them) Hey guys.
256	Rachel	 Hey!
257	Bonnie	 So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
258	Ross	 Ahh, no, I’m good.
259	Bonnie	 Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.
260	Ross	 Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
261	Rachel	 Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.
262	Ross	 You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
263	Rachel	 I don’t know.
264	Ross	 You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
265	Rachel	 All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?
266	Ross	 Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?
267	Rachel	 Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
268	Ross	 You still love me?
269	Rachel	 Noo.
270	Ross	 You still love me.
271	Rachel	 Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
272	Ross	 Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
273	Rachel	 Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...
274	Ross	 What?!
275	Rachel	 I just, I feel, I-I just...
276	Ross	 What?
277	Rachel	 I feel...
278		(Ross leans in and kisses her. They both look at each other for a moment, and then embrace in a more passionate kiss, only to be interrupted by Joey and Chandler coming outside.)
279	Chandler	 (to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
280		(Rachel and Ross both stop kissing, and quickly step back from each other.)
281	Joey	 But I made cards!!
282	Rachel	 Well! Good night. (to Ross) I’m going upstairs.
283	Joey and Chandler	 G’night.
284		(Rachel walks inside, stops, and turns back to look at Ross for a moment then goes upstairs.)
285	Joey	 (to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?
286	[Scene	 Phoebe Sr.’s house, Phoebe is breaking in through a window.]
287		(She throws her bag inside, and starts to climb through the window. She gets halfway in and the window slams shut on her butt.)
288	Phoebe	 Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!
289		(She starts walking across the darkened room and hits her head on a wind chime hanging from the ceiling, to stop it from making a noise she grabs it and “Shhh’s” it. She goes into the kitchen and finds Phoebe Sr.’s appointment book, to read it she opens the freezer. Just as she starts to read, Phoebe Sr. jumps out from her bedroom with a coat hanger, startling Phoebe.)
290	Phoebe	 No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!
291	Phoebe Sr	 Then don't break in!!
292	Phoebe	 I’m sorry.
293	Phoebe Sr	 What are you doing here?!
294	Phoebe	 I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
295	Phoebe Sr	 What?!
296	Phoebe	 Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you’re just mean! (pause) So, just tell me the truth!
297	Phoebe Sr	 All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
298	Phoebe	 My Father is Chuck Magioni?
299	Phoebe Sr	 No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth.
300	Phoebe	 Oh.
301	Phoebe Sr	 But umm, you’re right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, (pause) ahh, (pause) okay. I’m your mother.
302	Phoebe	 Heh?
303	Phoebe Sr	 Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
304		(At that Phoebe’s eyes open in shock.)
305	[Scene	 Outside the beach house, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler what happened with Rachel.]
306	Joey	 I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
307	Ross	 That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
308	Chandler	 Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......
309	Ross	 I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
310	Bonnie	 (coming back from her swim) Hey!
311	Chandler	 Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
312	Bonnie	 You guys, the water’s great. You should really go in.
313	Chandler	 Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
314	Bonnie	 Okay, well g’night.
315	Ross	 Good night.
316	Bonnie	 (kisses Ross) Don’t be too long.
317	Ross	 Okey-dokey!
318	Chandler	 There is not one hair on that head.
319	Ross	 Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
320	Joey	 So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
321	Ross	 Yeah.
322	Joey	 Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie’s free tonight?
323	[Scene	 The hallway between the bedrooms. Ross is coming upstairs and stops between two doors. He looks at the one on the right, then he looks at the one on his left, thinks about it, and goes in the one on his right.]
324	Ross	 (entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
325		Closing Credits
326	[Scene	 The beach house, Chandler is simulating he’s coming to pick up Monica for a date. Chandler knocks on the door, and Monica answers it.]
327	Chandler	 (in a fake voice) Hi there.
328	Monica	 That’s that weird voice again.
329	Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
330		(Monica closes the door, Chandler knocks, and Monica opens it to reveal Chandler on his knees.)
331	Chandler	 Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good stuff!!
332		End
