2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's Bathroom, Chandler and Monica are sharing a candlelight bubble bath while drinking champagne and they clink their glasses.]
3	Monica	 You look cute in bubbles.
4	Chandler	 Ehh, you're just liquored up.
5		(They move into kiss but are interrupted by Joey knocking on the door.)
6	Joey	 Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
7		(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what Chandler's doing.)
8	Chandler	 I've had a very long, hard day.
9	Joey	 Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
10	Chandler	 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
11	Joey	 Okay.
12		(Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)
13	Joey	 You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
14	Chandler	 For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
15	Joey	 All right!
16		(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)
17	Chandler	 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
18	Monica	 Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
19	Chandler	 Hey Joe!
20		(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)
21	Chandler	 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
22		pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.
23		(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)
24		Opening Credits
25	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.]
26	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
27	Chandler	 Hey, Pheebs!
28	Joey	 Mornin' Pheebs!
29	Phoebe	 I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…
30	Joey	 (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)
31	Phoebe	 What?
32	Joey	 Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
33	Phoebe	 Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…
34	Monica	 Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
35	Chandler	 Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
36	Joey	 Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…
37	Monica	 Bodington's!
38	All	 Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)
39	Chandler	 Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
40	Phoebe	 Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.
41	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
42	All	 Hey!
43	Joey	 Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
44	Ross	 Yeah! (They high-five.)
45	Joey	 That was good beer.
46	Ross	 Ohh…
47	Joey	 Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
48	Ross	 Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
49	Joey	 Later! (Exits.)
50	Ross	 Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
51	Monica	 Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.
52	Ross	 Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
53	Monica	 No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
54	Ross	 Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
55	Phoebe	 So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
56	Ross	 No, not since I lost her at the airport.
57	Chandler	 I can't believe she can out run you man!
58	Ross	 HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
59	Rachel	 (entering) Hi!
60	All	 Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)
61	Ross	 Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
62	Rachel	 Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
63	Ross	 That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
64	Rachel	 Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)
65	Ross	 So, what? That's it?
66	Rachel	 Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
67	Ross	 Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)
68	Rachel	 Oh no, you're the best.
69	Ross	 (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
70	Chandler	 Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
71		(Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season. Read about it here.)
72	Monica	 Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
73	Rachel	 What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
74	Chandler	 Oh that's not true.
75	Rachel	 Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
76	Phoebe	 London is stupid! Stupid!
77	Rachel	 Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
78	Phoebe	 Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
79	Monica	 I'll do it!
80	Rachel	 That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
81	Chandler	 Okay, I gotta go to work.
82		(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in amazement. After the kiss ends, Chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides to do something rather rash.)
83	Chandler	 And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
84		(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is shocked.)
85	Chandler	 Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
86	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey are there looking at pictures from the trip to London.]
87	Monica	 Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
88	Rachel	 Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)
89	Monica	 Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
90	Rachel	 I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)…
91	Monica	 Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
92	Rachel	 …I mean it's my fault.
93	Monica	 Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
94	Rachel	 Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)
95	Monica	 Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
96	Joey	 (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
97	Monica	 If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
98	Rachel	 Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…
99	Monica	 (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
100	Rachel	 Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
101	Monica	 You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
102	Rachel	 All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
103	Joey	 Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
104	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
105	Rachel	 Hey!
106	Joey	 Hey, Pheebs!
107	Monica	 We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
108	Phoebe	 (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)
109	Chandler	 All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
110	Phoebe	 No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
111	All	 Sorry.
112		(Rachel returns.)
113	Monica	 What happened?
114	Rachel	 Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
115	Monica	 See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
116	Rachel	 Well…
117		(Gunther goes up to the guy and holds a sign that reads, "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.")
118	Gunther	 (To the guy) Get out!
119	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters to find Monica waiting patiently for him. He closes the door and they start kissing.]
120	Monica	 What took you so long?
121	Chandler	 I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
122	Monica	 Oh, good.
123		(They start kissing and turn around so that Chandler is facing the door. And Chandler sees Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey walk in and quickly ends the kiss with Monica.)
124	Chandler	 So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)
125	Joey	 (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
126	Monica	 Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
127	Rachel	 That's not European!
128	Phoebe	 Well, it felt French.
129		(Joey is intrigued.)
130	[Scene	 The hallway between the apartments, Rachel is returning from her date with Dave.]
131	Rachel	 Oh God, I really had a good time!
132	Dave	 Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.
133	Rachel	 Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
134	Dave	 Yeah!
135	Rachel	 Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
136	Dave	 Okay, yeah!
137		(She enters the apartment, leaving Dave in the hallway, to find Ross sitting on the couch with a big box.)
138	Rachel	 Umm, hi!
139	Ross	 Hi.
140	Rachel	 Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
141	Ross	 She's doing her laundry.
142	Rachel	 What's that? (Points to the box.)
143	Ross	 It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
144	Rachel	 Oh, honey that's awful.
145	Ross	 Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
146	Rachel	 But, it's not raining.
147	Ross	 I can't catch a break!
148	Rachel	 Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!
149	Dave	 Yeah?
150	Rachel	 Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
151	Monica	 (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
152	Rachel	 Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)
153	Monica	 What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
154	Rachel	 Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
155	Monica	 I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
156	Rachel	 Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
157	Monica	 (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
158	Rachel	 Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
159	Monica	 I make the decisions, and I say no.
160	Rachel	 Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
161	Monica	 You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
162	Rachel	 Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)
163	Monica	 Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
164	Joey	 (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
165	Monica	 Rachel locked the door.
166	Joey	 I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
167		Commercial Break
168	[Scene	 The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.]
169	Monica	 Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
170		[Cut to inside the apartment, Ross decides to let Monica in and goes over and opens the door in mid-pound.]
171	Monica	 Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
172	Rachel	 No.
173	Monica	 I really need to talk to you.
174	Rachel	 Well, then talk!
175	Monica	 Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
176	Rachel	 Yes!
177	Ross	 What thing?
178	Monica	 Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.
179	Ross	 Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.
180	Rachel	 I'm gonna do it.
181	Monica	 All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
182	Rachel	 But I…
183	Monica	 Please!
184	Rachel	 All right, fine.
185		(There's a loud bang on the door.)
186	Monica	 Joey, I'm in!
187	Joey	 (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.
188	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters.]
189	All	 Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
190	Joey	 Uh, okay, Pheebs?
191	Phoebe	 Yeah?
192	Joey	 Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
193	Phoebe	 Yeah?
194	Joey	 All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
195	Phoebe	 Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
196	Monica	 Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!
197	Phoebe	 (excited) Central…(not so excited) Park!
198	Joey	 Yeah, all of us! All day!
199	Phoebe	 That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
200	Chandler	 Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)
201	Rachel	 (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!
202	Chandler	 I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
203	Phoebe	 That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
204	Monica	 Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)
205	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with Phoebe.]
206	Ross	 Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
207	Joey	 Phoebe!
208	Chandler	 Hey, Pheebs!
209	Rachel	 Phoebe, woo!
210	Phoebe	 Okay, woo! Hi.
211	Chandler	 Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
212	Phoebe	 Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
213	Joey	 Mine!
214	Ross	 Wait! It was my plan.
215	Joey	 Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
216	Ross	 And, I came up with Atlantic City.
217	Joey	 Which, is the new plan!
218	Monica	 Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
219	Phoebe	 Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
220		(They all go pack except for Ross.)
221	Monica	 Come on Rach, let's go.
222	Rachel	 Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
223	Monica	 No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
224	Rachel	 Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
225	Monica	 Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
226	Rachel	 Yeah, I-I don't care.
227	Monica	 Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
228	Rachel	 What 'cha readin'?
229	Ross	 The paper.
230	Rachel	 Yeah, what's it about?
231	Ross	 Events from around the globe.
232	Rachel	 Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
233	Ross	 Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…
234	Rachel	 Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
235	Ross	 Yeah.
236	Rachel	 Okay.
237	Ross	 Go ahead.
238	Rachel	 Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.
239		(Ross is stunned.)
240	Ross	 Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
241		(Rachel starts laughing hysterically.)
242	Ross	 What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
243	Rachel	 (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
244	Ross	 Why are you laughing?
245	Rachel	 Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like, "You are such an idiot!"
246	Ross	 Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
247	Rachel	 (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.
248	Ross	 Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
249	Rachel	 Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
250	Ross	 Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…
251	Rachel	 The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
252	Ross	 That is what the thing is.
253	Rachel	 Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
254	Ross	 No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
255	Rachel	 That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)
256	Ross	 No thank you for… Thank you.
257	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is about ready to leave for Atlantic City.]
258	Ross	 Okay, let's go!
259	Chandler	 Atlantic City!
260	Phoebe	 Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
261		(They high-five and howl, but Phoebe suddenly stops and the guys gasp and retreat in shock.)
262	Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
263	Monica	 Oh my God! You're water broke!
264	The Guys	 Ohh!
265	Phoebe	 All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)
266	All	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
267	Chandler	 Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
268	Ross	 Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
269	Rachel	 High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)
270	Phoebe	 Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)
271		Ending Credits
272	[Scene	 The hallway between the apartments, they are taking Phoebe to the hospital but Chandler and Monica hold back.]
273	Monica	 I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
274	Chandler	 I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
275		(They both kiss.)
276	Chandler	 Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
277	Monica	 Do you know anything about women?
278	Chandler	 No.
279	Monica	 That's all right.
280	Chandler	 Okay. (They kiss again.)
