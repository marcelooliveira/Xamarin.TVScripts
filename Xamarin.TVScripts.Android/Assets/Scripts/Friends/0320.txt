2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey are there.]
3	Chandler	 Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!
4	Joey	 Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?
5	Monica	 Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?
6	Joey	 Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!
7	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!
8	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
9	All	 Hey!
10	Ross	 Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
11	Monica	 Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
12	Ross	 We were all pretty shaken up about it.
13	Phoebe	 Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.
14	Ross	 Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
15	Monica	 Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
16	Ross	 You get the dollhouse.
17	Monica	 I get the dollhouse!
18	Phoebe	 Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
19	Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
20	Phoebe	 No, just a barrel.
21	Monica	 Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
22	Phoebe	 Really?! Really?!
23	Monica	 Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
24	Chandler	 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Chandler and her are coming back from lunch.]
27	Rachel	 Hey, Sophie!
28	Sophie	 Hey, Rach!
29	Chandler	 Hey.
30	Sophie	 Hey.
31	Rachel	 Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.
32	Chandler	 Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
33	Rachel	 Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?
34	Chandler	 Yes, I realise that.
35	Rachel	 Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
36	Chandler	 That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
37		[Rachel’s boss, Joanna, enters]
38	Joanna	 Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You don’t work for me.
39	Rachel	 (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.
40	Joanna	 Bing! That’s a great name.
41	Chandler	 Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
42	Joanna	 Me too.
43	Rachel	 Bye, Chandler.
44	Joanna	 (to Rachel) So ah, what’s wrong with him?
45	Rachel	 Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
46	Joanna	 Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
47	Rachel	 No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!
48	Joanna	 Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.
49	Rachel	 Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?
50	Joanna	 Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
51	Sophie	 Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
52	Joanna	 I know that.
53	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is showing off her new dollhouse. It’s a huge dollhouse, that takes up the entire living room table.]
54	Monica	 Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
55	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
56	Chandler	 Hello.
57	Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.
58	Monica	 I know!!!
59	Phoebe	 So, I’m here, ready to play.
60	Monica	 Okay.
61	Phoebe	 I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
62	Monica	 What’s this?
63	Phoebe	 That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.
64	Monica	 Not one that can pee on the roof.
65	Phoebe	 Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
66	Chandler	 (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
67	Phoebe	 No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.
68	Monica	 I don’t want a ghost.
69	Phoebe	 Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
70	Ross	 Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
71	Phoebe	 Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.
72	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
73	All	 Hello.
74	Rachel	 I need to talk to you!
75	Ross	 Sure, what’s up?
76	Rachel	 Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
77	Ross	 I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
78	Chandler	 Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
79	Rachel	 Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
80	Chandler	 Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!
81	Rachel	 (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
82	Chandler	 Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.
83	Rachel	 Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.
84	Phoebe	 (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
85	Monica	 Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.
86	Phoebe	 Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.
87	Ross	 Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!
88	Phoebe	 The little ones do.
89	[Scene	 The Theatre, Joey and Kate are getting ready to rehearse the play.]
90	Joey	 Hey, Kate!
91	Kate	 Morning.
92	Joey	 Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
93	The Director	 Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)
94	Joey	 (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
95	Woman	 Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy.
96	Joey	 Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
97	Lauren	 I know! I-I’m a big fan of yours.
98	Joey	 (looks at her, shocked) What?!
99	Lauren	 I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
100	Joey	 Get out of here, really?!
101	Lauren	 Absolutely!
102	Joey	 Yeah?
103	Lauren	 Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
104	Joey	 They gave me the shaft all right.
105	Lauren	 (laughing) Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
106	Joey	 Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
107	Lauren	 Cool! I-I’ll see you then.
108	Joey	 All right.
109	The Director	 All right, it’s time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and Kate just look at each other.)
110	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with her own dollhouse, that she made herself.]
111	Phoebe	 Hey!
112	All	 Hey!
113	Phoebe	 Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
114	Rachel	 Wow!!
115	Phoebe	 Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
116	Ross	 Hey, what’s this?!
117	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)
118	Monica	 It’s very interesting, Phoebe.
119	Rachel	 What’s this?
120	Phoebe	 The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
121	Ross	 This is the coolest house ever!!
122		(Monica is looking on with a hurt expression on her face.)
123	Phoebe	 Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
124	Rachel	 All right!
125	Ross	 I would!
126	Monica	 Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
127	Ross and Rachel	 Uh-huh.
128	Phoebe	 Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)
129	Ross and Rachel	 Ooohhhh!!
130	Phoebe	 And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
131	Ross and Rachel	 Ahhhh!!
132	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!
133	Rachel	 (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
134	Chandler	 Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
135	Rachel	 Hmm.
136	Chandler	 Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!
137	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Joanna’s telling Rachel, her side of the story.]
138	Joanna	 Chandler is fantastic!!
139	Rachel	 What?!
140	Joanna	 Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
141	Rachel	 Oh, I....
142	Joanna	 Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a good heart?
143	Rachel	 Oh, I know...
144	Joanna	 Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
145	Sophie	 Isn’t this great?!
146	Joanna	 Don’t spoil it.
147	[Scene	 The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing.]
148	Joey	 Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?
149		[A phone rings.]
150	The Director	 (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, just one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! (He goes to take the call.)
151	Joey	 (to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
152	Kate	 He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating.
153	Joey	 Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?
154	Kate	 I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?
155	Joey	 Do you want me to want you to care?
156	Kate	 Do you?
157	Joey	 What?
158	The Director	 (returning) Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off.
159		[They resume rehearsing.]
160	Joey	 Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?
161	Kate	 I’ve got no reason to stay.
162		(Joey grabs her and kisses her.)
163	The Director	 Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I’ll see you in the morning. (exits)
164	Kate	 I can’t believe we go on in, in a week.
165	Joey	 Hey, it’s gonna be all right.
166	Lauren	 (to Joey) Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
167	Joey	 What?
168	Lauren	 You know! At the place I told you about last night?
169	Joey	 Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
170	Lauren	 Oh, okay.
171	Joey	 Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
172	Lauren	 I’ll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)
173	Joey	 Okay.
174	Lauren	 G’night. (exits)
175	Joey	 (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?
176	Kate	 Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
177	Joey	 I don’t know.
178	Kate	 Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
179	Joey	 How do you mean?
180	Kate	 Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
181	Joey	 Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
182	Kate	 Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
183	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
184	Kate	 And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
185	Joey	 And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
186	Kate	 And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
187		[cut to Joey’s bedroom, Joey and Kate are emerging from under the covers.]
188	Joey	 Something like that?
189	Kate	 Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind.
190	Joey	 Yeah.
191		Commercial Break
192	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are eating breakfast as Joey enters, very happily.]
193	Joey	 (to Ross) Hey.
194	Ross	 Hi.
195	Joey	 (to Monica) Hey.
196		(He walks up behind Monica and gives her a big hug and a kiss on the neck.)
197	Ross	 Hi.
198	Joey	 Hey.
199		(He walks over behind Ross, thinks about it for a moment, and gives him a big hug.)
200	Ross	 It’s a little early to be drinkin’.
201	Joey	 No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
202	Ross	 Ohhhhh!
203	Monica	 You’re kidding?! That’s great!
204	Joey	 Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...
205	Monica	 Oh my.
206	Joey	 Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been processed by the devil, or something.)
207	Chandler	 (entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’
208	Rachel	 Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?
209	Chandler	 That’s what you say at the end of a date.
210	Rachel	 You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’
211	Chandler	 To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.
212	Monica	 Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?
213	Rachel	 Well, they always called.
214	Monica	 Hmm, bite me.
215	[Scene	 Rachel’s office.]
216	Joanna	 (entering) Did he call?
217	Rachel	 No. Sorry.
218	Joanna	 Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?
219	Sophie	 Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
220	Joanna	 Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?
221	Rachel	 Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
222	Joanna	 Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
223	Rachel	 Well...
224	Joanna	 The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?
225	Rachel	 No. I...
226	Joanna	 Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
227	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is reading a magazine as Rachel approaches.]
228	Rachel	 (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
229	Chandler	 Multiple, so many paper cuts.
230	Rachel	 Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!
231	Chandler	 (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
232	Rachel	 Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!
233	Chandler	 Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’
234	Rachel	 Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.
235	Chandler	 Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
236	Rachel	 I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
237	Chandler	 All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
238	Rachel	 That’s fine!
239	Chandler	 That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.
240	Rachel	 I know.
241	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
242	Ross	 Mon?
243	Monica	 (from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!
244		[He closes the door and walks over to get something from the fridge. He starts to smell something and turns around to see Phoebe’s dollhouse smoking. He runs over and takes off the roof to reveal that the dollhouse fire.]
245	Ross	 Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!
246		[He tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesn’t work. He runs over to the sink to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. In desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesn’t work. He then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. He kicks open the door and we hear Monica scream at the top of her lungs.]
247	[Scene	 The Theatre, Kate is arriving for rehearsal.]
248	Joey	 Hey.
249	Kate	 Hi.
250	Joey	 So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
251	Kate	 About what?
252	Joey	 Y'know, about what happened with us.
253	Kate	 Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay?
254	Joey	 What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.
255	Kate	 Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
256	Joey	 Nooo.
257	Lauren	 (entering) Hi, Kate!
258	Kate	 Hi, Lauren.
259	Joey	 Hi, Lauren.
260	Lauren	 Hi, pig!
261	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are inspecting the damage to the dollhouse.]
262	Ross	 Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
263	Monica	 Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
264	Ross	 Yeah.
265	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
266	Monica	 (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.
267	Phoebe	 What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!
268	Ross	 Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.
269	Phoebe	 All right. Did everyone get out okay?
270	Monica	 Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.
271	Phoebe	 Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)
272	Ross	 No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!
273	Phoebe	 (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
274		(She picks up a charred piece of plastic that once was the Foster puppets, and starts to break down. Monica goes over and comforts her.)
275	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Chandler and Joanna are returning from their lunch date. He is telling her about her mascara problem. Rachel is already there.]
276	Chandler	 It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.
277	Joanna	 Well, thanks again for lunch.
278	Chandler	 (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.
279		(Rachel is slowing trying to leave and let them talk.)
280	Joanna	 It was, wasn’t it?
281	Chandler	 The food there was, was great.
282	Joanna	 Wasn’t it?
283	Chandler	 So take care.
284	Joanna	 You too.
285	Chandler	 Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
286	Joanna	 Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
287	Rachel	 Sophie’s desk.
288		(Chandler starts to leave ashamed of himself, but Rachel stops him in the hallway.)
289	Rachel	 (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
290	Chandler	 Noo!
291	Rachel	 Chandler!!
292	Chandler	 Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
293	Rachel	 Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
294	Chandler	 Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.
295	Joanna	 What?
296	Chandler	 I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.
297	Joanna	 Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
298	Chandler	 Yeah, o-okay.
299	Joanna	 So...
300	Chandler	 Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
301		(Rachel is shocked, and holds her arms out in disbelief.)
302		Closing Credits
303	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is talking on the phone.]
304	Joey	 (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
