2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is showing everyone a poster as Ross enters.]
3	Ross	 Hey! What are you guys looking at?
4	Joey	 Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.
5	Ross	 Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
6	Joey	 Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!
7	Ross	 Now I cannot wait to see this.
8	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.
9	Phoebe	 I started that!
10	Joey	 I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited! (They all gasp.)
11	Monica	 Are we gonna take a limo?
12	Joey	 Sure! Why not?!
13	Monica	 Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
14	Rachel	 Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
15	[Scene	 Central Perk, time lapse, and Rachel is entering still pregnant.]
16	Rachel	 That’s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
17	Ross	 Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)
18	Rachel	 You. Like you haven’t done enough.
19	Ross	 Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)
20		(Rachel turns and looks at the group on the couch and they move over. Chandler measures the room they’ve made with his arm and decides it’s not enough and they all move over again.)
21	Rachel	 God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
22	Phoebe	 Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…
23	Rachel	 (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
24	Chandler	 Let’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are there as Rachel enters.]
27	Chandler	 Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
28	Rachel	 Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.
29	Monica	 What are you doing here so early?
30	Rachel	 They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.
31	Phoebe	 Or you can do volunteer work.
32		(Joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.)
33	Joey	 Hello?
34	Estelle	 Joey! It’s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
35	Joey	 One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
36	Estelle	 Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You’ll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
37	Joey	 Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?
38	Estelle	 Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?
39	Joey	 (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
40	Rachel	 (overhearing that) What-what about me?
41	Joey	 You said you didn’t want to go.
42	Rachel	 I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.
43	Joey	 Definitely not invisible.
44	Monica	 Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.
45	Chandler	 He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.
46	Monica	 Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
47	Chandler	 I haven’t seen this dress.
48	Monica	 Star in a movie.
49	Phoebe	 Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.
50	Joey	 Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.
51	Phoebe	 (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)
52	Chandler	 You really want to take me?
53	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
54	Chandler	 So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
55	Monica	 Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
56	Joey	 It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.
57	Chandler	 I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
58	Joey	 Thanks. That means a lot to me.
59		(They look at each other and smile for a while.)
60	Phoebe	 Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
61	Joey	 (in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)
62	Chandler	 (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
63	Rachel	 Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
64	Phoebe	 When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
65	Monica	 She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
66	Phoebe	 I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.
67	Monica	 Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.
68	Phoebe	 You’re on!
69	Monica	 Okay, how much?
70	Phoebe	 One hundred thousand dollars!
71	Monica	 How about fifty bucks?
72	Phoebe	 Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.
73	Rachel	 (calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!
74		(They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.)
75	Phoebe	 No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
76	[Scene	 The World Premiere of Over There, Joey and Chandler are arriving in a limo and are about to walk down the red carpet.]
77	Chandler	 This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
78	Joey	 A little tall.
79	Chandler	 What?
80	Joey	 Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
81	Chandler	 It’s just so glamorous.
82	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering, still pregnant.]
83	Phoebe	 Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
84	Rachel	 Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
85	Monica	 Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)
86	Phoebe	 It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
87	Monica	 Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
88	Phoebe	 Fine! You’re on!
89	Monica	 Okay.
90	Phoebe	 Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.
91	Ross	 (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
92	Monica	 She’s in the bathroom.
93	Ross	 Rach, we gotta go.
94	Rachel	 In a minute!!!
95	Ross	 People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.
96	Rachel	 (entering) All right, all right. Let’s go!
97	Ross	 Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…
98	Rachel	 No, I’m fine.
99	Ross	 Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. (She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
100	Phoebe	 Good God man don’t anger it.
101	Rachel	 Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
102	Ross	 Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
103	Rachel	 Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
104	Monica	 I’m actually with her on this one.
105	[Scene	 Inside Joey’s Premiere, he is intently watching the movie.]
106	Joey	 (onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
107	Joey	 (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up. (He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)
108	[Scene	 Dr. Long’s Office, Ross and Rachel are waiting for the doctor. Ross is drumming his fingers on the bed.]
109	Rachel	 Ross.
110	Ross	 Yeah?
111	Rachel	 Can I ask you something?
112	Ross	 Uh-huh.
113	Rachel	 When Carol was pregnant with Ben…
114	Ross	 Mmm?
115	Rachel	 …were you this irritating?
116	Ross	 Wow!
117	Rachel	 Excuse me?!
118	Ross	 Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
119	Rachel	 Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
120	Ross	 Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.
121	Rachel	 (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!
122	Ross	 Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
123		(Dr. Long enters.)
124	Rachel	 Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
125	Ross	 (to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her.
126	Rachel	 She has the drugs!
127	Dr. Long	 We’ll do a quick check.
128	Rachel	 Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
129	Dr. Long	 So, eight days late huh?
130	Rachel	 Yeah.
131	Dr. Long	 You must be a little uncomfortable.
132	Rachel	 Eh, just a tad.
133	Dr. Long	 You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
134	Ross	 Do them!!
135	Dr. Long	 Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective.
136	Rachel	 Well, we are ready to try anything.
137	Dr. Long	 Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink.
138	Rachel	 Okay.
139	Dr. Long	 You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…
140	Rachel	 Great! We will do all of those.
141	Dr. Long	 …taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’s proved most effective
142		(Rachel turns and looks at Ross.)
143	Ross	 You’ve got to be kidding me!
144		Commercial Break
145	[Scene	 Joey’s Premiere, the movie is ending and it takes the applause to wake up Chandler.]
146	Chandler	 Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
147	Joey	 You liked it? You really liked it?
148	Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
149	Joey	 Which part exactly?
150	Chandler	 The whole thing! Can we go?
151	Joey	 Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
152	Chandler	 I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
153	Joey	 Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
154	Chandler	 I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
155	Joey	 You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)
156	Chandler	 Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.
157	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Rachel are there as Phoebe and Monica enter.]
158	Monica	 Hey!
159	Ross	 Hey.
160	Rachel	 Hi!
161	Monica	 What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
162	Rachel	 No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
163	Ross	 Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
164	Rachel	 Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."
165	Monica	 Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
166	Ross	 It’s sex.
167	Monica	 Do it!
168	Ross	 Monica!
169	Monica	 I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
170	Phoebe	 Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
171	Monica	 All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!
172	Ross	 Monica, what is the matter with you?
173	Monica	 Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
174	Rachel	 Why? Why today?
175	Monica	 Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!
176	Ross	 What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
177	Rachel	 I’ll take that bet.
178	Ross	 What?!
179	Rachel	 Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
180	Ross	 Can I get some of that action?
181	Monica	 Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?
182	Rachel	 Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
183	Monica	 Oh, okay!
184		(Rachel turns her head to Ross and Phoebe and mouths, "No way.")
185	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is there as Joey enters.]
186	Joey	 Hey! Sleeping beauty!
187	Chandler	 Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
188	Joey	 (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
189	Chandler	 I’m so sorry.
190	Joey	 Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
191	Chandler	 What?!
192	Joey	 Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!
193	Chandler	 You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…
194	Joey	 Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
195	Chandler	 I don’t know, five hundred dollars?
196	Joey	 Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
197	Chandler	 Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
198	Joey	 Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)
199	Chandler	 Do you want a calculator?
200	Joey	 Please!
201	Chandler	 Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
202	Joey	 All right, what else?
203	Chandler	 Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…
204	Joey	 Which we’re still keeping under our hats!
205	Chandler	 Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
206	Joey	 What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The south will rise again man."
207	Chandler	 Yes, money well spent!
208	Joey	 Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
209	Chandler	 Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…
210	Joey	 Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
211	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are trying the home remedies again.]
212	Ross	 Come on, finish your enchilada.
213	Rachel	 Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
214	Ross	 Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
215	Rachel	 I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
216	Ross	 Stop it.
217	Rachel	 Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!
218	Ross	 I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.
219	Rachel	 Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
220	Ross	 This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.
221	Rachel	 Make love? What are you a girl?
222	Ross	 Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
223	Rachel	 But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
224	Ross	 I love when you talk dirty to me.
225	Rachel	 Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!
226	Ross	 Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
227	Rachel	 Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
228	Ross	 Y’know what?
229	Rachel	 What?!
230	Ross	 Forget it.
231	Rachel	 Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s not enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!
232	Ross	 I’m getting that baby out of you!
233		(They kiss again.)
234	Rachel	 (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
235	Ross	 Oh, I know.
236	Rachel	 Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
237	Ross	 I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
238	Rachel	 Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
239	Ross	 Hey!
240	Rachel	 Yeah.
241	Ross	 We’re having a baby.
242		(They hug and then kiss one more time.)
243	Rachel	 I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…
244	Ross	 Not so much.
245	Rachel	 Okay.
246		Closing Credits
247	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is paying Phoebe.]
248	Monica	 Two hundred.
249	Phoebe	 Thank you!
250	Monica	 That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no more betting.
251	Phoebe	 Okay.
252		(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
253	Monica	 Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.
254	Phoebe	 Is Rachel having the baby?
255	Monica	 How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey! Chandler!! It’s time!
256	Phoebe	 They’re at the coffeehouse.
257	Monica	 You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’s still not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl.
258	Phoebe	 We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)
259	Monica	 (following her) I’ll give you really good odds.
