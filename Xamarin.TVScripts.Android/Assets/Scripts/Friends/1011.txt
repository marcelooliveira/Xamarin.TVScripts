12	Ross	 Really? Which one?
13	Monica	 (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
14	Ross	 Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
15	Monica	 Oh, that was our favorite game show ever!
16	Ross	 Except for "Match game"...
17	Monica	 Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
18	Chandler	 What did I marry into?
19	Joey	 Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
20	Monica	 Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
21	Phoebe	 Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
22	Ross	 Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
23	Joey	 Seriously?
24	Ross	 (very excited) Yeah-uh!
25	Monica	 Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
26	Chandler	 You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
27	Monica	 Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
28	Rachel	 Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.

32		OPENING CREDITS
33	[Scene	 Class of '91 reunion. Ross and Chandler enter.] Ross
34	Chandler	 Who?
35	Ross	 He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
36	Chandler	 (looking around) Did I go to this school?
37	Ross	 Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
38	Chandler	 (looks over at her) Sure, nice.
39	Ross	 Dude. You're married to my sister.
40	Chandler	 You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
41	Ross	 Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
42	Chandler	 Are you asking permission to break the pact?
43	Ross	 Yes please.
44	[Flashback, year 1987. Chandler enters the school's corridor. Ross is hanging some flyers on the wall. Both have a funny 80s hair and clothes.] Ross	 Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
45	Chandler	 Awesome, the name really stands out.
46	Ross	 Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
47	Chandler	 Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
48	Missy	 Hey guys!
49	Chandler	 Hey!
50	Ross	 Hey, Missy...
51	Chandler	 You know, our band is playing on Friday.
52	Ross	 Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
53	Missy	 No way!
54	Chandler and Ross	 Way!
55	Missy	 Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)
56	Chandler	 Fresh!
57	Ross	 Boss!
58	Chandler	 Mint!
59	Ross	 She's gone.
60	Chandler	 I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
61	Ross	 Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
62	Chandler	 I said it first, bro.
63	Ross	 Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
64	Chandler	 (angrily) Look, if you did...
65	Ross	 Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
66	Chandler	 Totally. I had sex in High school...
67	Ross	 Me too. I'm good at it.
68	Chandler	 All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
69	Ross	 You got it.
70	Chandler	 All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
71	Ross	 Those are the pacts!
72	Chandler	 Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
73	Ross	 Oh, oh... maybe not you!
74	[We get back to the Class of '91 reunion, where Ross and Chandler are still looking at Missy.] Chandler	 Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
75	Ross	 Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
76	Chandler	 Your hands are shaking.
77	Ross	 I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)

(Joey's amazed at the place and he keeps looking around till he realizes the audience is applauding him)
80	Joey	 (to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.
81	Donny	 ...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson. (applause) Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?

83	Donny	 You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
84	Joey	 (on the screen there's the word "Supermarket") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, "notebook") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
85	Gene	 Diary.
86	Joey	 Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears

92	Rachel	 What?
93	Phoebe	 You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
94	Rachel	 Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
95	Phoebe	 Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!
96	Rachel	 Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
97	Phoebe	 Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of $1s in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
98	Rachel	 Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
99	[Scene	 Joey's at the game show "Pyramid" with host Donny Osmond.] Donny
100	Joey	 Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
101	Donny	 Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!

126	Joey	 Oh.
127	Donny	 Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
128	Joey	 Yeah...
129	Donny	 Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.
130	Stage Manager 	 And we're out!
131	Joey	 Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
132	Gene	 Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
133	Joey	 Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
134	Gene	 Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
135	Joey	 Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause) . Yeah!
136	[Scene	 College reunion party. Ross is talking to Missy.] Ross
137	Missy	 I'd love to!
138	Ross	 Great!
139	Missy	 So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
140	Ross	 Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
141	Missy	 Sure, he was in your "band"? (she air quotes band)
142	Ross	 It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
143	Missy	 Sorry.
144	Ross	 That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
145	Missy	 Really?
146	Ross	 Yeah, why?
147	Missy	 Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
148	Ross	 You did?
149	Missy	 Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
150	Ross	 (angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
151	[Scene	 Monica's apartment. The bachelorette party.] Monica
152	Rachel	 Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
153		(someone knocks at the door)
154	Monica	 Who is it?
155	Man	 It's the police!
156	Rachel	 (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
157	Phoebe	 (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!
158	Man	 That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
159	Monica	 What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
160	Roy, the male stripper	 (coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
161		COMMERCIAL BREAK
162	Roy	 Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
163	Monica	 Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
164	Roy	 Goodbody!
165	Monica	 ...If-you-say-so.
166	Roy	 So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
167	Phoebe	 Oh, God!
168	Roy	 All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right.
169	Phoebe	 Rachel?
170	Rachel	 Yeah?
171	Phoebe	 Are you kidding?
172	Rachel	 All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
173	Phoebe	 How old is your phonebook?
174	Monica	 Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
175	Phoebe	 Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
176	Roy	 Are you talking about me?
177	Monica	 Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
178	Roy	 Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
179		(he uses his remote to turn on the music, "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell, and starts dancing for Phoebe. He shakes his butt, moves his shoulders back, grabs his crotch and hops towards Phoebe. Phoebe is half horrified and half scared. He takes his hat off and throws it away, does some "Can Can" high kicks and swings his butt in front of Phoebe who looks at it in disgust. Then he tears open his shirt and shows her his chest and she flinches.)
180	Roy	 Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music) . She cringed!
181	Phoebe	 This is how I look when I'm turned on!
182	Roy	 You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
183	Phoebe	 Shocking!
184	Roy	 Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
185	Phoebe	 Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
186	Rachel	 No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
187	Phoebe	 No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
188	Roy	 Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
189	Phoebe	 I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
190	Roy	 Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
191	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
192	Roy	 I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin) ... is all man.
193	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
194	Roy	 (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!
195	Monica	 (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
196	Roy	 Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
197	[Scene	 At Pyramid. Joey is with the woman now.] Donny
198	Joey	 (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
199	Donny	 Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
200		(Camera goes to Joey. The clock is at 20 sec. The word "Legislature" appears. He looks at it blank faced and his eyes shift between Henrietta and his screen)
201	Joey	 Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word
202	Henrietta	 Uvula!
203	Joey	 Oh, then pass. (Next word
204	Donny	 O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)
205	[Scene	 Class of '91 reunion. Ross is walking angrily towards Chandler, who is talking to two other guys.] Ross
206		(Chandler looks at the other two guys, embarrassed)
207	Chandler	 (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them) . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
208	Ross	 You broke the pact!
209	Chandler	 Ross, that was 16 years ago!
210	Ross	 That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
211	Chandler	 I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
212	Ross	 I didn't.
213	Chandler	 Oh really?
214	Ross	 No.
215	Chandler	 Oh really!?
216	Ross	 NO!
217	Chandler	 ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
218	Adrienne	 Yes?
219	Chandler and Ross	 Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
220	Ross	 I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
221	Chandler	 Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
222	Ross	 I don't know what... you're talking about.
223	Chandler	 Really?
224	[Flashback scene	 80's College party.] Present Chandler's voice
225		(An 80's Rachel and fat Monica walk into the party room. Both with funny hairdos and clothes)
226	Monica	 I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
227	Rachel	 This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
228	Monica	 Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
229	Rachel	 I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
230	Monica	 Look, there's Chandler, you know, that stupid friend of Ross' who said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
231	Rachel	 It... You can so totally tell.
232	Monica	 I KNOW!
233	Rachel	 Well let's see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails) .
234	Chandler	 Aren't you...?
235	Rachel	 Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do) .
236	Chandler	 (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
237	Rachel	 Bitchin'
238	Chandler	 Hi Monica.
239	Monica	 Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
240	Chandler	 O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
241	Monica	 Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
242	Rachel	 Oh.
243	Monica	 Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
244		(Cut to Chandler. He's walking around looking for Ross. He sees him kissing a girl next to a vending machine)
245	Ross	 Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
246	Adrienne	 Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
247	Ross	 Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
248	[Scene	 We cut back to the present. The reunion where Chandler and Ross are talking.] Ross
249	Chandler	 Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song
250	Ross	 (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.
251	Chandler	 Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
252	Ross	 So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
253	Chandler	 (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
254	Ross	 We are even, right?
255	Chandler	 (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
256	Ross	 (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
257	Chandler	 Not her!
258	[Flashback scene	 We cut back to the 80's party. Rachel and Monica are "dancing".] Rachel
259	Monica	 That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
260	Chandler	 Soo... you girls having fun?
261	Monica	 For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)
262	Pizza guy	 SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
263	Monica	 Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
264	Rachel	 (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
265	Chandler	 Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
266	Rachel	 (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
267	Chandler	 Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
268	Rachel	 (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers "Oh my God!")
269	Chandler	 So where are you applying to?
270	Rachel	 Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
271	Chandler	 I'm in college and I'm in a band.
272	Rachel	 (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
273		
274	[Scene	 Monica's apartment. The stripper is sitting at the kitchen table. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe are standing around him] Roy
275	Phoebe	 You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
276	Roy	 No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
277	Rachel	 No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
278	Roy	 I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
279	Rachel	 So maybe something in an office.
280	Phoebe	 Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
281	Roy	 You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
282	Phoebe	 There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
283	Roy	 Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
284	Phoebe	 (after a pause) Finish it!
285	Roy	 What?
286	Phoebe	 Your last dance. Do it for us.
287	Roy	 Really?
288	Rachel	 (to Phoebe) Really?
289	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
290	Roy	 Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
291		(they sit down and Roy plays "You Make Me Feel" by Sylvester on his boom box, and starts... With his back towards the girls, he starts waving his hands, then backs towards the girls slapping his butt, then swings it around, and makes thrusting pelvic movements in front of Phoebe. He dances around the tables in between all the girls, and gets back into the kitchen part of the room. He then tears off one of his sleeves and throws it towards Monica and Rachel, who fight over who gets it. He then tears off his other sleeve and moves it back and forth between his legs, getting closer to Phoebe.)
292	Phoebe	 Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
293		(Roy then sits on Phoebe's lap, looking exhausted)
294	Phoebe	 Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
295	Roy	 (out of breath) Have to...
296		
297	[Scene	 The game show studio. Joey and Gene are sitting in the winner circle.] Donny
298	Joey	 (nervously) Yeah...
299	Gene	 (irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
300	Donny	 Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! (runs off)
301		(the screen says "6 to win" and "types of trees")
302	Gene	 Oak, maple, elm, birch...
303	Joey	 I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
304		(Joey hears the bell which means his answer is correct and is surprised. The screen now says "5 to win" and "Spanish words")
305	Gene	 Uhm... Buenos días, enchilada, por favor...
306	Joey	 (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
307		(There's the next bell, and the correct answer. The screen changes to "4 to win" and "things that burn". Gene now realizes that he got two correct answers and gets up in his seat.)
308	Gene	 A match, a candle...
309	Joey	 Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
310	Gene	 A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm, your pee...
311	Joey	 Things that burn.
312		(and another bell for the correct answer. "3 to win" and "What a dog might say")
313	Gene	 "I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
314	Joey	 Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
315	Gene	 Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark".
316	Joey	 Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
317		(the bell sounds again, "2 to win" and "pizza toppings")
318	Gene	 Pepperoni...

326	Joey	 Where? (looking around)
327	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's there and Ross and Chandler walk in.] Ross
328	Monica	 She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
329	Ross	 Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
330	Monica	 What? When was this?
331	Ross	 Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
332	Monica	 Oh my God! That's wild!
333	Chandler	 Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
334	Ross	 Well, it matters to me.
335	Chandler	 Why?
336	Ross	 Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
337	Chandler	 You kissed her that night too?
338	Monica	 Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
339	Chandler	 Seriously, where did this happen?
340	Ross	 Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
341	Chandler	 Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
342	Ross	 Mine.
343	Chandler	 I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
344	Ross	 No, she was definitely on my bed.
345	Chandler	 Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
346	Ross	 Well, then who was on my bed?
347	Monica	 (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
348	Ross	 (realizing) NO! No, no!
349	Monica	 YES! (Chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)
350	Ross	 You were under the pile of coats?
351	Monica	 I was the pile of coats!
352	Ross	 OH MY GOD!
353	Monica	 You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
354	Ross	 You were my first kiss with Rachel?
355	Monica	 You were my first kiss ever?
356	Chandler	 What did I marry into?
357	COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene	 Back at the party in 1987. People are dancing to "Disco Inferno" by The Trammps.] (Monica is dancing. At first she seems insecure and moves slowly, but then gets into the groove and swings her hips from side to side while holding her hands up. She then eats the last piece of pizza she was holding and again moves her hips from side to side, pushing her hands in the air in beat with the music. Her moves get more wildly while she's snapping her fingers. She loses balance and falls back onto a pink bean bag.)
358	Monica	 Oh, crap!
359		THE END
