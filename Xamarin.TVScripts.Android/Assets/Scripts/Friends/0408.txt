3	Joey	 (answering phone) Hello.
4	Chandler	 (on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
5		(Pause)
6		(The phone rings again.)
7	Joey	 (answering phone) Hello.
8	Chandler	 Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)
9		(Pause)
10		(The phone rings yet again.)
11	Joey	 (answering phone) Stop callin’!!
12	Voice	 (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
13	Joey	 All right!
14	Voice	 What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything… (Joey realizes it’s Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)
15		Opening Credits
16	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey and Chandler are there getting ready for Thanksgiving.]
17	Chandler	 (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
18	Phoebe	 Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!
19	Rachel	 So are things with you and Joey any better?
20	Chandler	 They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
21	Rachel	 Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
22	Ross	 Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
23	Rachel	 You shouldn’t.
24	Phoebe	 Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.
25	Ross	 Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.
26		[Cut to later, the gang, minus Joey, is watching the Thanksgiving Day parade.]
27	Rachel	 Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
28	Monica	 We haven’t eaten yet!
29	Rachel	 I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom.)
30	Chandler	 Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.
31	Phoebe	 I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
32	Chandler	 Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
33	Phoebe	 Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!
34	Chandler	 Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…
35	Phoebe	 Ohh.
36	Monica	 Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
37	Chandler	 Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
38	Monica	 Who cares? He works in a museum!
39	Chandler	 Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
40	Phoebe	 You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.
41	Chandler	 Thanks.
42	Monica	 What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!
43	Phoebe	 God, what happened?!
44	Monica	 Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
45	Rachel	 (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
46	Chandler	 Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
47	Phoebe	 Open it up, let me see.
48	Monica	 Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.
49	Chandler	 Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
50	Phoebe	 Ooh, God it looks bad.
51	Rachel	 Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
52	Monica	 No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!
53	Chandler	 He’s really picky about his patients.
54	Phoebe	 Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?
55	Monica	 Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
56	Phoebe	 (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
57	Monica	 Yes!!
58	Phoebe	 Yes! She’s very excited about that.
59		[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]
60	Phoebe	 This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)
61	Ross	 Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
62	Phoebe	 Okay, get out of my kitchen!
63	Chandler	 (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
64	Phoebe	 All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
65	Ross	 So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
66	Chandler	 Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
67	Ross	 Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?
68	Chandler	 I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
69	Ross	 Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
70	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
71	Ross	 Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
72	Chandler	 Like?
73	Ross	 Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
74	Chandler	 When was the last time you saw her wear it?
75	Ross	 Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…
76	Chandler	 Big dog?
77	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.]
78	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
79	Joey	 Hey!
80	Ross	 What are you doing?
81	Joey	 I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
82	Ross	 Everything? Even the TV?
83	Joey	 No! I’m putting that in my room.
84	Ross	 Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?
85	Joey	 Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
86	Ross	 That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
87	Joey	 Five years.
88	Ross	 You’ve sentenced him?!
89	Joey	 Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.
90	Ross	 Joey, the guy’s your best friend.
91	Joey	 No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.
92	Ross	 Oh, who? Me?
93	Joey	 Yeah!
94	Ross	 Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
95	Joey	 What?
96	Ross	 I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
97	Joey	 All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.
98	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are sitting at a table and talking about Joey.]
99	Kathy	 Oh my God, is it really that bad?
100	Chandler	 I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
101	Joey	 (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
102	Gunther	 I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
103		(Joey turns around and sees them kissing.)
104	Kathy	 Oh.
105	Chandler	 Hey Joe.
106	Joey	 (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
107	[Scene	 Dr. Burke’s office, Rachel and Monica are waiting as the doctor arrives.]
108	Doctor	 I’ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.
109	Monica	 Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
110	Rachel	 Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
111		(The intercom buzzes.)
112	Nurse	 Dr. Burke will see you know.
113	Monica	 Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
114	Nurse	 Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
115	Dr. Timothy Burke	 Ready?
116		(Monica looks at Rachel, who gives her the thumbs up.)
117	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is packing as Chandler rushes in.]
118	Chandler	 Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?
119	Joey	 My folks.
120	Chandler	 Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
121	Joey	 I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
122	Chandler	 What?!
123	Joey	 Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…
124	Chandler	 Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?
125	Joey	 Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)
126	Chandler	 Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
127	Joey	 Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.
128		(The chick and the duck walk into the living room.)
129	Chandler	 All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
130	Joey	 When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
131	Chandler	 What?
132	Joey	 Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!
133	Chandler	 All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
134	Joey	 We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
135		Commercial Break
136	[Scene	 Dr. Burke’s office, Tim is examining Monica.]
137	Tim	 Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
138	Monica	 I was probably waiting for it to open.
139	Tim	 I gotta tell you, you look great now.
140	Monica	 You look great too.
141	Tim	 You’re an excellent patient!
142	Monica	 So how does it look?
143	Tim	 Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
144	Monica	 Like a pirate?!
145	Tim	 If that helps you.
146	Monica	 Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.
147	Tim	 I moved back here a couple of months ago.
148	Monica	 Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
149	Tim	 Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)
150	Monica	 No way!
151	Tim	 I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s.
152	Monica	 (disappointed) Oh.
153	Tim	 But we broke up.
154	Monica	 (happy) Oh.
155	Tim	 She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment.
156	Monica	 (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
157	Tim	 You’re not wearing the patch yet.
158	Monica	 I know.
159	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, It’s closer to dinner. Monica has just told everyone that Tim is coming to dinner.]
160	Ross	 He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
161	Rachel	 I know, it’s sick.
162	Monica	 Why is it sick?
163	Rachel	 Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
164	Monica	 Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?
165	Phoebe	 Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.
166	Ross	 Yeah.
167	Joey	 (coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?
168	Monica	 Me going out with Richard’s son.
169	Joey	 Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
170	Chandler	 (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
171	Rachel	 Is he okay in there?
172	Joey	 He’s fine!
173	Ross	 Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
174	Monica	 Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)
175	Rachel	 So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
176	Joey	 Chandler?
177	Chandler	 The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!
178	Ross	 (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
179	Rachel	 (worried) Why?
180	Ross	 I just wanna check something.
181	Rachel	 Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
182	Ross	 (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll see.
183	Chandler	 Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
184	Rachel	 (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
185	Ross	 (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
186	Rachel	 Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
187	Ross	 Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
188	Rachel	 Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
189	Ross	 What did you get?
190	Rachel	 Credit.
191		(There’s a knock on the door.)
192	Monica	 (running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.
193	Tim	 Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)
194	Monica	 Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
195	Tim	 Hi, nice to meet you.
196	Monica	 And Joey.
197	Joey	 Hey!
198	Tim	 Hi, Joey.
199	Monica	 My brother, Ross.
200	Ross	 Hey.
201	Monica	 And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.
202	Chandler	 How do ya do.
203	Tim	 What’s…
204	Monica	 Umm, well, he’s…
205	Joey	 He’s doin’ some thinkin’!
206		[cut to later, Joey, Rachel, Ross, and Tim are watching the football game, and they all cheer loudly.]
207	Chandler	 What happened? What happened?!
208	Joey	 You kissed my girlfriend!
209		(A commercial for sunglasses comes on.)
210	Rachel	 Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
211	Ross	 Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?
212	Rachel	 (Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)
213	Monica	 All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
214	Tim	 Where can I wash up?
215	Monica	 Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
216	Tim	 Thank you.
217	Rachel	 Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!
218	Monica	 See he’s nice. Right?
219	Phoebe	 Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That’s not how your dad used to do it."
220	Tim	 Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
221	Monica	 I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
222	Rachel	 (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
223		(There’s a loud knocking.)
224	Phoebe	 Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)
225	Chandler	 Gotcha! (laughs)
226	Joey	 That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!
227	Chandler	 Sorry!
228	Joey	 Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
229	Chandler	 Okay, okay, you got it!
230	Rachel	 Ross, can you pass me the yams?
231	Ross	 Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
232	Rachel	 Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
233	Monica	 Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.
234	Ross	 There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
235	Rachel	 Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
236		(an awkward silence follows)
237	Chandler	 You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
238	Joey	 All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!
239	Chandler	 You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.
240	Joey	 So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
241	Chandler	 Absolutely!
242	Joey	 That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay.
243		(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)
244	Rachel	 Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
245	Ross	 I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
246		(Rachel glares at him.)
247		[Cut to the balcony with Monica and Tim.]
248	Monica	 (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)
249	Tim	 Here, let me help. (Does so.)
250	Monica	 Thank you.
251	Tim	 You-you have a very beautiful… eye.
252	Monica	 Y’know all my friends think this is weird.
253	Tim	 Y’know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn’t.
254	Monica	 I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.
255	Tim	 Oh, I totally agree.
256	Monica	 We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
257		(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica pulls away.)
258	Tim	 What?
259	Monica	 Nothing. Nothing.
260	Tim	 No-no really, was-was that not okay?
261	Monica	 No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…
262	Tim	 Oh my God! It didn’t remind you of…
263	Monica	 (interrupting) Don’t say it!
264	Tim	 No, but it did! Didn’t it?!
265	Monica	 Yeah!
266	Tim	 Oh man!!
267	Monica	 I know!
268		(They both shiver in horror.)
269		[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. There’s a knock on the door.]
270	Joey	 I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.)
271	Kathy	 (sees it’s Joey) Oh.
272	Joey	 Hey.
273	Kathy	 Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am…
274	Joey	 That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.
275	Kathy	 Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?
276	Joey	 In the box.
277	Kathy	 (going over to the box) Chandler?
278	Phoebe	 Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.
279	Kathy	 Why not? What’s going on?
280	Phoebe	 He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
281	Kathy	 By being in a box?
282	Rachel	 Joey, had reasons.
283	Phoebe	 They were threefold.
284	Kathy	 Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm… (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint and leave them alone.) Listen I don’t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore. I’m gonna go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best. Y’know? I’m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
285		(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves good-bye with one finger extended through the air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)
286	Joey	 (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
287	Rachel	 What?!
288	Joey	 He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!
289	Chandler	 So?
290	Joey	 Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!
291	Chandler	 Yeah?
292	Joey	 Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.
293	Chandler	 Man, this is…
294		(Joey says something unintelligible and they hug.)
295	Joey	 Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)
296		(After he’s gone.)
297	Joey	 All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.
298		Closing Credits
299	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's Balcony, the gang is all there watching Chandler.]
300	Rachel	 Oh, he sees her!
301	Monica	 Oh, he’s catching up to her!
302	Phoebe	 Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!
303	Ross	 He’s taking her purse!
304	Joey	 Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.
305	Phoebe	 Oh, there they are!
306		(They watch them making up and sigh)
307	Phoebe	 All right, get a room.
308		End
