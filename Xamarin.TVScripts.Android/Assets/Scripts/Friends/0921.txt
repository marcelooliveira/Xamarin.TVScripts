1	Teleplay	 Robert Carlock Story
2	[Scene	 Central Perk]
3	Monica	 It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
4	Ross	 Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
5	Chandler	 I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
6	Ross	 Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
7	Rachel	 I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
8	Ross	 Why do you care so much?
9	Monica	 Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
10	Rachel	 (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
11	Ross	 Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
12	Phoebe	 Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
13	Rachel	 All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
14	Ross	 Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
15		(Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her)
16	Ross	 Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
17	Joey	 Hey!
18	All	 Hi!
19	Ross	 I'm gonna get some more coffee.
20	Charlie	 Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
21	Ross	 Ok. (they both go)
22	Chandler	 (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
23	Joey	 Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?
24	Charlie	 (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
25	Ross	 Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
26	Charlie	 You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
27	Ross	 Yeah, I know the type.
28	Joey	 Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
29		Opening credits
30	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment]
31	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
32	Monica	 Hey!
33	Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
34	Rachel	 Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
35	Phoebe	 I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
36	Rachel	 (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
37	Phoebe	 Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
38	Monica	 Hey, what's this?
39	Rachel	 Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
40	Monica	 Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
41	Rachel	 Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
42	Monica	 Do you wanna go hunting?
43	Rachel	 Well, I would like to have the option!!
44	Phoebe	 (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!
45	Rachel	 Oh!
46	Phoebe	 No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
47	Monica	 And she wants to go hunting, too!!
48	Rachel	 Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
49	Phoebe	 Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
50	Rachel	 I don't care about any of that!!
51	Phoebe	 Well, do you care about friendship?
52	Rachel	 Oh!
53	Phoebe	 I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
54	Rachel	 Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
55	Phoebe	 Promise?
56	Rachel	 I promise.
57	Phoebe	 Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
58	Rachel	 But I am going hunting!!
59	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment]
60	Monica	 (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
61	Chandler	 Oh, yeah?
62	Monica	 Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
63	Chandler	 Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
64	Monica	 Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
65	Chandler	 We really need to take those tests?
66	Monica	 Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
67	Chandler	 But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
68	Monica	 What is the big deal?
69	Chandler	 It's weird! In a doctor's office?
70	Monica	 It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
71	Chandler	 (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
72	Monica	 Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
73	Chandler	 Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
74	Monica	 (really embarrassed) OH!
75	Chandler	 Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
76	[Scene	 Joey's apartment]
77	Joey	 (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
78		(somebody knocks the door, Joey opens and it's Charlie)
79	Joey	 Heeey!
80	Charlie	 Hi!
81	Joey	 Come on in, how are ya?
82	Charlie	 I'm good!
83	Joey	 Can I offer you a drink?
84	Charlie	 Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...
85	Joey	 Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
86	Charlie	 So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
87	Joey	 Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
88	Charlie	 Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
89	Joey	 Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
90	Charlie	 Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
91	Joey	 (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
92	Charlie	 And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
93	Joey	 I know, yeah!
94	Charlie	 And first, I have to see the MET!
95	Joey	 Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
96	Charlie	 No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
97	Joey	 Which one, they all suck!
98	Charlie	 The museum!
99	Joey	 (looking puzzled) I don't think so.
100	[Scene	 SPA massage center, Rachel enters]
101	Rachel	 (to the receptionist) Hi there!
102	Receptionist	 (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
103	Rachel	 Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
104	Receptionist	 This has been torn up.
105	Rachel	 And... taped back together.
106	Receptionist	 Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
107	Rachel	 Ok
108	Receptionist	 Have a seat through the glass doors.
109	Rachel	 (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
110	Receptionist	 Through the glass doors.
111	Rachel	 Alright-y then.
112		(Phoebe enters the hall)
113	Receptionist	 Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
114	Phoebe	 Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
115	Receptionist	 Sorry, everyone is booked!
116	Phoebe	 But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
117	Receptionist	 Then why you work here?
118	Phoebe	 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
119	Receptionist	 Well, I think this is a great place to work!
120	Phoebe	 (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?
121	[Scene	 Central Perk]
122		(Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa)
123	Joey	 Ross!
124	Ross	 Hi!
125	Joey	 I need to talk to you about Charlie.
126	Ross	 (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
127	Joey	 Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
128	Ross	 Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
129	Joey	 No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
130	Ross	 Get to the problem!
131	Joey	 Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
132	Ross	 (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
133	Joey	 (checking) EH, what do you know!
134	Ross	 You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
135	Joey	 Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
136	Ross	 You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
137	Joey	 Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
138	Ross	 (after a short hesitation) Fine.
139	Joey	 Thanks.
140	Ross	 Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
141	Joey	 The Metsss!
142	Ross	 Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
143	Joey	 (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
144	Ross	 Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
145	Joey	 Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
146	Ross	 Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
147	Joey	 Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
148	Ross	 But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
149	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
150	Ross	 Ok.
151	Joey	 You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
152	Ross	 Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
153	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)
154	[Scene	 doctor's waiting room]
155	Chandler	 I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
156	Monica	 Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
157		(a nurse walks in)
158	Nurse	 Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
159	Chandler	 Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
160	Monica	 Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
161	Chandler	 Yeah, I guess!
162	Monica	 I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
163	Janice	 OH MY GOD!!
164	Chandler	 Oh, Come on!
165		Commercial Break
166	Janice	 Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
167	Monica	 Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
168	Chandler	 Why are you here?
169	Janice	 Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
170	Chandler	 (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
171	Janice	 Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking at the cup in his hand).
172	Chandler	 What!?
173		(Janice does her "Janice Laugh")
174	Monica	 This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
175	Chandler	 I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
176	Janice	 Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you need a hand!
177	Chandler	 (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
178	[Scene	 At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door]
179	Phoebe	 (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
180	Rachel	 Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)
181	Phoebe	 Okay, then I'm Swedish...
182	Monica	 So, what's your name?
183	Phoebe	 It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
184	Rachel	 Oh... what an interesting name.
185	Phoebe	 Ja!
186	Rachel	 You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction)
187	Phoebe	 (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
188	Rachel	 (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)
189	Phoebe	 Is something wrong?
190	Rachel	 No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
191	Phoebe	 (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
192	Rachel	 Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
193	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room, rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum]
194	Joey	 (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
195	Ross	 Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
196	Joey	 (shaking his head as if to say
197	Ross	 Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
198	Joey	 Phonetically? (Looks confused)
199	Ross	 Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
200	Joey	 Ok.
201	Ross	 Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
202	Joey	 Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
203	Ross	 Wow. What does that mean?
204	Joey	 No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
205	Ross	 Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
206	Joey	 Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).
207	Ross	 Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
208	Joey	 Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
209	Ross	 No! (Slaps his hand)
210	[Scene	 The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms]
211	Chandler	 (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
212	Janice	 Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
213	Chandler	 Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
214	Janice	 That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
215	Chandler	 I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
216	Janice	 Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
217	Chandler	 (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
218	Janice	 Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
219	Chandler	 (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
220	Janice	 What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
221	Chandler	 (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!! "
222	[Scene	 Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging Rachel]
223	Phoebe	 (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
224	Rachel	 Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
225	Phoebe	 Oh, Ja! Ja!
226	Rachel	 Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
227	Phoebe	 Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
228	Rachel	 I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
229	Phoebe	 Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
230	Rachel	 (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
231	Phoebe	 You know it's me?
232	Rachel	 For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
233	Phoebe	 How can you come here?
234	Rachel	 How could you not tell me you worked here?
235	Phoebe	 I don't have to tell you everything!
236	Rachel	 Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
237	Phoebe	 Tips not included.
238	Rachel	 Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
239	Phoebe	 Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
240	Rachel	 Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
241	Phoebe	 You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
242	Rachel	 Good for you Pheebs!
243	Phoebe	 Ok.
244	Phoebe	 Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
245	[Scene	 Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on his laptop]
246	Ross	 Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
247		(Charlie walks in.)
248	Ross	 (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
249	Charlie	 Hi!
250	Ross	 Hey, how was the Met?
251	Charlie	 The museum was amazing!
252	Ross	 Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
253	Charlie	 Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
254	Ross	 What do you mean?
255	Charlie	 Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
256	Ross	 (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
257	Charlie	 No, we went to the left.
258	Ross	 (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
259	Charlie	 Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).
260	Ross	 What?
261	Charlie	 Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
262	Ross	 What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
263	Charlie	 Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
264	Ross	 (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
265	Charlie	 Yeah, I guess that's true.
266	Ross	 And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
267	Charlie	 He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
268	Ross	 That was going to be my next argument.
269		(Joey walks in)
270	Joey	 Hey!
271	Ross	 Hey!
272	Charlie	 Hey!
273	Joey	 (to Charlie) You're ready?
274	Charlie	 Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks Ross.
275	Joey	 (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
276	Ross	 Glad I could help man.
277	Joey	 Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
278	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper.]
279	Chandler	 (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
280		(phone rings)
281	Chandler	 Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
282		(Monica walks in)
283	Monica	 Hey sweetie.
284	Chandler	 Doctor Connelly just called.
285	Monica	 With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
286	Chandler	 Actually it's both of us.
287	Monica	 What?
288	Chandler	 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
289	Monica	 Oh... what does that mean?
290	Chandler	 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...
291	Monica	 Chandler?
292	Chandler	 (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
293	Monica	 (weeping) Oh my God!
294	Chandler	 I'm sorry.
295	Monica	 I'm sorry too.
296		(they hug)
297	Chandler	 Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
298	Monica	 (still weeping) I know.
299		Closing credits
300	[Scene	 The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in]
301	Receptionist	 Good morning Phoebe.
302	Phoebe	 (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
303	Receptionist	 Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.
304	Phoebe	 Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?
305		(Phoebe walks to the door and half-opens it)
306	Phoebe	 (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
307		End
