4	Phoebe	 Hey!
5	Monica	 Hey how was dinner?!
6	Phoebe	 Dinner was good!
7	Monica	 Okay!
8	Phoebe	 I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!
9	Monica	 Okay!
10		(Phoebe turns to leave but notices an attractive man.)
11	Phoebe	 (To him) Oh, well hello there.
12	Guy	 Hi.
13	Phoebe	 (To Monica) I didn’t see this on the menu.
14	Monica	 Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
15	Phoebe	 Oh, so you're Monica’s boss?
16	Tim	 Actually she’s my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
17	Phoebe	 Oh! I sous stand.
18	Monica	 Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
19	Tim	 Yeah.
20	Phoebe	 Oh you…you made pesto?
21	Tim	 Yes I did.
22	Phoebe	 Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
23	Tim	 I…I-I don’t know, but I would say it’s pretty good-o. (Phoebe laughs too hard.)
24		(Monica goes over and grabs the pesto.)
25	Monica	 All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
26	Tim	 I like your necklace.
27	Phoebe	 I made it myself.
28	Tim	 You are so talented.
29	Phoebe	 Well, it’s no pesto.
30	Monica	 All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? (To Phoebe) You’re single. (To Tim) You’re single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at eleven. (To Tim) She’ll be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
31		Opening Credits
32	[Scene	 Chandler’s Office, he’s working at his computer as his boss, Mr. Franklin, sticks his head in.]
33	Mr. Franklin	 Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
34	Chandler	 You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
35	Mr. Franklin	 You’re a joker Bing. (Walks away.)
36	Chandler	 What’s funny about that?
37	Ross	 (running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
38	Chandler	 Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?
39	Ross	 Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
40	Chandler	 The Hard Rock Caf�?
41	Ross	 Yeah!
42	Chandler	 Again?!
43	Ross	 Yeah!!
44		(They go out to the elevators.)
45	Ross	 I’m telling you, I like the food!
46	Chandler	 You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
47	Bob	 Hey Toby! Have a good night. (Walks by.)
48	Ross	 Did that guy just call you Toby?
49	Chandler	 Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.
50	Ross	 Well, why don’t you correct him?
51	Chandler	 Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.
52	Ross	 Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
53	Chandler	 No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
54	Ross	 (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
55	Chandler	 Shh! It is a family name!
56	Ross	 Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
57	[Scene	 Days Of Our Lives set, Joey is doing a scene with a co-star as Rachel watches on a monitor.]
58	Joey's Co-Star	 Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
59	Dr. Drake Ramoray	 What is it?
60	Joey's Co-Star	 Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain.
61	Dr. Drake Ramoray	 Is it serious?
62	Joey's Co-Star	 Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
63	Dr. Drake Ramoray	 Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that.
64	Joey's Co-Star	 We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.
65		(Dramatic music plays and Joey does a little ‘Smell-the-fart’ acting.)
66	Director	 Cut! Very nice people!
67	Joey	 (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
68	Rachel	 Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!
69	Joey	 I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!
70	Rachel	 You don’t know do you?
71	Joey	 No, couldn’t care less.
72	Joey's Co-Star	 Hey good scene man.
73	Joey	 Hey you too!
74	Joey's Co-Star	 Alright.
75		(Rachel clears her throat.)
76	Joey	 What? You weren’t in it.
77	Rachel	 Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)
78	Joey	 Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
79	Kash	 Yes?
80	Joey	 This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
81	Rachel	 Hi.
82	Kash	 Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before?
83	Rachel	 Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts stroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm.
84	Joey	 (grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from Kash.)
85	Rachel	 Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash.
86	Kash	 Bye.
87	Rachel	 Say hi to Wally.
88	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is getting coffee as Phoebe enters.]
89	Phoebe	 Ooh Monica!
90	Monica	 Hi!
91	Phoebe	 Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.
92	Monica	 I…I have to fire him.
93	Phoebe	 But why?!
94	Monica	 Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
95	Phoebe	 Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
96	Monica	 Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
97	Phoebe	 But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
98	Monica	 (thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
99	Phoebe	 That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
100	Monica	 I paid to have this done.
101	Phoebe	 Love it!
102	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating at the counter as Joey enters.]
103	Joey	 Hey!
104	Rachel	 Hi!
105	Joey	 Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
106	Rachel	 I thought I was a complete idiot.
107	Joey	 Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.
108	Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
109	Joey	 I said no.
110	Rachel	 What?!
111	Joey	 What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.
112	Rachel	 Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
113	Joey	 I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
114	Rachel	 Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?
115	Joey	 Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…
116	Rachel	 Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!
117	[Scene	 Chandler’s Office Building, Chandler is walking by the elevators and sees Bob standing there.]
118	Chandler	 Hey Bob.
119	Bob	 Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?
120	Chandler	 If I see him, I’ll ask.
121	Bob	 (laughs) Toby!
122		(The elevator doors opens, Bob boards the elevator, Chandler walks away, and Mr. Franklin steps out of the elevator.)
123	Mr. Franklin	 Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
124	Chandler	 Yeah!
125	Mr. Franklin	 Oh then you know each other.
126	Chandler	 We’re on a semi-first name basis.
127	Mr. Franklin	 What do you think of adding him to our team?
128	Chandler	 Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.
129	Mr. Franklin	 Really? They love him down on six.
130	Chandler	 But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
131	Mr. Franklin	 Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
132	Chandler	 I think it’s best sir.
133	Mr. Franklin	 But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds his hand at shoulder level.)
134	Chandler	 Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.
135	Mr. Franklin	 (laughs) That’s a good one. (Walks away.)
136	Chandler	 What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
137	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is in the kitchen as Phoebe enters.]
138	Phoebe	 Hey!
139	Monica	 Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
140	Phoebe	 But…
141	Monica	 No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
142	Phoebe	 Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.
143	Monica	 Why not?!
144	Phoebe	 Because I’m dumping him today.
145	Monica	 What?! You said he was sweet!
146	Phoebe	 He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
147	Monica	 Just don’t pick up your phone.
148	Phoebe	 Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
149	Monica	 What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
150	Phoebe	 You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.
151	Monica	 Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
152	Phoebe	 Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!
153	Monica	 Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!
154	Phoebe	 Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
155	Monica	 What do you mean?
156	Phoebe	 Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!
157	Monica	 I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
158	Phoebe	 All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)
159	[Scene	 Chandler’s Office Building, Bob is standing at the elevators and sees Chandler walk up.]
160	Bob	 Hey Toby, you got a sec?
161	Chandler	 Sure, what’s up?
162	Bob	 I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
163	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her date and Joey is reading a magazine.]
164	Rachel	 Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?"
165	Ross	 (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
166	Rachel	 Hi!
167	Joey	 Hey!
168	Ross	 So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
169	Joey	 No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.
170	Ross	 Rach? You wanna come?
171	Rachel	 Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.
172	Ross	 A date?
173	Rachel	 Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
174	Ross	 Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.
175	Joey	 It’s no Ukrainian film.
176	Rachel	 Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
177	Ross	 A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
178	Joey	 I set her up with this actor on my show.
179	Ross	 You set her up?!
180	Joey	 No
181	Ross	 Joey what-what were you thinking?!
182	Joey	 Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!
183	Ross	 Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
184	Joey	 Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
185	Ross	 A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
186	Joey	 Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
187	Ross	 Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!
188		(There’s a knock on the door and Joey answers it.)
189	Kash	 Hey Joey.
190	Joey	 Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
191	Kash	 Hey.
192	Ross	 Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
193	Kash	 Yeah.
194	Ross	 A bit of a daredevil are we?
195	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!
196	Kash	 Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
197	Rachel	 Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.
198	Ross	 Okay. Have a great time you guys.
199	Rachel	 Thank you.
200	Kash	 Thank you.
201	Ross	 Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
202		Commercial Break
203	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is reading a magazine as Tim enters.]
204	Tim	 (walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)
205	Phoebe	 Hi.
206	Tim	 Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
207	Phoebe	 It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.
208	Tim	 It’s because I’m with you.
209	Phoebe	 Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
210		(Tim’s beeper goes off and he answers it.)
211	Tim	 Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebe fake laughs.) Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. (Starts to leave.)
212	Phoebe	 Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
213	Tim	 Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. (Starts to leave) And I will be holding you, right here. (Holds his hands over his heart, blows a kiss to Phoebe who catches it, and then leaves and Phoebe throws the kiss back.)
214	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are having dinner.]
215	Joey	 So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
216	Ross	 Books?
217	Joey	 All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!
218	Ross	 Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.
219	Joey	 And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
220	Ross	 Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
221	Joey	 Dude! What is going on?!
222	Ross	 I just…I have to find out how it went.
223	Joey	 Why?
224	Ross	 This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
225	Joey	 They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!
226	Ross	 I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
227	Joey	 Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
228	Ross	 I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
229	Joey	 What do you mean?
230	Ross	 It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
231	Joey	 That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
232	Ross	 No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
233	Joey	 Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
234	Ross	 It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
235	Joey	 Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.
236	Ross	 No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
237	Joey	 I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.
238	Ross	 No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
239	Joey	 That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
240	Ross	 Yeah.
241	Joey	 Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
242	Ross	 (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
243	Joey	 No, I said fun!
244	[Scene	 Outside Chandler’s Office, Chandler is just about to go into his office when Bob calls for him from behind.]
245	Bob	 Hey Toby!
246	Chandler	 Hey Bobby.
247	Bob	 It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is?
248	Chandler	 Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
249	Bob	 I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
250	Chandler	 Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.
251	Bob	 Toby don’t.
252	Chandler	 Bob!
253	Bob	 Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
254	Chandler	 Well that puts me in a difficult position.
255	[Scene	 Monica’s Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is waiting for Tim who enters.]
256	Monica	 Hey.
257	Tim	 I got your page, is everything okay?
258	Monica	 Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
259	Tim	 Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
260	Monica	 Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. (Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!
261	Phoebe	 Monica!
262	Monica	 (simultaneously) You’re fired!
263	Phoebe	 (simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!
264	Tim	 What?
265	Phoebe	 I’m, I’m breaking up with you.
266	Monica	 You’re fired.
267	Tim	 Why?
268	Phoebe	 I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.
269	Monica	 Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.
270	Phoebe	 Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.
271	Tim	 Wow! Umm, okay. Umm… (To Phoebe) I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it’s only because I think you’re so amazing. (To Monica) And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I—you’re the most talented chef I’ve ever worked for. Anyway… (Starts to leave and Phoebe and Monica trade looks.)
272	Monica	 Tim wait!
273	Tim	 Yeah?
274	Monica	 Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
275	Tim	 Really?
276	Monica	 Yeah.
277	Tim	 Thank you so much! ‘Cause I-I know I can do better!
278	Monica	 Okay.
279		(They both look at Phoebe.)
280	Phoebe	 And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts Monica.)
281	[Scene	 A Street, Ross is walking past a newsstand and sees Rachel.]
282	Ross	 Hello.
283	Rachel	 Hi!
284	Ross	 Well, how was the date?
285	Rachel	 Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
286	Ross	 Uh-huh. What happened?
287	Rachel	 I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
288	Ross	 Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?
289	Rachel	 Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.
290	Ross	 Oh?
291	Rachel	 He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
292	Ross	 He sounds swell.
293	Rachel	 Doesn’t he?
294	Ross	 Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?
295	Rachel	 Yes.
296	Ross	 Sit down.
297	Rachel	 Okay.
298		(They sit on some front steps.)
299	Ross	 Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
300	Rachel	 (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?
301	Ross	 Yeah-ha!
302	Rachel	 Oh my God. (Laughs)
303	Ross	 I’m sorry about your date.
304	Rachel	 Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.
305	Ross	 Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
306	Rachel	 Thanks sweetie.
307	Ross	 You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
308	Rachel	 Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
309	Ross	 Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
310	Rachel	 Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
311	Ross	 Right. Good night.
312	Rachel	 Good night.
313		(He kisses her on the cheek and heads to Central Perk.)
314	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is entering and Mona from the wedding recognizes him.]

316	Ross	 Yeah?
317	Mona	 Hey it’s Mona! From the wedding.
318	Ross	 Oh hi!
319	Mona	 Hi!
320	Ross	 Wow! Uh…how are you?
321	Mona	 I’m good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
322	Ross	 Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
323	Mona	 (laughs then stops) Oh you’re serious. Sure!
324	Ross	 Great! Well umm…
325		(Ross continues to talk to her as the camera pans to show Rachel standing in the doorway.)
326	Mona	 I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
327	Ross	 Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
328	Mona	 Okay.
329		(Rachel watches that and slowly backs out to head for home.)
