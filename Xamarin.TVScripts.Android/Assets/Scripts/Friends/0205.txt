2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are there. Ross is watching wrestling.]
3	Ross	 Man, I sure miss Julie.
4	Chandler	 Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (The phone rings and Chandler doesn't answer it.)
5	Ross	 You ever figure out what that thing's for?
6	Chandler	 No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
7	Machine	 (Joey's voice) Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
8	Woman's Voice	 Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
9	Chandler	 What?
10	Jade	 I got a little drunk...and naked.
11	Chandler	 (answering the phone, in a deep voice) Bob here.
12		Opening Credits
13	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, continued from earlier. Ross and Chandler are dancing.]
14	Chandler	 (on phone) What've you been up to?
15	Jade	 Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. (They stop dancing.)
16	Chandler	 Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (To Ross) I love her.
17	Ross	 I know.
18	Chandler	 (on phone) I'm back.
19	Jade	 So, are we gonna get together or what?
20	Chandler	 Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
21	Jade	 Great, I'll see you then.
22	Chandler	 Ok. (He hangs up.) Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
23	Ross	 Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
24	Chandler	 I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
25	Ross	 Oh my god. You are pure evil.
26	Chandler	 Ok, pure evil (holds up his left hand), horny and alone (holds up his right hand). I've done this (He shakes his right hand.)
27	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there and Ross is on the phone.]
28	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
29	All	 Hi, Julie!
30	Rachel	 (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.
31	Chandler	 Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
32	Phoebe	 Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? Y'know, like from, like 20?
33	Chandler	 Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
34	Joey	 Do we need a cake?
35	Chandler	 Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
36	Rachel	 Yeah, whoosh! (Imitates going over a cliff with her hand.)
37	Chandler	 But it's Ross.
38	Phoebe	 It's Ross.
39	Joey	 Yeah, you're right.
40	Chandler	 I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
41	Ross	 Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. (He hangs up) (To Chandler) Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
42	Chandler	 You know, I think I might just.
43		(They exit.)
44	Rachel	 So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
45	Joey	 Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
46	Phoebe	 Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
47	Rachel	 Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
48	Joey	 Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
49	Phoebe	 Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, y'know, someplace nice, y'know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
50	Joey	 For Ross.
51	Rachel	 For Ross, Ross, Ross.
52	Monica	 (entering) Oh my god.
53	Rachel	 Hey.
54	Joey	 Hi.
55	Rachel	 What?
56	Monica	 I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
57	Joey	 If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
58	Monica	 Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. Y'know, someplace nice. (She goes into her bedroom.)
59	Joey	 (to Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, someplace nice.
60	Rachel	 Yeah!
61	Joey	 How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
62	[Scene	 Central Perk, Jade is waiting for Bob to show while Ross and Chandler look on.]
63	Ross	 I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
64	Chandler	 Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
65	Ross	 That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
66	Chandler	 We don't know Bob! Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
67	Ross	 Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
68	Chandler	 All right. (He gets up, but swings around the pole back to their table.)
69	Ross	 Go.
70		(He walks over to Jade.)
71	Chandler	 Hi.
72	Jade	 Hi.
73	Chandler	 Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
74	Jade	 Yes?
75	Chandler	 Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
76	Jade	 How did you...
77	Chandler	 I don't know. (He sits down.) I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? (Holds out one of this small packs.)
78	Jade	 Thanks.
79	Chandler	 No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
80		(He looks over at Ross who glares at him.)
81	[Scene	 A Restaurant, everyone except Chandler is seated at a table.]
82	Ross	 Ok, (holding up his glass) ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef...
83	Monica	 Who is also in charge of purchasing.
84	Ross	 Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing...
85	Monica	 Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
86	Ross	 Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
87	Monica	 Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
88	Joey	 Cool.
89	Phoebe	 Let's see!
90	Ross	 That's fine, I'll-I'll just wait!
91	Monica	 Oh, sorry.
92	Joey	 Sorry, sorry.
93	Ross	 Monica!
94		(They clink their glasses.)
95	Waiter	 Are we ready to order?
96	Rachel	 Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
97	Waiter	 Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
98	Phoebe	 (to Joey and Rachel) Wow, look at these prices.
99	Rachel	 Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
100	Joey	 What are these, like famous chickens?
101	Chandler	 Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
102	Ross	 (to Chandler behind their menus) Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
103	Chandler	 Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
104	Ross	 Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
105	Waiter	 Do I dare ask?
106	Monica	 Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
107	Ross	 That sounds great. Same for me.
108	Waiter	 And for the gentleman?
109	Joey	 Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
110	Waiter	 You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
111	Rachel	 Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.
112	Waiter	 (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?
113	Rachel	 Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
114	Waiter	 And for you?
115	Phoebe	 Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
116	Chandler	 I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
117	Waiter	 Anything else?
118	Chandler	 Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
119		[Time lapse, everyone has finished dinner and Ross is figuring out the bill.]
120	Ross	 (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
121	Chandler	 Okay.
122	Rachel	 Um, everyone?
123	Ross	 Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
124	Joey	 Thank you.
125	Ross	 Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
126	Monica	 Oh, thank you!
127	Ross	 So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
128	Phoebe	 No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
129	Chandler	 Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
130	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that-that-that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
131	Ross	 Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
132	Phoebe	 Not for you.
133	Monica	 All right, what's goin' on?
134	Rachel	 (to Joey and Phoebe) Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
135	Phoebe	 Fine. All right, fine.
136	Joey	 Yeah.
137	Chandler	 You can tell us.
138	Ross	 Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
139	Monica	 Yeah!
140	Joey	 (clearing his throat a lot) Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh... (Pause) We don't have as much money as you.
141	Monica	 Ok.
142	Ross	 I hear ya.
143	Chandler	 We can talk about that.
144	Phoebe	 Well, then...Let's.
145	Ross	 Well umm I, I just never think of money as an issue.
146	Rachel	 That's 'cause you have it.
147	Ross	 That's a good point.
148	Chandler	 So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
149	Joey	 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like with Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
150	Ross	 Wha—Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative—there's gonna be a hoopla?
151	Rachel	 Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
152	Monica	 If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
153	Ross	 G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
154	Chandler	 No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
155	Ross	 Hootie and the—oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
156	Phoebe	 No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
157	Ross	 No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
158	Monica	 All of us.
159	Chandler	 Together.
160	Ross	 Not at the concert.
161	Rachel	 Ok.
162	Joey	 Yeah.
163	Rachel	 Thank you.
164	Joey	 Thanks.
165	Phoebe	 Yeah.
166		(An awkward silence ensues.)
167	Chandler	 So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
168		Commercial Break
169	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting in the living room as Monica, who's holding a bag, Ross, and Chandler stand before them.]
170	Chandler	 Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
171	Monica	 I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
172	Phoebe	 Oh, it's like a skit.
173	Monica	 Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
174	Ross	 Whoo!
175	Phoebe	 Cool.
176	Monica	 Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you.
177	Ross	 But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
178	Chandler	 (to the others) By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
179	Ross	 Come on.
180	Chandler	 Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! (Pause) The Blowfish!
181	Monica	 It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
182	Phoebe	 So...Thank you.
183	Ross	 Could you be less enthused?
184	Joey	 Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like...
185	Monica	 Like?
186	Joey	 Charity.
187	Monica	 Charity?
188	Ross	 We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
189	Rachel	 Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. (Holds her thumb and forefinger a short distance apart.)
190	Phoebe	 Actually, it makes us feel that big. (She squeezes Rachel's thumb and forefinger closer together.)
191	Ross	 I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
192	Chandler	 If you guys feel this big (imitates Rachel's gesture), maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
193	Joey	 Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
194	Rachel	 Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
195	Phoebe	 I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
196	Rachel	 Me neither.
197	Joey	 Me too.
198	Monica	 Guys, we bought the tickets.
199	Phoebe	 Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
200	Chandler	 (to Phoebe) Why did you look at me when you said that?
201	Monica	 Well, I guess now we can't go.
202	Rachel	 What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
203	Monica	 You know what? You're right.
204	Phoebe	 Fine.
205	Ross	 Fine. (Exits)
206	Joey	 Fine.
207	Chandler	 Fine. (Exits)
208	Rachel	 Fine.
209	Monica	 All right. We're gonna go. (Exits, then comes back in) It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
210	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is standing at the fridge as Ross enters hiding Chandler behind the door.]
211	Ross	 Chandler!
212	Chandler	 (startling Ross) Yeah?
213	Ross	 Geez! Are you ready?
214	Chandler	 Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
215	Ross	 Whoa! You had sex today?
216	Chandler	 Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
217	Ross	 Wow!
218	Chandler	 Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
219		(The phone rings and Chandler doesn't answer it.)
220	Ross	 Still doing the screening thing?
221	Chandler	 I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
222	Machine	 Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
223	Jade	 Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
224	Chandler	 (answering the phone) Bob here.
225	Jade	 Oh, hi.
226	Chandler	 So, uh, you met someone, huh?
227	Jade	 Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. (Chandler and Ross dance in joy.)
228	Chandler	 So, uh, how was he?
229	Jade	 Eh.
230		(Pause)
231	Chandler	 Eh?
232	Jade	 Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
233	Chandler	 Well, that makes me feel so good.
234	Jade	 It was just so awkward and bumpy.
235	Ross	 (silently mouthing) Bumpy?
236	Chandler	 Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
237	Jade	 Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
238		(Chandler grimaces.)
239	[Scene	 The Concert, Ross, Monica, and Chandler are sitting in their seats looking at the three empty ones.]
240	Monica	 You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
241	Ross	 Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
242	Chandler	 So, let's go.
243		(They get up and start to leave, but the band starts to play.)
244	Ross	 Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
245	Chandler	 Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them (the band) for us to leave now.
246	Monica	 You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
247	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is trying to entertain Phoebe and Rachel.]
248	Joey	 (holding a hand behind his back) Come on you guys, one more time.
249	Phoebe	 Ok. One.
250	Joey	 Nooo. (He brings out his hand and is holding up two fingers.)
251	[Scene	 The Concert, the show has ended and everyone is starting to leave.]
252	Monica	 That was amazing!
253	Ross	 Excellent, that was excellent.
254	Chandler	 I can't believe the guys missed this.
255	Ross	 What guys? Oh, yeah.
256	Young Man	 Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
257	Monica	 Do I know you?
258	Young Man	 You used to be my babysitter.
259	Monica	 Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
260	Steve	 Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
261	Monica	 You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
262	Steve	 Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
263	Monica	 Uh, wait, backstage?
264	Steve	 Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
265	Ross	 (introducing himself) Ross.
266	Chandler	 (introducing himself) Chandler.
267	Steve	 How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
268	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are there as Ross, Monica, and Chandler enter.]
269	Ross	 Hey, you guys.
270	Rachel	 Happy birthday.
271	Ross	 Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
272	Rachel	 Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
273	Monica	 Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
274	Rachel	 Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
275	Monica	 Uh, good.
276	Ross	 Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
277	Chandler	 Yeah, we really missed you guys.
278	Joey	 Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.
279	Phoebe	 We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get—(notices something on Monica's neck)—Is that a hickey?
280	Monica	 No, I just, I fell down.
281	Rachel	 On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
282	Monica	 You know, a party, or...
283	Rachel	 What party?
284	Ross	 It wasn't so much a party as a...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
285	Joey	 You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
286	Chandler	 Yes, apparently Stevie and Hootie are like this. (Holds up crossed fingers.)
287	Rachel	 Who gave you that hickey?
288	Monica	 That would be the work of a Blowfish.
289	Rachel	 Oh!
290	Phoebe	 Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
291	Ross	 Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
292	Rachel	 What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
293		(Monica's pager goes off)
294	Monica	 Oh great, it's work. (To Ross) Can you hand me that? (Ross hands her the phone.)
295	Chandler	 I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
296	Joey	 And we don't work hard?
297	Monica	 (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
298	Chandler	 I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
299	Joey	 And you feel like we hold you back.
300	Chandler	 Yes.
301	Rachel	 Oh!
302	Chandler	 No.
303		(Everyone starts bickering.)
304	Monica	 Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. (They quiet down.) Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. (Listens) What corporate policy? (Listens) No. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) I just got fired.
305	Phoebe	 Oh.
306		(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)
307	Waitress	 (To Monica) Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
308	Joey	 (grabs the check) Let me get that. (To Chandler) You got five bucks?
309		Closing Credits
310	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is lying on the couch as the phone rings. He's also screening the calls.]
311	Machine	 Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
312	Jade	 Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
313		(Joey lunges for phone and misses.)
