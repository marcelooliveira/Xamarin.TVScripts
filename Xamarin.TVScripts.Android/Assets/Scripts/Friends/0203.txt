2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, everyone except Chandler is playing poker.]
3	Chandler	 (entering) Hey.
4	All	 Hey!
5	Monica	 So how was Joan?
6	Chandler	 I broke up with her.
7	Ross	 Don’t tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
8	Chandler	 They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
9	Rachel	 Come on, they were not that huge.
10	Chandler	 I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
11	Monica	 How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
12	Joey	 Hold it, hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
13	Chandler	 (To Ross) You or me?
14	Ross	 I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
15	Joey	 You guys are messing with me, right?
16	All	 Yeah.
17	Joey	 That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
18		Opening Credits
19	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is getting Ross and Chandler a beer.]
20	Phoebe	 You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
21	Chandler	 Maureen Rosilla.
22	Ross	 "’Cause she doesn’t hate Yanni," is not a real reason.
23		(There’s a knock on the door.)
24	Monica	 (opening the door) Hello, Mr. Heckles.
25	Mr. Heckles	 You're doing it again.
26	Monica	 We're not doing anything.
27	Mr. Heckles	 You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
28	Rachel	 You don't have birds.
29	Mr. Heckles	 I could have birds.
30	Monica	 Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
31	Mr. Heckles	 Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
32	Rachel	 All right, bye-bye.
33		(Monica closes the door.)
34	Chandler	 Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
35	Ross	 We'll give you Janice.
36	Phoebe	 I miss Janice though. (Imitating Janice) "Hello, Chandler Bing."
37	Rachel	 (doing Janice) "Oh, my, god."
38	Joey	 (doing Janice) "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!" (He turns around and everyone is staring at him.)
39		(Mr. Heckles bangs on his ceiling.)
40	Monica	 Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
41		(She stomps in protest. Heckles bangs again, which is answered by Monica and Rachel. Heckles bangs yet again, which is answered by everyone. There is no response.)
42	Rachel	 We won. We won!
43		[Cut to a man wrapped up on a sheet being wheeled out on a gurney with the gang and Mr. Treeger looking on.]
44	Monica	 Mr. Heckles.
45	Rachel	 How did this happen?
46	Mr. Treeger	 He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.
47	Monica	 That's terrible.
48	Mr. Treeger	 I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.
49	Ross	 Sure, you coulda. You never know.
50	Mr. Treeger	 You never know.
51	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, the next day everyone is eating dinner.]
52	Phoebe	 Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. (Screaming) Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
53	Chandler	 Ok, Phoebe.
54	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. (Everyone groans) That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
55	Joey	 Such as?
56	Phoebe	 Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
57	Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
58	Phoebe	 Nah. Not really.
59	Ross	 You don't believe in evolution?
60	Phoebe	 I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
61	Ross	 Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, is-is too easy?
62	Phoebe	 Yeah, I just don't buy it.
63	Ross	 Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
64	Phoebe	 Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
65	Ross	 You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
66	Phoebe	 Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
67		(There’s a knock on the door.)
68	Chandler	 Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
69		(Monica opens the door.)
70	Mr. Treeger	 There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
71	Monica	 What can we do for you?
72	Mr. Boyle	 All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "The noisy girls in the apartment above mine."
73	Monica	 Well, what about his family?
74	Mr. Boyle	 He didn't have any.
75	Rachel	 Ok, so let's talk money.
76	Mr. Boyle	 All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. (To Monica) You be noisy girl number one, (To Rachel) you be noisy girl number two.
77	Monica	 I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?
78	[Scene	 Mr. Heckles’ apartment, the gang is looking over Monica and Rachel’s inheritance.]
79	Monica	 Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
80	Rachel	 Have you ever seen so much crap?
81	Chandler	 Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
82	Joey	 Check this out. Can I have this? (It’s a giant magnifying glass on a stand.)
83		[Cut to Phoebe and Ross.]
84	Ross	 How can you not believe in evolution?
85	Phoebe	 Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
86	Ross	 Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
87	Phoebe	 Really? You can actually see it?
88	Ross	 You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
89	Phoebe	 See, I didn't know that.
90	Ross	 Well, there you go.
91	Phoebe	 Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
92	Chandler	 (holding a book) Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
93	Joey	 Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
94	Chandler	 April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
95	Rachel	 Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. (She’s holding a lamp made from seashells.) Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
96	Monica	 Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
97	Rachel	 What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool. (It’s a girl in a bikini and pasties standing behind an alarm clock.)
98	Monica	 It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
99	Rachel	 Well, what about my stuff?
100	Monica	 You don't have any stuff.
101	Rachel	 You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
102	Monica	 No.
103	Rachel	 Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
104	Monica	 Mmmmm.
105	Rachel	 Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
106	Ross	 Ok, Pheebs. (He’s holding two little toys.) See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
107	Phoebe	 Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
108	Ross	 Please tell me you're joking.
109	Phoebe	 Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
110	Ross	 No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because—
111	Phoebe	 What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
112	Ross	 (To Chandler) Is there blood coming out of my ears?
113	Joey	 Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
114	Chandler	 Wow, he looks so normal.
115	Phoebe	 He's even kind of cute.
116	Joey	 "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school."
117	Chandler	 Funniest? Heckles?
118	Joey	 That's what it says.
119	Chandler	 Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. (There’s a banging coming from upstairs.) He was right. Would you listen to that?
120	Phoebe	 I'd call that excessive.
121	Chandler	 Whoa!
122	Joey	 What?
123	Chandler	 Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler’s club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
124	Joey	 So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
125	Chandler	 I just think it's weird, you know? (The banging is back.) Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles… (He picks up the broom and bangs on the ceiling) Would you knock it off? (Everyone stares) (Realizes) Bah! (He throws the broom down.)
126		Commercial Break
127	[Scene	 Mr. Heckles’ Apartment, Chandler is in one of Heckles’ old robes and sitting on the couch.]
128	Joey	 (entering) Have you been here all night?
129	Chandler	 Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. (As he mentions each name and description, he hands a picture to Joey.) Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
130	Joey	 Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
131	Chandler	 Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
132	Joey	 All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
133	Chandler	 What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ‘supposably?’
134	Joey	 Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
135	Chandler	 How do you know that? How?
136	Joey	 I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
137	Chandler	 You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
138	Joey	 Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
139	Chandler	 Yeah, I understand.
140	Joey	 You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
141	Chandler	 You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
142	Joey	 Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
143	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey’s, Chandler enters, picks up the phone, and dials.]
144	Chandler	 (on phone) Hi, it's me.
145	Janice	 Oh, my, god.
146	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is telling everyone about his phone call.]
147	Phoebe	 Janice? You called Janice?
148	Chandler	 Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
149	Ross	 You remember Janice, right?
150	Chandler	 Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
151	Janice	 (entering and pregnant) Helloo!!
152	Chandler	 Oh…my…God!
153	Joey	 (To Chandler) Geez, look how fat she got.
154	Janice	 Hey, it's everybody.
155	Chandler	 Janice, you're…
156	Janice	 Yes, I am.
157	Chandler	 Is it…
158	Janice	 Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now. (She shows everyone her ring.)
159	Chandler	 Congratulations.
160	Janice	 Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
161	Chandler	 You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
162	Janice	 And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
163	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, Rachel is reading and admiring her new lamp.]
164	Monica	 Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
165	Rachel	 What?
166	Monica	 Hide the Lamp.
167	Rachel	 Monica, let it go.
168	Monica	 Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
169	Rachel	 Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
170		(Ross enters carrying a briefcase.)
171	Phoebe	 Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
172	Ross	 Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
173	Phoebe	 Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
174	Ross	 It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
175	Phoebe	 Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? (Holding her thumb and forefinger close together) Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this? (Monica and Rachel are intrigued.)
176	Ross	 There might be…a teeny…tiny…possibility.
177	Phoebe	 I can't believe you caved.
178	Ross	 What?
179	Phoebe	 You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? (Ross slowly closes the briefcase and walks out hugging it.) Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
180	Rachel	 I am. Let me just get my coat.
181		(As Monica puts on her coat she knocks over and breaks the seashell lamp.)
182	Rachel	 (running into the living room) What happened?! What happened?!
183	Monica	 Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
184	Rachel	 Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
185	Monica	 Phoebe, tell her!
186	Phoebe	 Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
187		(Chandler enters.)
188	Rachel	 Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
189	Chandler	 Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
190	Rachel	 Ok, you win.
191	Monica	 Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
192	Chandler	 Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
193	Phoebe	 Uh huh. Why is that?
194	Chandler	 If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y’know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
195	Monica	 You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
196	Chandler	 Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
197	Rachel	 Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
198	Monica	 You are not a freak. You're a guy.
199	Rachel	 She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
200	Monica	 Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
201	Chandler	 In a bad way?
202	Monica	 No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
203	Rachel	 Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
204	Phoebe	 Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
205	Monica	 You made it!
206	Phoebe	 You're there!
207	Rachel	 You are ready to make a commitment!
208	Chandler	 Whoa! Don't know about that.
209	[Scene	 Mr. Heckles’ Apartment, everyone is finishing cleaning up the apartment as Monica walks up to Rachel carrying the girlie clock.]
210	Rachel	 What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
211	Monica	 No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
212	Rachel	 Thank you.
213		(The clock sounds it’s alarm by whistling and having the girl shake her hips.)
214	Monica	 That's fine.
215	Chandler	 Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty. She's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
216	Joey	 Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
217	Chandler	 I'll take that.
218	Joey	 You want his yearbook?
219	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
220	Monica	 Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but he was a person. (She ends up standing behind the magnifying glass and everyone is laughing.) (Realizes.)You're all going to hell.
221	Rachel	 It's really not that big!
222		(Joey grabs the magnifying glass and walks out.)
223	Chandler	 (To Joey) Takin' that with you, huh?
224	Joey	 Oh, yeah.
225	Ross	 You comin'?
226	Chandler	 Yeah, just second. (Ross exits and Chandler picks up the broom and leans it up against the wall.) Good-bye Mr. Heckles. (He turns off the lights.) We'll try to keep it down.
227		Ending Credits
228	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Chandler is on his date with Allison.]
229	Allison	 Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted?"
230	Chandler	 Sure. (In his head.) My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her
