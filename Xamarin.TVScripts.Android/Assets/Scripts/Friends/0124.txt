2	[Scene	 Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is showing pictures of his new baby boy, Ben, to the group.]
3	Ross	 And here's little Ben nodding off...
4	Monica	 Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
5	Phoebe	 Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
6	Rachel	 Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
7		(Ross is practically drooling over Rachel at this point.)
8	Ross	 (quietly) That would be nice.
9		(Chandler, annoyed with Ross's fawning, makes a 'pfft' noise.)
10	Rachel	 Pardon?
11	Chandler	 Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
12		(Joey is looking at his check.)
13	Joey	 Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
14	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
15	Joey	 I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
16	Chandler	 (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
17	Joey	 Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
18	Ross	 (overhearing) What kind of research?
19	Joey	 Oh, just, y'know.... science.
20	Ross	 Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)
21	Joey	 (sigh)... It's a fertility study.
22		(Rachel laughs.)
23	Monica	 Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
24	Joey	 Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
25	Ross	 Hey.
26	Phoebe	 Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
27	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are preparing for a barbecue for Rachel's birthday.]
28	Monica	 OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
29	Phoebe	 We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to Monica)
30		(Chandler and Joey enter with charcoal.)
31	Chandler	 (in a deep voice) Men are here.
32	Joey	 We make fire. Cook meat.
33	Chandler	 Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
34	Monica and Phoebe	 Ewww!
35	Monica	 Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
36	Joey	 Oh, OK.
37	Phoebe	 So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
38	Joey	 I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
39	Monica	 Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
40	Joey	 What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
41	Monica	 Man's got a point.
42	Joey	 Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
43	Chandler	 Crazy bitch.
44	Joey	 Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
45	Monica	 Joey... we always know what you mean.
46		[Time lapse. Chandler and Joey are making the fire, Monica and Phoebe are inside. Ross enters, carrying luggage.]
47	Phoebe	 Hey.
48	Monica	 Hey.
49	Ross	 Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
50	Phoebe	 How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
51	Ross	 I'm going to China.
52	Phoebe	 Jeez, you say one thing, and...
53	Monica	 You're going to China?
54	Ross	 Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)
55	Phoebe	 Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
56	Ross	 (to Monica)
57	Monica	 Yeah.
58		(Phoebe puts the picture of Ross up to her face.)
59	Phoebe	 Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
60	Ross	 Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
61	Monica	 Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
62	Ross	 Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
63	Monica	 You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
64	Ross	 No.
65	Phoebe	 Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
66	Ross	 At the coffeehouse, right.
67	Phoebe	 So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.
68	Ross	 OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
69	Phoebe	 Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
70		(Ross goes outisde on the balcony.)
71	Ross	 Hi.
72	Joey	 Hey!
73	Chandler	 Hey!
74	Ross	 (sigh)....I have to go to China.
75	Joey	 The country?
76	Ross	 No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
77	Chandler	 Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
78	Ross	 Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
79	Joey	 Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
80	Chandler	 Forget about her.
81	Joey	 He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
82	Chandler	 Course there, they just call it food.
83	Ross	 Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)
84	Joey	 Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
85	Ross	 I know.
86	Joey	 We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)
87	Chandler	 I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
88		[Time lapse. Melanie, Joey's girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel. Ross is gone.]
89	Melanie	 Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
90	Joey	 Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
91	Chandler	 (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
92	Monica	 (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
93	Rachel	 Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)
94		(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)
95	Monica	 Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
96	Joey	 Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
97		(Monica rolls her eyes.)
98	Joey	 Then you do. Heh, heh.
99	Monica	 So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
100	Joey	 What do you mean?
101	Monica	 Y'know, just be there for her.
102		(Long pause... Joey looks confused.)
103	Joey	 Not following you.
104	Monica	 Think about it.
105		(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.)
106	Rachel	 OK, I'm guessing this is from...
107		(Melanie smiles.)
108	Rachel	 Well, thank you, Melanie.
109	Chandler	 (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
110	Rachel	 (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
111		(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)
112	Rachel	 This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!
113	Phoebe	 Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
114	Joey	 (to Rachel)
115	Melanie	 There is a little child inside this man!
116	Chandler	 Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
117		(Rachel picks up the next gift.)
118	Rachel	 Who's this from?
119	Chandler	 Oh, that's Ross's.
120	Rachel	 Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
121	Phoebe	 Remembered what?
122	Rachel	 It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
123	Chandler	 Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
124	Phoebe	 Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
125	Monica	 I can't believe he did this.
126	Chandler	 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
127		(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)
128	Rachel	 What did you just say?
129	Chandler	 (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
130	Rachel	 No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
131	Chandler	 (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
132	Rachel	 Oh.... my God.
133	Chandler	 (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
134	Joey	 (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
135		Commercial Break
136	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
137	Rachel	 I mean, this is unbelievable.
138	Phoebe	 I know. This is really, really huge.
139	Chandler	 No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
140	Phoebe	 Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
141	Chandler	 OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
142	Monica	 I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
143	Rachel	 No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey)
144	Joey	 Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
145	Rachel	 Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)
146	Chandler	 (quickly) H-He's in China!
147	Joey	 The country.
148	Monica	 No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
149	Chandler	 What about the time difference?
150	Monica	 From here to the airport?
151	Chandler	 Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
152	Monica	 Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
153	Rachel	 I-I-I don't know.
154	Chandler	 Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
155	Joey	 He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
156	Monica	 Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
157	Rachel	 I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
158	Phoebe	 Here, look, alright, does this help?
159		(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)
160	Rachel	 Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)
161	Chandler	 Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
162	[Scene	 Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a 'How To Speak Chinese' tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there.]
163	Ross	 (something in Chinese)
164	Flight Attendant	 Alright!
165	Ross	 Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
166		(Rachel runs into the airport, trying to catch Ross, moving people out of the way.)
167	Rachel	 Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
168		(Rachel gets up to the jetway.)
169	Flight Attendant	 Hi!
170	Rachel	 Hi.
171	Flight Attendant	 May I see your boarding pass?
172	Rachel	 Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
173	Flight Attendant	 Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
174	Rachel	 No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
175	Flight Attendant	 No no no! Federal regulations!
176	Rachel	 OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
177	Flight Attendant	 Alright. What's the message?
178	Rachel	 Uh... I don't know.
179		[Cut to the Jetway, the flight attendant enters, walks past Ross, and approaches an older man with his wife who is also wearing a blue jacket.]
180	Flight Attendant	 Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
181	Man	 (confused) What?
182	Flight Attendant	 It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
183	Man	 (to wife)
184	[Scene	 Joey's Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together.]
185	Melanie	 Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
186	Joey	 Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
187	Melanie	 Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing his chest)
188	Joey	 (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
189	Melanie	 (surprised) M-Me again?
190	Joey	 Sure! Why not?
191	Melanie	 Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
192		(Joey starts to kiss her.)
193	Melanie	 Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
194	Joey	 How do you mean?
195	Melanie	 I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
196	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding the wrapping paper from one of Rachel's gifts.]
197	Monica	 Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
198	Rachel	 I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
199	Monica and Phoebe	 Sure.
200	Rachel	 I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
201	Monica	 Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
202	Phoebe	 Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
203	Monica	 Another good point.
204	Phoebe	 No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
205	Rachel	 (confused) Huh?
206	Phoebe	 Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
207	Monica	 Why isn't it working out?
208	Rachel	 I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
209	Monica	 Is he not cute enough for you?
210	Rachel	 No!
211	Monica	 Does he not make enough money?
212	Rachel	 No, I'm just....
213	Phoebe	 Maybe there's someone else.
214	Rachel	 Wha...
215	Monica	 Is there? Is there someone else?
216	Rachel	 No! There is.. there is noone else!
217	Monica	 Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
218	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his bedroom door.]
219	Chandler	 Hey, big...
220	Joey	 Shhhh!
221	Chandler	 (quietly) ...spender.
222	Joey	 She's still asleep.
223	Chandler	 So how'd it go?
224	Joey	 Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
225	Chandler	 The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
226	Joey	 Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
227	Chandler	 Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
228	Joey	 It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
229	Chandler	 I didn't know you had another level.
230	Joey	 I know! Neither did I!
231	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her bedroom.]
232	Monica	 Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
233	Rachel	 Yeah.
234	Monica	 Oh, from who?
235	Rachel	 From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
236	Monica	 Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
237	Rachel	 Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
238	Monica	 Oh, why?
239	Rachel	 Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
240	Monica	 (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
241	Rachel	 Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
242	Monica	 I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
243		(Door buzzer goes off. Rachel answers it.)
244	Rachel	 Who is it?
245	Intercom	 It's me, Carl.
246	Rachel	 C'mon up.
247	Monica	 Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
248	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.]
249	Joey	 Seven hundred bucks!
250	Chandler	 Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
251	Joey	 Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
252	Chandler	 Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
253	Joey	 What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
254	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.]
255	Carl	 I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
256		(Rachel looks bored. At this point, Ross—a figment of Rachel's imagination— shows up on the balcony and starts talking to her.)
257	Ross	 I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
258	Rachel	 Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
259	Ross	 Fine, just stop thinking about me.
260		(She tries, and Ross disappears momentarily. He reappears, standing closer to her.)
261	Ross	 Can't do it, can you?
262	Rachel	 So I'm thinking about you. So what?
263	Ross	 I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
264	Rachel	 Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
265	Carl	 I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
266	Ross	 Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
267	Rachel	 Ross, it's too hard.
268	Ross	 No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
269	Rachel	 Ross, you're like my best friend.
270	Ross	 I know.
271	Rachel	 If we broke up, and I lost you...
272	Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
273	Rachel	 Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
274	Ross	 (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
275	Rachel	 I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
276	Ross	 Well, start looking.
277		(They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)
278	Rachel	 Wow.
279	Carl	 Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
280	Rachel	 Right! You're right!
281	Carl	 Heh... y'know?
282	Rachel	 You know what?
283	Carl	 What?
284	Rachel	 I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
285		(Rachel leaves.)
286	Carl	 But...
287	[Scene	 Airport. Madonna's Take A Bow plays in the background as Rachel waits at the gate with flowers.]
288	Rachel	 (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
289		[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel's message to gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]
290	Man	 For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
291		(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)
292	Ross	 Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
293		(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)
294	Julie	 Oh, thanks, sweetie.
295	Ross	 No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
296	Julie	 Really?
297	Ross	 Yeah.
298	Julie	 You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
299	Ross	 No, no, they will. I just... uh...
300	Ross and Julie	 Can't wait.
301	Ross	 Come on, they're gonna love you.
302		[Cut to a close-up of Rachel, eagerly awaiting Ross's arrival... not knowing he is getting off the plane with another woman.]
303		End
