7	Rachel	 You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
8	Joey	 Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
9	Rachel	 I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
10	Joey	 No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
11	Monica	 Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
12	Rachel	 Of course, I'd be honored!
13	Chandler	 Thanks!
14	Monica	 Thank you!
15		(Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision)
16	Joey	 U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
17	Chandler	 Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
18	Monica	 Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
19	Joey	 Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
20	Monica	 Clearly we were wrong.
21	Joey	 I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
22	Monica	 You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
23	Joey	 Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
24	Chandler	 So excited about your letter!
25		(Phoebe enters)
26	Phoebe	 Hey!
27	All	 Hey Phoebe!
28	Joey	 Hey!
29	Monica	 Wow! Don't you look nice?!
30	Phoebe	 Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
31	Rachel	 OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
32	Phoebe	 YEAH!
33	Chandler	 So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
34	Phoebe	 Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
35	Joey	 Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
36	Phoebe	 Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
37	Monica	 You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
38	Chandler	 That's where people make number two!!
39		OPENING CREDITS
40	[Scene	 Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches him.]
41		
42	Charlie	 Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)
43	Ross	 Hey...
44	Charlie	 So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
45	Ross	 (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
46	Charlie	 Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...
47	Ross	 (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!
48	Charlie	 Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
49	Ross	 Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
50		(they start kissing but someone knocks at the door)
51	Ross	 Damnit!
52	Amy	 (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks on the door again) I have to talk to you!!
53	Ross	 (he opens the door) Hi Amy!
54	Amy	 You're not Rachel.
55	Ross	 Still sharp as a tack!
56	Amy	 Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
57	Charlie	 Hi!
58	Amy	 Hi!
59	Charlie	 Nice to meet you.
60	Amy	 H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?
61	Ross	 (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
62	Amy	 (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
63	Ross	 (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.
64		
65	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment]
66		
67		(Ross enters the apartment with Amy)
68	Ross	 Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
69	Rachel	 Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
70	Amy	 Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
71	Joey	 That's right, yeah.
72	Amy	 You're not good!
73	Joey	 Always nice to meet a fan!
74	Rachel	 So now, what are you doing here?
75	Amy	 Well, I have huge news.
76	Rachel	 (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
77	Amy	 Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)
78	Ross	 Ehm... Her name is Emma.
79	Amy	 Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
80	Ross	 What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
81	Amy	 Hey, your English is getting better!!
82	Ross	 (to Joey) Oh my God!
83	Joey	 I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
84	Ross	 What... what you working on?
85	Joey	 (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
86	Ross	 Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
87	Joey	 What did I just say?
88	Ross	 Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
89	Joey	 Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
90		
91	[Scene	 Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing behind her.]
92		
93	Rachel	 God!
94	Amy	 So beautiful.
95	Rachel	 Oh, I know, isn't she?
96	Amy	 No, I was talking about your bedding.
97	Rachel	 All right. What's your news, Amy?
98	Amy	 Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
99	Rachel	 What? Oh my God! To who?
100	Amy	 This guy! He has a killer apartment.
101	Rachel	 A-And??
102	Amy	 A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
103	Rachel	 No, what's he like?
104	Amy	 Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
105	Rachel	 Yeah.
106	Amy	 It's his dad.
107	Rachel	 Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
108	Amy	 Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
109	Rachel	 Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
110	Amy	 Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
111	Rachel	 Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
112	Amy	 Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
113	Rachel	 Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
114	Amy	 (thinks about it) You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna do it!
115	Rachel	 Ok.
116	Amy	 I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
117	Rachel	 Ok, let’s keep talking.
118		
119	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to their seats.]
120		
121	Phoebe	 Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe it's been a whole year!
122	Mike	 I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
123	Phoebe	 ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
124	Mike	 I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
125	Phoebe	 YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
126	Announcer	 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)
127	Phoebe	 Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
128	Mike	 Really?
129	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
130	Mike	 (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did).
131		
132	[Scene	 Monica’s apartment. Joey enters the room]
133		
134	Joey	 Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
135	Chandler	 (reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
136	Joey	 (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
137	Monica	 (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.
138	Joey	 Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
139	Chandler	 On every word?
140	Joey	 Yep!
141	Monica	 Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)
142	Joey	 Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
143	Chandler	 And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
144	Joey	 Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
145	Monica	 Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
146	Joey	 Why not?
147	Monica	 Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
148	Chandler	 You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
149		
150	[Scene	 The corridor. Amy knocks Joey’s door and Rachel opens the door.]
151		
152	Rachel	 Amy, hi!
153	Amy	 I took your advice, I left Myron.
154	Rachel	 Oh, good for you!
155	Amy	 I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
156	Rachel	 Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
157	Amy	 Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
158	Rachel	 But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
159		(Joey comes out of Monica’s apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does not notice the huge amount of bags)
160	Joey	 Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
161	Amy	 Well, I’m staying with you guys!
162	Joey	 What?
163	Amy	 We’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!
164		
165	[Scene	 Joey’s apartment. Rachel is in the living room and Joey comes out of his room.]
166		
167	Joey	 You slept out here?
168	Rachel	 Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’
169	Joey	 But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.
170	Rachel	 Joey, I can’t do that!
171	Joey	 Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
172	Rachel	 Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
173	Joey	 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
174	Rachel	 No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
175	Joey	 Yeah, Monica made us!
176	Rachel	 Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.
177	Amy	 Good morning.
178	Joey	 Yeaah.
179	Rachel	 Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.
180	Amy	 Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off.
181	Rachel	 Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
182	Amy	 Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
183	Joey	 (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
184		
185	[Scene	 Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there, Phoebe enters the room]
186		
187	Phoebe	 Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
188	Chandler	 I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
189	Monica	 Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
190	Ross	 Seriously?
191	Chandler	 Word!
192	Phoebe	 Well, mine was worse than that.
193	Rachel	 Well, what happened?
194	Phoebe	 We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
195	Rachel	 Oh, that is so tacky.
196	Phoebe	 Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
197	Monica	 Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
198	Rachel	 Phoebe, that’s huge!
199	Ross	 Well, do you wanna marry him?
200	Phoebe	 Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
201	Chandler	 She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?
202	Monica	 Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
203	Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
204	Monica	 I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...
205	Chandler	 Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
206	Monica	 Thank you.
207	Phoebe	 (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?
208	Rachel	 I think it could be kind of great!
209	Ross	 Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
210	Phoebe	 Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
211	Monica	 How about at a game, on the big screen?
212	Rachel	 (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)
213	Monica	 What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
214	Phoebe	 Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?
215	Chandler	 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
216		(Amy walks in carrying a phone handset)
217	Amy	 (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)
218	Rachel	 (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
219	Amy	 She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
220	Rachel	 (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
221	Ross	 No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
222	Rachel	 Menstrual cramps.
223	Ross	 I don't think that's what this is.
224	Rachel	 (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
225	Monica	 No, sorry sweety..
226	Phoebe	 No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
227	Rachel	 (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
228	Amy	 Well, I can do it.
229	Rachel	 (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...
230	Ross	 (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
231	Rachel	 Yeah.
232	Ross	 Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
233	Rachel	 Why not?
234	Ross	 Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella! Rachel
235	Ross	 Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
236	Rachel	 (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
237	Ross	 (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
238	Rachel	 Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
239	Ross	 I... I don't know..
240	Rachel	 Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
241		(Amy approaches from behind)
242	Amy	 um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)
243		(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)
244	Rachel	 Absolutely.
245	Amy	 (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)
246		
247	[Scene	 Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk in.]
248		
249	Chandler	 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
250	Joey	 Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
251		(Chandler and Monica look shocked)
252	Monica	 You dropped it off?
253	Joey	 Yeah.
254	Chandler	 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
255	Joey	 No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
256	Monica	 You hand-wrote it?
257	Joey	 Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)
258	Monica	 Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
259	Chandler	 It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
260	Monica	 Okay good.
261	Chandler	 (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
262	Monica	 Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
263	Chandler	 (Still looks confused) They loved it.
264	Monica	 What?
265	Chandler	 They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
266	Monica	 (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?
267	Chandler	 She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
268		(Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller)
269	Amy	 Hi!
270	Monica	 Hey, what did you guys do today?
271	Amy	 Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
272	Chandler	 That sounds like fun.
273	Amy	 Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
274		(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)
275	Rachel	 (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
276	Amy	 I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
277	Rachel	 (sounds excited) Yeah!
278		(Amy takes off Emma's hat)
279	Amy	 Ta-daaa!
280		(Rachel looks at Emma)
281	Rachel	 (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
282	Amy	 (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
283		(Rachel looks very shocked)
284		COMMERCIAL BREAK
285	Rachel	 You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
286	Amy	 Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
287	Chandler	 I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!
288	Rachel	 Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
289	Amy	 Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
290	Rachel	 Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)
291		(Ross enters)
292	Ross	 Hey guys. Monica and Chandler
293	Ross	 Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).
294	Rachel	 Nah, I don't really want her to see.
295	Ross	 Why not?
296	Monica	 Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
297	Chandler	 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
298	Ross	 Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
299		(Rachel looks worried)
300	Ross	 (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
301	Rachel	 Nothing.
302	Ross	 (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.
303	Rachel	 Oh, they're real!
304	Ross	 Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
305	Rachel	 I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
306	Amy	 Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
307	Monica	 I'm a cool, fun aunt!
308	Amy	 (Sarcastically) O-Okay!
309	Chandler	 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
310	Rachel	 I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
311	Amy	 Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
312	Rachel	 Oh yeah? Since when?
313	Amy	 Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
314	Rachel	 (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
315	Ross	 That's not a thing!
316	Amy	 Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
317	Rachel	 (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.
318	Amy	 Enter Amy!
319	Ross	 (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
320	Amy	 What? What are you gonna do?
321	Ross	 (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!
322		(Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)
323		
324	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]
325		
326	Mike	 Great game, huh?
327	Phoebe	 Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
328	Mike	 Why do you keep looking at the screen?
329	Phoebe	 I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
330	Mike	 Going go to the bathroom.
331	Phoebe	 Well, I think you should wait.
332	Mike	 Why?
333	Phoebe	 Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
334	Announcer	 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
335	(We see the screen where it says	 "Mike will you marry me?" and then we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of Mike.)
336	Phoebe	 Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
337	Announcer	 Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)
338	Phoebe	 That's not very enlightened!
339		(There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him)
340	Phoebe	 Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
341		
342	[Scene	 Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone rings.]
343		
344	Joey	 (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!
345		(Rachel and Amy enter)
346	Rachel	 Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
347	Joey	 Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)
348	Amy	 You're kicking me out?
349	Rachel	 You put holes in my baby's ears!
350	Amy	 Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
351	Rachel	 (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
352	Amy	 You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
353	Rachel	 Excuse me?
354	Amy	 You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?
355	Rachel	 (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?
356	Joey	 (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!
357	Amy	 You know what? When I moved in here I thought
358	Rachel	 (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?
359	Amy	 hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
360	Rachel	 Hips or thighs?
361	Amy	 Ass and face.
362	Rachel	 (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
363	Amy	 She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
364	Rachel	 (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.
365	Amy	 You can?
366	Rachel	 Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
367	Amy	 (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
368	Rachel	 Did you just say Emma?
369	Amy	 Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
370	[Scene	 Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]
371		
372	Phoebe	 That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
373	Mike	 But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
374	Phoebe	 (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
375		(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)
376	Phoebe	 It's in the cake, isn't it?
377	Mike	 (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)
378	Phoebe	 What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
379	Mike	 No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
380		(Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face)
381	Mike	 I'm gonna do this now.
382	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
383		(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)
384	Mike	 Phoebe, I...
385	Phoebe	 Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
386	Mike	 Ready?
387	Phoebe	 Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
388	Mike	 Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
389	Phoebe	 Yes!
390		(Mike puts the ring on her finger)
391	Mike	 I love you!
392	Phoebe	 I love you more!
393	Mike	 Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
394		(They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.)
395		COMMERCIAL BREAK
396		
397	[Scene	 The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are walking on the sidewalk.]
398		
399	Rachel	 So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
400	Amy	 Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
401	Rachel	 That's shocking!
402	Amy	 Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel) He's rude!
403		THE END
