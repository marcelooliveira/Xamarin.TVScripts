3	Monica	 So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
4	Joey	 Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)
5	Chandler	 So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
6	Phoebe	 Since when are you into swing music?
7	Chandler	 Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
8	Monica	 Chandler.
9	Chandler	 Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
10	Monica	 I will.
11	Chandler	 Do you want me to call?
12	Monica	 No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.
13	Phoebe	 What is your job?
14	Chandler	 Staying out of the way.
15	Joey	 This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? (Hands back the paper.)
16	Monica	 There were only twelve.
17	Joey	 Oh yeah, I added three.
18	Monica	 What are peanut butter fingers?!
19	Joey	 Oh yeah… (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 A Street, Chandler and Ross are at a newsstand.]
22	Ross	 (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
23	Chandler	 Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
24	The Woman	 Could you guys help me? (Chandler shyly exhales and looks away.)
25	Ross	 Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
26	The Woman	 It-it’s really heavy.
27	Ross	 (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)
28	The Woman	 I-I am Kristen.
29	Ross	 Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.
30	Kristen	 I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
31	Ross	 Ah.
32	Kristen	 But-but this block is like a whole other world.
33	Ross	 Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)
34	Chandler	 (To Ross) Smooth.
35	Kristen	 (To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)
36	Ross	 Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
37	Kristen	 Oh I’d like that.
38	Ross	 Yeah?
39	Kristen	 Yeah.
40	Ross	 Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)
41	Kristen	 After you.
42	Ross	 Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)
43	[Scene	 A Bridal Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for Monica who is trying on her wedding dress.]
44	Phoebe	 (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
45		(Monica enters from the dressing room wearing her gown.)
46	Rachel	 Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
47	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
48	Monica	 This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!
49		(Another woman walks up.)
50	The Woman	 Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I’d cry.
51	Monica	 Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
52	The Woman	 I’m Megan Bailey.
53	Monica	 Have you found your dress yet?
54	Megan	 Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
55	Monica	 No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just here to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
56	Megan	 Oh, thanks for the tip.
57	Monica	 Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
58	Megan	 Oh I’m not, I just like to try these on.
59	Rachel	 I do the same thing.
60	Megan	 I’m just kidding. I’m getting married July 25th.
61	Rachel	 I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
62	Megan	 (To Monica) So when are you getting married?
63	Monica	 Oh May 15th.
64	Megan	 Oooh it’s getting close!
65	Monica	 Yeah!
66	Megan	 So uh, who’s your photographer?
67	Monica	 Jeffery.
68	Megan	 We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
69	Monica	 The best man? Wow!
70	Megan	 I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who’s your band?!
71	Monica	 Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
72	Megan	 Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
73	Phoebe	 Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!
74		(Another woman walks past Rachel carrying a wedding dress.)
75	Rachel	 Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
76	The Woman	 I own this store.
77	Rachel	 So, does this (the dress) come in another color or… (The store owner walks away.)
78	[Scene	 A Street, Joey is walking by Kristen, who is still moving in.]
79	Joey	 (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?
80	Kristen	 I’m moving in.
81	Joey	 Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
82	Kristen	 Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
83	Joey	 Boyfriend?
84	Kristen	 No.
85	Joey	 I’m Joey. (They shake hands.)
86	Kristen	 Kristen.
87	Joey	 Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?
88	Kristen	 Kristen.
89	Joey	 Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So…
90	Kristen	 So uh, do you live around here?
91	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
92	Kristen	 I’ll remember that.
93	Joey	 Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
94	Kristen	 Oh I, I have plans tonight.
95	Joey	 Oh.
96	Kristen	 But how about tomorrow?
97	Joey	 Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? (The lamp he’s holding.)
98	Kristen	 You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
99	Joey	 Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I’ll grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)
100	[Scene	 Kleinman’s, a horde of women including Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica are waiting for the store to open.]
101	A Woman	 What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
102	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
103	Monica	 All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! (Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts. When you hear it, come running.
104	Rachel	 Okay.
105	Phoebe	 Got it.
106	Monica	 All right.
107		(A worker comes to open the door and the horde starts to press forward.)
108	A Woman	 Here he comes! Hurry!
109	Rachel	 Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
110	Monica	 (To Rachel) Hey! Don’t be a baby!
111	Rachel	 Well I…
112		(The door opens allowing the horde to charge in, knocking Rachel out of the way and to the ground.)
113	A Woman	 Let’s go!!
114	Phoebe	 (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
115		[Time lapse, inside the store, Monica is frantically looking for her dress.]
116	Monica	 No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don’t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I’m sorry, this one’s taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!
117	Monica	 Megan!
118	Megan	 Monica!
119	Monica	 You came?!
120	Megan	 Yeah!
121	Monica	 This is my dress!
122	Megan	 No!
123	Monica	 Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
124	Megan	 And now you’ll see me buying it.
125	Monica	 What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me!
126	Megan	 Look, you don’t want to fight me.
127	Monica	 Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
128		[Cut to Phoebe in another part of the store.]
129	Phoebe	 (hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
130	Woman	 Hey!
131		(She hears another signal in another direction.)
132	Phoebe	 Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
133	Phoebe	 Did you find the dress?
134	Rachel	 No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
135	Phoebe	 I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
136	Rachel	 No! You gotta hold my hand!!
137	Phoebe	 Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
138		(She gets to Monica who has the dress balled up in one hand and is sitting on Megan who is sprawled out on the floor.)
139	Monica	 (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
140	Rachel	 (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…
141	Monica	 NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
142	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there.]
143	Chandler	 So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
144	Ross	 Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.
145	Chandler	 Huh.
146	Ross	 Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
147	Joey	 (entering) Hey Chandler!
148	Chandler	 Hey!
149	Joey	 Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.
150	Chandler	 Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!
151	Joey	 Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
152	Chandler	 Really? Right across the street?
153	Joey	 Yeah!
154	Chandler	 When’d you meet her?
155	Joey	 Two days ago.
156	Chandler	 Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
157	Joey	 Oh yeah?
158	Ross	 (returning) Hey.
159	Chandler	 Hi! How’d it go?
160	Ross	 Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
161	Chandler	 (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?
162	Joey	 Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not too worried about it.
163	Ross	 Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
164	Chandler	 So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name of the girl you’re dating?
165	Joey and Ross	 Kristen Lang.
166	Chandler	 Bye! (Exits.)
167		Commercial Break
168	[Scene	 Central Perk, time lapse from the earlier scene.]
169	Ross	 Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
170	Joey	 Obviously! So, how do we decide?
171	Ross	 Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…
172	Joey	 (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her.
173	Ross	 That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…
174	Joey	 Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…
175	Ross	 Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
176	Joey	 Yeah well we should order some food then.
177	Ross	 No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.
178	Joey	 (smiling) That sounds fair.
179	Ross	 Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…
180	Joey	 Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
181	Ross	 Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.
182	Joey	 All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
183	Ross	 So let’s decide on the spending limit…
184	Joey	 Yeah. Uh, (thinks)…a slice…(Thinks)…six dollars?
185	Ross	 I was thinking more like a hundred.
186	Joey	 Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
187	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are admiring Monica’s wedding dress.]
188	Monica	 Oh…
189	Phoebe	 I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
190		(Rachel goes to the fridge, opens it, and blows on the whistle Monica gave her at the store, which causes Phoebe and Monica to turn around and look at her.)
191	Rachel	 You’re out of Diet Coke.
192		(The phone rings and Monica answers it as Rachel goes into the bathroom.)
193	Monica	 Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh—(She is hung up on.)
194	Phoebe	 What?!
195	Monica	 That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!
196	Phoebe	 (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
197	Monica	 What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
198	Phoebe	 Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
199	Monica	 How?
200		(There are three short whistle blasts from the bathroom.)
201	Rachel	 You’re out of toilet paper!
202	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross is getting ready for his date with Kristen.]
203	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
204	Ross	 Hey! What’s up?
205	Joey	 I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.
206	Ross	 Oh thanks!
207	Joey	 Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
208	Ross	 We have 8
209	Joey	 Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.
210	Ross	 I am dressed.
211	Joey	 Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
212	Ross	 I have an oily T-zone!
213	Joey	 Okay dude! (Finds a receipt.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
214	Ross	 That’s right.
215	Joey	 You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!
216	Ross	 Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
217	Joey	 Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!
218	Ross	 Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
219	Joey	 I don’t know.
220	Ross	 Why am I not surprised?
221	Joey	 Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!
222	Ross	 I don’t think you have much choice.
223	Joey	 Well we’ll see!
224	Ross	 Bye-bye!
225	Joey	 Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So just a light layer?
226	Ross	 Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
227	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is entering without touching anything with his hands. Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are there.]
228	Chandler	 Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
229	Phoebe	 Yeah, swing music is so out.
230	Monica	 Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.
231	Chandler	 (returning) What are you guys talking about?
232	Monica	 Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.
233	Rachel	 Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.
234	Chandler	 But I love swing music!
235	Phoebe	 Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
236	Chandler	 Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.
237	Rachel	 Well, what is the other reason?
238	Chandler	 I don’t want to say.
239	Rachel	 Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
240	Chandler	 Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
241	Monica	 Oh crap!
242	[Scene	 Gramercy Bistro, Ross and Kristen are waiting for their table to be ready. Ross is returning from talking to the Maitre d'.]
243	Ross	 So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
244	Kristen	 Oh great!
245	Ross	 Yeah.
246	Kristen	 Is your back feeling better?
247	Ross	 Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasm out of control.
248	Joey	 (entering) Kristen?
249	Kristen	 Joey!
250	Joey	 Hi!
251	Kristen	 Hi! What are you doing here?
252	Joey	 Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…
253	Kristen	 Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
254	Joey	 Hi!
255	Ross	 Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
256	Kristen	 Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
257	Ross	 Yeah. So…
258	Joey	 Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
259	Ross	 So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
260	Kristen	 Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
261	Ross	 That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?
262	Joey	 A woman in a man’s body.
263	Ross	 Much better.
264	Joey	 So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
265	Ross	 Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.
266	Kristen	 Yeah, little Eric.
267	Ross	 That’s right! Wait no, Ben.
268	Joey	 So you’ve just married the one time then?
269	Ross	 Well umm…
270	Kristen	 You’ve been married twice?
271	Ross	 Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food?
272	Kristen	 You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
273	Joey	 (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
274	Kristen	 Do you two know each other?
275	Joey and Ross	 No. No.
276	Joey	 No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
277		(Kristen is not enjoying this.)
278	Ross	 Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
279	Joey	 Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
280	Ross	 Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
281	Joey	 Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
282	Ross	 Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
283	Joey	 Monkey lover!
284		(They both notice that Kristen has left.)
285	Joey	 When do you think we lost her?
286	Ross	 Probably around gonorrhea.
287	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is entering.]
288	Chandler	 Hi, honey! I’m home!
289	Monica	 (from the bedroom) Don’t come in here!
290	Chandler	 Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?
291	Monica	 No! We only mess around at his place!
292	Chandler	 Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scaring me. So could you come out here please?
293	Monica	 No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.
294	Chandler	 Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
295	Monica	 Yeah but I’m not keeping it.
296	Chandler	 Well then why can’t I see it?
297	Monica	 Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it.
298	Chandler	 Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you look…hideous.
299	Monica	 Really?
300	Chandler	 Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you have to return it?
301	Monica	 Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
302	Chandler	 Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
303	Monica	 Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.
304	Chandler	 Okay!
305		Ending Credits
306	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are watching a basketball game on the couch.]
307	Monica	 (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?
308	Chandler	 (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
309	Monica	 Alright, what’s going on?
310		(They all slowly turn around to reveal that they are giving themselves a facial.)
311	Monica	 I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)
312	Ross	 Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!
313	Joey	 Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y’know, she could use a little…(Whistles that she needs to do what they’re doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)
