2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready for a date with Monica as Ross enters.]
3	Ross	 Hey!
4	Chandler	 Hey!
5	Ross	 Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
6	Chandler	 Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
7	Ross	 Wow! How'd you get in there?
8	Chandler	 Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11
9		(There's a knock on the door and Chandler answers it. It's the pizza delivery girl.)
10	Delivery Girl	 Hi Chandler!
11	Chandler	 Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
12	Caitlin	 Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
13	Chandler	 Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
14	Caitlin	 It's uh, 27 dollars even.
15	Chandler	 Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
16		(The duck starts quacking.)
17	Caitlin	 Hey, where's the chicken?
18	Chandler	 Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
19	Caitlin	 (laughs) Great. I'll see you later!
20	Chandler	 Okay, bye!
21		(He closes the door and turns to see Ross glaring at him.)
22	Ross	 What the hell was that?!
23	Chandler	 What?
24	Ross	 The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
25	Chandler	 I was not flirting.
26	Ross	 It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)"
27	Chandler	 Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
28	Ross	 Yeah, right.
29	Chandler	 You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)
30	Ross	 (backing away) I'm good.
31		Opening Credits
32	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are in the kitchen.]
33	Rachel	 I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
34	Phoebe	 I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
35	Rachel	 No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
36	Phoebe	 Don't get me started on that.
37		(Ross and Chandler enter with the pizzas.)
38	Chandler	 I was not flirting.
39	Ross	 And on your anniversary, for shame!
40	Rachel	 What's going on?
41	Ross	 Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
42	Chandler	 I was not and oh God, shh!
43	Ross	 Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
44	Phoebe	 Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
45	Ross	 Well…
46	Chandler	 Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
47		(Ross looks at Rachel.)
48	Rachel	 Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
49	Ross	 Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
50	Rachel	 Hm-mmm.
51	Ross	 And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
52	Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
53	Phoebe	 (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
54	Ross	 This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
55	Phoebe	 See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
56	Joey	 (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
57	Rachel	 Big night!
58	Phoebe	 This is so cool!
59	Chandler	 So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
60	Joey	 Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
61	Chandler	 I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.
62	Joey	 She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
63		(They both start speaking Italian to each other, and since I'm not Italian and don't understand one word, we'll move on to the English portion of the show. Not, that I'm English. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I'm not. Y'know I think I should shut-up now and move on. Anyhoo, she says something about Joey being fat I think based on this line.)
64	Joey	 Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…
65	Monica	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
66	Chandler	 Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
67	Monica	 So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London…
68	Chandler	 Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
69	Monica	 Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
70	Chandler	 The one that doesn't.
71	Monica	 That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
72	Chandler	 Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
73	Monica	 That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
74	Chandler	 Okay.
75	Monica	 (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
76	Phoebe	 But I like it here!
77	Monica	 You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
78	Phoebe	 Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
79	Monica	 Great!
80	Phoebe	 Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
81	Rachel	 Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her room.)
82		(Phoebe then gets possessed 'cause she starts speaking in tongues. She speaks Italian to Joey's grandmother. She is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in English. Of course, too most people English is a strange language as well. But none of them are probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. So why am I talking about them? I have absolutely no clue. Moving on…)
83	Joey	 Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
84	Phoebe	 I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)
85	Rachel	 (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
86	Phoebe	 Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
87	Rachel	 Oh what, you-you want both of them?
88	Phoebe	 Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
89	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
90	Phoebe	 Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
91	Rachel	 Tell her to wear her own earrings.
92	Phoebe	 These are her earrings.
93	Rachel	 Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
94	Phoebe	 Why not?
95	Rachel	 Because I lose her stuff!
96		[Time Lapse, the gang is now watching Law & Order. By the way, the entire rest of the episode takes place in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? Something to think about.]
97	Joey	 Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
98		(His grandmother asks him something.)
99	Joey	 Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
100	Chandler	 If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
101	Monica	 (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
102	Rachel	 Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
103	Monica	 It's a diaper commercial.
104	Rachel	 Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
105		(There's a knock on the door.)
106	Caitlin	 Pizza delivery!
107	Ross	 I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
108	Caitlin	 Hi!
109	Ross	 Hi!
110	Caitlin	 One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
111	Ross	 Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
112	Caitlin	 What?!
113	Ross	 (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
114	Caitlin	 Oh. Thanks.
115	Ross	 You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
116	Caitlin	 Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
117	Chandler	 Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
118	Caitlin	 I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)
119	Chandler	 You're welcome.
120	Ross	 You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
121	Chandler	 What?
122	Ross	 This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
123	Monica	 What's goin' on?
124	Ross	 Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
125	Chandler	 Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
126	Monica	 It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
127	Ross	 Really?!
128	Chandler	 Really?!
129	Monica	 It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
130	Chandler	 (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
131	Monica	 Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
132	Chandler	 Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
133	Joey	 (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
134	Monica	 Chandler, this actually bothers you?
135	Chandler	 Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
136	Rachel	 Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
137	Ross	 And thank you, for that.
138	Rachel	 But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
139	Ross	 What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
140	Rachel	 Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
141	Ross	 All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!
142	Phoebe	 (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!
143	Rachel	 Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
144	Phoebe	 On your dresser.
145	Rachel	 Okay that is the one we already have!
146	Joey	 Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.
147	Monica	 What?
148	Joey	 (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
149	Chandler	 (smiling) Well, what is it?
150	Joey	 (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.
151	Rachel	 (smiling) What?!
152	Ross	 (smiling) Are you sure?
153	Phoebe	 (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?
154	Joey	 (smiling) Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
155	Rachel	 (smiling) Yeah.
156	Joey	 (smiling) I'm in it.
157		Commercial Break
158	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, it's continued from before the commercial break.]
159	Phoebe	 (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?
160	Joey	 (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
161	Phoebe	 (not smiling) That's not good.
162	Joey	 (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)
163	Rachel	 (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
164	Chandler	 (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
165	Grandma Tribbiani	 (Something in Italian to Joey.)
166	Joey	 Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)
167	Grandma Tribbiani	 (pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!
168	Joey	 No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
169	Grandma Tribbiani	 No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
170	Chandler	 Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
171		(Phoebe gets up.)
172	Monica	 (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
173	Phoebe	 But I already gave them back to you!
174	Monica	 No you didn't.
175	Phoebe	 All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?
176	Rachel	 It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
177	Phoebe	 Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
178	Rachel	 Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
179	Phoebe	 Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
180		(Rachel heads for Joey and Chandler's and Phoebe heads for the kitchen to find Ross.)
181	Ross	 (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
182	Phoebe	 (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
183	Ross	 Do you like it?
184	Phoebe	 No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
185	Ross	 Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
186	Phoebe	 Ohh! I did not get that.
187		[Cut to Chandler and Monica on the couch.]
188	Chandler	 So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
189	Monica	 Yeah, it's good.
190	Chandler	 See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
191	Monica	 Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
192	Chandler	 Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
193	Monica	 Go on, teach me something about men and women.
194	Chandler	 Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
195	Monica	 No way!
196	Chandler	 It's true.
197	Monica	 Well that's pathetic!
198	Chandler	 Again true.
199	Monica	 And this goes for all guys?
200	Chandler	 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
201	Joey	 (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
202	Ross	 Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!
203	Joey	 I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!
204	Monica	 No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
205	Joey	 (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)
206	Grandma Tribbiani	 Joey!
207	Chandler	 Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
208		[Time lapse, Rachel is coming back from Chandler and Joey's.]
209	Rachel	 (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
210	Phoebe	 Did you find it?
211	Rachel	 The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)
212	Phoebe	 Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
213	Rachel	 Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
214	Monica	 (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)
215	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
216	Rachel	 I don't know, I don't know.
217	Phoebe	 All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
218	Rachel	 Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
219	Phoebe	 I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
220	Rachel	 Ohh that'd be great!
221	Phoebe	 Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
222	Monica	 Yeah, what is it?
223	Phoebe	 Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
224	Monica	 (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
225	Phoebe	 I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
226	Monica	 All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
227	Phoebe	 No.
228	Monica	 Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
229	Phoebe	 Yeah! You're the best!
230	Rachel	 Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
231	Monica	 (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
232	Rachel	 Your sunglasses?!
233	Monica	 Yes!
234	Phoebe	 Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
235	Caitlin	 (from outside) Pizza!
236	Ross	 (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
237	Chandler	 Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
238	Rachel	 Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
239	Ross	 You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?
240	All	 Caitlin!
241	Grandma Tribbiani	 Caitlin!
242	Ross	 (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
243	Caitlin	 It's uh, $12.50.
244	Ross	 Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
245	Caitlin	 No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
246	Ross	 Gas? Wow! Intense.
247	Chandler	 (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
248	Ross	 (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
249	Caitlin	 (wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible, horrible place) Yeah.
250	Ross	 They put that in.
251	Caitlin	 What?!
252	Ross	 The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
253	Caitlin	 (getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!
254	Ross	 A lot of other gas smells…
255	Chandler	 Oh the humanity.
256	Ross	 Meth-methane smells…
257	Caitlin	 Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
258	Ross	 Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
259	Caitlin	 Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me! (Runs for her life.)
260		(Ross closes the door slowly.)
261	Ross	 (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
262	Chandler	 More so than anything else.
263	Phoebe	 I-I-I found it interesting.
264	Rachel	 I'm sorry.
265	Ross	 Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
266	Rachel	 Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
267	Phoebe	 (walking over to Ross) Ross?
268	Ross	 Yeah?
269	Phoebe	 What else do they add smell too?
270	[Scene	 The street outside the building, Rachel is running to catch up with Caitlin.]
271	Rachel	 Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
272	Caitlin	 Oh, is there a problem?
273	Rachel	 No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
274	Caitlin	 Oh my God! That was flirting?!
275	Rachel	 Yeah.
276	Caitlin	 Wow!
277	Rachel	 I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
278	Caitlin	 The guy with the gas?!
279	Rachel	 Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
280	Caitlin	 Really?!
281	Rachel	 Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
282	Caitlin	 I just, I thought Joey was there.
283	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey's grandmother are still watching Law & Order.]
284	Rachel	 (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
285	Ross	 What do you mean?
286	Rachel	 Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
287	Ross	 And she just gave you this?
288	Rachel	 Yeah!
289	Ross	 Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
290	Rachel	 I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
291	Ross	 Well that I can believe.
292	Rachel	 Yay!
293	Joey	 (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
294	Chandler	 Almost over man.
295	Joey	 (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
296	Chandler	 Why am I looking?
297	Joey	 Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
298		(Joey has made a little home movie that's his big scene. He braces himself against the door to his apartment and while holding a plastic gun and wearing the same sweater says…)
299	Joey	 (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
300	Grandma Tribbiani	 Oh Joey!
301	Joey	 That's right!
302	Chandler	 You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
303	Joey	 (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it…(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!
304	Phoebe	 Oh no!
305	Joey	 (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
306	Ross	 (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
307	Grandma Tribbiani	 Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)
308		(Suddenly, the tape cuts away from Joey's impromptu scene, to Chandler standing really, really close to the camera.)
309	Chandler	 (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown…engines…on!
310		(Joey and Chandler both run to shut off the tape.)
311	Joey	 (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
312	Phoebe	 I am definitely gonna watch that!
313		Ending Credits
314	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, another time lapse, Monica is seeking advice from Rachel and Phoebe about possible replacement earrings.]
315	Monica	 What about these? These look the same?
316	Phoebe	 Definitely!
317	Monica	 Not as each other!
318	Phoebe	 Oh, then no.
319		(Goes over to Chandler.)
320	Chandler	 (To Monica) Hey!
321	Monica	 Hi!
322	Chandler	 You ready?
323	Monica	 Yeah.
324	Chandler	 You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
325	Monica	 Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
326	Chandler	 Let me see the earrings.
327	Monica	 Oh, honey, the earrings…
328	Chandler	 (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
329	Monica	 My boyfriend really does have good taste!
330		(He turns to get his coat and Monica gives Rachel and Phoebe two thumbs up as Chandler walks over to Ross.)
331	Chandler	 (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
