2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there, the guys are watching football, the girls are cooking Thanksgiving dinner.]
3	The Guys	 (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
4	Phoebe	 Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
5	The Guys	 We will. (they don’t move)
6	Monica	 Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
7	Rachel	 No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
8		(Rachel sticks a marshmellow into Monica’s nose. Monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)
9	Monica	 Every year.
10		Opening Credits
11	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
12	Phoebe	 Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).
13	Ross	 Halftime.
14	Joey	 Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
15	Rachel	 Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
16	Phoebe	 Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.
17	Joey	 Great, you can cover Chandler.
18	Chandler	 No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.
19	Joey	 Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
20	Chandler	 That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!
21	Joey	 Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.
22	Chandler	 Yeah, all right, I’ll play.
23	Phoebe	 Yay!!
24	Rachel	 Let’s do it! Ross?
25	Ross	 What?
26	Rachel	 Do you wanna play football?
27	Ross	 Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.
28	Joey	 Says who? Your mom?
29	Monica and Ross	 Yeah.
30	Monica	 Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’
31	Chandler	 No, no, no, you say that proudly.
32	Monica	 Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.
33	Ross	 It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
34	Monica	 To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
35	Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
36	Monica	 (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
37	Ross	 Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
38	Rachel	 Um, there was a Geller Cup?
39	Ross	 Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
40	Chandler	 And was the curse lifted?
41	Ross	 Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
42	Monica	 Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.
43	Ross	 Can I see you for a second?
44		(they walk over to the sink and discuss it for a moment)
45	Monica	 (shouting) Once!!
46	Ross	 All right, we’re gonna play.
47	Chandler	 But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.
48	[Scene	 The Park, the gang is warming up for their football game.]
49	Monica	 Okay. Let’s bring it in.
50	Rachel	 Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
51	Ross	 Here you go. (throws her the ball)
52	Rachel	 (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.
53	Joey	 All right, we have to pick captains.
54	Chandler	 And then Tineals.
55	Phoebe	 Okay, so how do we decide that?
56	Monica	 Well, why don’t we just bunny up.
57	Rachel, Chandler, and Joey	 What?
58	Monica and Ross	 (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!
59	Monica	 Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
60	Joey	 Thank you.
61	Rachel	 Monica, I’m your best friend.
62	Ross	 Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.
63	Rachel	 Ross!
64	Monica	 Phoebe.
65		(Phoebe kisses Rachel on the cheek, then joins her team.)
66	Ross	 Sweetie, now I pick you.
67	Rachel	 You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!
68	Ross	 Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.
69	Monica	 All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
70	Chandler	 Wow! Just like in the pros.
71	Monica	 Huddle up.
72	Joey	 (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.
73	Phoebe	 Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
74	Monica	 Okay.
75	Phoebe	 Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
76	Monica	 Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?
77	Phoebe	 Yeah.
78	Monica	 Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
79	Phoebe	 What’s block?
80	Monica	 Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?
81	Phoebe	 I thought you meant in life.
82	Monica	 Break.
83		(Chandler is getting ready to kick off, Ross is holding the ball between his foot and finger.)
84	Chandler	 The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.)
85	Ross	 Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
86	Chandler	 Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.
87		(Chandler throws the ball to kick-off.)
88	Joey	 I got it. (catches the ball)
89	Phoebe	 Go! Go! Go!
90		(Joey runs up field and fakes out Ross and scores a touchdown. His team all celebrates the touchdown.)
91	Monica	 Score!! 7 to nothing!
92	Rachel	 (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?
93	Ross	 Come on, let’s go!
94	Monica	 Losers walk!
95	Ross	 Yeah, losers talk!
96	Chandler	 No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
97		[cut to later, Ross’s team has the ball.]
98	Chandler	 (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
99	Ross	 Yeah!
100	Chandler	 (from the shotgun) Hike!
101	Monica and Joey	 One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
102		(Rachel runs a quick slant.)
103	Rachel	 Over here!
104		(Chandler throws her the ball, which she drops.)
105	Rachel	 (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
106	Chandler	 Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
107	Ross	 Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
108	Rachel	 Wait, what am I gonna do?
109	Ross	 You, you go long.
110	Rachel	 Wait, how long?
111	Ross	 Until we start to look very small.
112	Rachel	 Okay.
113	Ross	 Break!!
114		[cut to later, Monica’s team has the ball.]
115	Joey	 Set....hike!
116	Ross	 One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
117	Chandler	 No, no, no, no, no!
118		(Monica throws the ball over Joey’s head, it’s stopped from rolling away by a very beautiful woman.)
119	Joey	 Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
120	Woman	 (in a foreign accent) You are playing American football?
121	Joey	 Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
122	Woman	 I’m Dutch.
123	Joey	 Hi-hi, I’m Joey.
124	Woman	 I’m Margha.
125	Joey	 I’m sorry Dutch, I didn’t get that last little bit.
126	Chandler	 (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler.
127	Margha	 Hello, Chandler.
128	Joey	 Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
129	Margha	 Margha.
130	Joey	 Mar-klan.
131	Margha	 Mar-gha.
132	Chandler	 Mar-haaaan.
133		[cut to Ross and Monica.]
134	Monica	 Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.
135	Ross	 Uh, hello, it’s third down.
136	Monica	 No it’s not, it’s second.
137	Ross	 Wow!
138	Monica	 Wow, what?
139	Ross	 It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
140	Monica	 Pulling what? It’s second down.
141	Ross	 Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.
142	Monica	 I heard that!
143	Ross	 Well, I said it loud.
144		[cut to Chandler, Joey, and Margha.]
145	Margha	 It is okay, if I stay and watch?
146	Chandler and Joey	 Yeah! Why don’t you stick around. You can sit right there.
147		(she goes and sits down)
148	Chandler	 Well, that went well.
149	Joey	 I think so.
150	Chandler	 Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
151	Joey	 Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
152	Chandler	 Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
153	Joey	 Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.
154	Chandler	 Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?
155	Joey	 Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.
156	Chandler	 Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.
157		[cut to later, in Ross’s huddle.]
158	Ross	 Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
159	Rachel	 Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
160	Ross	 Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
161	Rachel	 Can I see that for second.
162	Ross	 Yeah.
163		(Rachel takes the ball from his hands and bounces it off of Ross’s forehead and Chandler catches the rebound.)
164	Ross	 Okay. Hut! Hike!
165		(Chandler runs around behind Ross, who pitches him the ball. Chandler runs upfield, and Joey knocks the ball out of his hands.)
166	Joey	 Fumble!
167		(Joey starts to return the fumble and Chandler grabs Joey’s shirt and rips it off of his back.)
168	Joey	 What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
169	Chandler	 Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
170	Joey	 All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
171	Chandler	 Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!
172	Monica	 All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)
173	Phoebe	 Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
174	Joey	 Pheebs, run!
175	Monica	 Run, Phoebe, run!
176		(Phoebe runs and scores a touchdown.)
177	Phoebe	 Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
178	Ross	 Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.
179	Monica	 After the snap!
180	Ross	 Before the snap!
181	Joey	 After!!
182	Chandler	 Before!!
183	Rachel	 Now, does it really matter?
184	All	 Yes!!
185	Phoebe	 Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
186	Ross	 Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.
187	Monica	 Does so count!
188	Ross	 Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
189	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
190	Monica	 Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.
191	Ross	 Oh-ho, okay.
192	Monica	 Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
193	Ross	 Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
194	Phoebe	 Woo-yay!!
195	Monica	 No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.
196	Ross	 Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
197	Monica	 Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.
198	Ross	 Oh really! Why is that?
199		[cut to Monica and Rachel’s.]
200	Monica	 Because the winner gets this!
201	Ross	 The Geller Cup.
202	Chandler	 Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
203	All	 Yeah.
204	Chandler	 Okay, good.
205		Commercial Break
206	[Scene	 The park, the gang is returning to play the second half of the game.]
207	Ross	 Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
208	Monica	 When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
209	Ross	 That cup is mine!
210	Monica	 No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!
211	Rachel	 All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
212	Monica	 Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
213	Joey	 It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
214	Monica	 All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
215	Joey	 What are you gonna do?
216	Monica	 All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.
217	Joey	 Okay.
218	Monica	 Break!
219	Joey	 Here you go!
220		(Joey throws the ball to Chandler)
221	Ross	 Chandler! Chandler!
222		(Chandler catches the ball and starts to run upfield.)
223	Chandler	 (to Margha) Hi.
224		(just as he gets in front of Margha, Monica comes up and tackles him)
225	Monica	 Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?
226	Ross	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?
227	Monica	 What?! I just touched him and he went over.
228	Ross	 Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
229		(They both stare each other down as we hear ‘Let’s get ready to r-r-r-rum-ble!!!’)
230		(A long football sequence follows.)
231	[Sequence 1	 Monica throws the ball over Chandler’s head to Joey who catches it for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. Chandler then tackles him, and he starts to dance in celebration.]
232	[Sequence 2	 Monica runs upfield and stops, waiting for a pass. Ross runs over and pulls her pants down, steps in front of her and intercepts the pass.]
233	[Sequence 3	 Chandler throws a pass to Ross, who catches it. Phoebe starts screaming and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around his waist and screaming.]
234	[Sequence 4	 Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. Something hits her on the head and she looks up to see where it came from.]
235	[Sequence 5	 Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a fore-arm shiver to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...]
236	Phoebe	 I love this game!!
237		[cut to Ross who walks up to Rachel who is eating a baked pretzel.]
238	Ross	 Hey, where’d you get that?
239	Rachel	 I went really long.
240	Monica	 Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
241	Ross	 It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
242	Monica	 You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.
243		(Ross makes a ‘Yeah. Right.’ sound.)
244	Monica	 Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.
245	Ross	 What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.
246	Monica	 Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
247	Ross	 Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.
248	Rachel	 I can not believe your trading me!!
249	Monica	 Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.
250	Rachel	 Are you gonna let me play?
251	Monica	 All right then.
252		[cut to the guys’ team.]
253	Margha	 (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?
254	Chandler	 No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.
255	Joey	 Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.
256	Ross	 Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.
257	Chandler	 No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
258	Joey	 Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
259	Chandler	 And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
260	Joey	 Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
261	Margha	 Oh, my.
262	Ross	 Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.
263	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.
264	Chandler	 Fine with me.
265	Ross	 Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
266	Chandler and Joey	 What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
267	Margha	 Which do I like?
268	Ross	 Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
269	Margha	 Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
270	Chandler	 Yes!!
271	Joey	 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.
272	Chandler	 Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
273	Margha	 I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
274	Chandler	 You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
275	Margha	 I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
276	Chandler	 Wh-what?
277	Margha	 I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
278	Joey	 Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
279	Chandler	 Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
280	Ross	 Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
281	Chandler	 We’re not gonna lose to girls.
282	Ross	 Hey! It’s 42-21!
283	Joey	 This sucks, I was just up by that much!
284	Monica	 Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
285		[cut to the girls huddle.]
286	Monica	 We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...
287	Phoebe	 Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
288	Monica	 Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!
289	Rachel	 Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!
290	Phoebe	 All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
291		(Another football sequence follows)
292	[Sequence 1	 Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe flashes him, he stops and stares dumbfounded at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.]
293	[Sequence 2	 Phoebe throws the ball, and it’s intercepted by Joey, who starts to run up field. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she doesn’t slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]
294	[Sequence 3	 Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]
295		[cut to the girls huddle]
296	Monica	 All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
297	Rachel	 No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
298	Monica	 Honey, there’s a reason.
299	Rachel	 God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
300	Phoebe	 Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
301	Monica	 All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
302	Rachel	 Thank you! Break!
303	Monica	 Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
304		(Phoebe snaps the ball to Monica, who pitches back to Rachel.)
305	The Guys	 One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
306		(They all rush toward Rachel, who panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)
307	Rachel	 I’m so sorry! Are you okay?
308	Monica	 No! I’m not okay!
309	Rachel	 I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.
310	Joey	 (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
311	Chandler	 Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
312	Monica	 Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!
313	Phoebe	 Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
314	Monica	 All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
315	Rachel	 (on the verge of tears) Okay.
316	Monica	 Break!
317		(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see flying through the air, and then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the grace of Jerry Rice (no offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. Both Phoebe and Monica erupt in celebration.)
318	Rachel	 (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!
319	Chandler	 Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!
320	Phoebe	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.
321		(they all start to dive for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)
322	Ross	 Let go! Let go!
323	Monica	 Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!
324	Chandler	 Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
325	Monica	 Ow!!
326		Closing Credits
327	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are eating Thanksgiving dinner.]
328	Rachel	 We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.
329	Phoebe	 Isn’t there a national football league.
330	Chandler	 Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
331	Rachel	 Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
332	Phoebe	 Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
333	Joey	 When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.
334	[Scene	 The park, it’s dark outside and Monica and Ross are still fighting over the ball.]
335	Monica	 Let go!
336	Ross	 No! You let go!
337	Monica	 No!
338	Ross	 How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
