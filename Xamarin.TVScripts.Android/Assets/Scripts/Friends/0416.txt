2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there. Phoebe is stressing out about something.]
3	Monica	 What is it hon?
4	Phoebe	 I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.
5	Monica	 Aww, honey I’m sorry.
6	Phoebe	 God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.)
7	Chandler	 Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
8		[Cut to the bathroom, Joey is taking a shower and Phoebe knocks on the door.]
9	Joey	 Yeah?
10	Phoebe	 It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
11		(Joey sticks his head out of the shower curtain.)
12	Joey	 Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.
13	Phoebe	 (she smells his head) No!
14	Joey	 Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
15	Phoebe	 Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!
16	Joey	 Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it’s a pickle?!
17		(Phoebe grimaces at the smell.)
18		Opening Credits
19	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are there. Rachel is writing something on a pad, and then crumples it up and throws it on the floor.]
20	Chandler	 What are you writing?
21	Rachel	 Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
22	Chandler	 Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?
23		(Ross and Emily enter.)
24	Chandler	 Hi guys!
25	All	 Hey!
26	Joey	 Hey, what have you guys been up too?
27	Ross	 Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
28	Chandler	 Without me?!
29	Emily	 My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
30	Ross	 Yeah.
31	Emily	 They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a doorknob she has.)
32	Monica	 I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.
33	Emily	 I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. (Chandler is shocked.) It’s a joke. (They all laugh.)
34	Ross	 Bye. (They kiss.)
35	Emily	 Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya. Buh-bye then. (She leaves.)
36	Joey	 Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
37	Ross	 Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.
38	Monica	 Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
39	Ross	 Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.
40	Joey	 Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.
41	Chandler	 Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.
42		(Phoebe enters.)
43	Ross	 Pheebs!
44	All	 Hey!
45	Ross	 (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
46	Phoebe	 (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.
47	Chandler	 Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!
48	Phoebe	 Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
49	Joey	 Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
50	Phoebe	 That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.
51	[Scene	 Bloomingdale’s, Rachel is preparing to slip Joshua the note.]
52	Joshua	 (coming in from a changing room) Okay!
53	Rachel	 Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
54	Joshua	 Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable.
55	Rachel	 Yeah?
56	Joshua	 Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his hands in his pockets.)
57	Rachel	 (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
58	Joshua	 Why not?!
59	Rachel	 Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
60	Joshua	 Y’know, they ruin it for everybody.
61	Rachel	 I know!
62	Joshua	 Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
63	Rachel	 Oh?
64	Joshua	 Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
65	Rachel	 Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
66	Joshua	 No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know?
67	Rachel	 Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)
68	Joshua	 (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
69	Rachel	 Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.
70	Joshua	 Then uh, what’s-what’s this? (Shows her the real anti-theft device.)
71	Rachel	 You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)
72	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is writing on the Magna-Doodle as Rachel enters.]
73	Rachel	 Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
74	Chandler	 What are you talking about?
75	Joey	 Yeah, what’ going on?
76	Rachel	 We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
77	Ross	 Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.
78	Joey	 Awwww!
79	Emily	 (entering) Hello?
80	Rachel	 Surprise!!!
81	Chandler and Joey	 Surprise!!
82	Emily	 No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before!
83	Rachel	 Well, it was all Ross’s idea.
84	Emily	 You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!
85	Ross	 You really didn’t know?
86		[Cut to later, the party is in full swing. Rachel is in the kitchen and Chandler goes over to talk to her.]
87	Chandler	 Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)
88	Rachel	 Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.
89	Chandler	 Like what?
90		(Rachel laughs hysterically.)
91	Joey	 What-what-what is so funny?
92	Chandler	 I said, "Like what?"
93	Joey	 Now that’s a thinker.
94	Rachel	 Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
95	Joshua	 Hi!
96	Rachel	 Care for a cherry?
97	Joshua	 Oh, no thanks.
98	Rachel	 No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
99		(She tries to demonstrate this unique ability, but only succeeds in choking on it.)
100	Joshua	 You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)
101	Ross	 (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
102	Emily	 Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!
103	Ross	 Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.
104	Emily	 So why did you plan a party at the same time?
105	Ross	 No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!"
106	Emily	 But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
107	Ross	 Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
108		[Cut to Joey and Phoebe in the kitchen. Phoebe is watching Joey make a sandwich.]
109	Phoebe	 Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
110	Joey	 A little salami.
111	Phoebe	 Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
112	Joey	 Pastrami.
113	Phoebe	 Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.
114		(Rachel enters, she has changed clothes.)
115	Rachel	 Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
116	Joey	 Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
117	Rachel	 Up!
118	Monica	 You changed?
119	Rachel	 Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
120	Monica	 And lucky means, more cleavage?
121	Chandler	 Does for me.
122		(Joey starts wiping lint off of her back, but goes at little too far and Rachel just glares at him. He stops, gives her the ‘okay’ symbol and walks away.)
123	Rachel	 Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
124	Joey	 Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
125	Rachel	 What?
126	Joey	 There was a seen in Footloose...
127	Chandler	 Flashdance.
128	Joey	 Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…
129	Chandler	 She was a welder.
130	Joey	 What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
131	Monica	 Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
132	Rachel	 It’s not Christmas!
133	Monica	 Or Spin the Bottle?
134	Rachel	 He’s not 11!
135	Emily	 (with her coat on, she’s leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
136	Rachel	 What? You’re leaving?!
137	Ross	 Yes, we have something we have to get to.
138	Joshua	 Uhh, yeah, I think I’m going to take-off too.
139	Rachel	 No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
140	Ross	 What big thing?
141		[Cut to later, the whole group is seated on the floor and Rachel is explaining the rules of Spin the Bottle.]
142	Rachel	 (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this
143	Emily	 I’ll go.
144	All	 Yay!
145		(Emily spins the bottle and it lands on Joey.)
146	Joey	 Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
147		(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)
148	Monica	 Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)
149	Rachel	 Yay! Emily!
150		(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)
151	Chandler	 What are the odds? What are the odds?
152		(They both move to kiss again.)
153	Ross	 (stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.
154	Joey	 If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?
155	Rachel	 Okay, my turn!!
156		(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands on….wait for it….Joshua. (You thought I was going to say Ross, didn’t you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)
157	Phoebe	 Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
158	All	 Ohh!
159	Rachel	 It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!
160	All	 Oh my God!
161		(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from kissing Joshua.)
162	Rachel	 All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
163		(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down, Rachel pretends she’s knocking a bug off his leg.)
164	Rachel	 Just a bug.
165		Commercial Break
166	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, it is later in the party. The Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]
167	Phoebe	 Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.
168	Chandler	 Okay.
169		(He takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, Phoebe attacks the other end and starts devouring the sandwich.)
170	Chandler	 There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)
171	Joey	 Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
172	Phoebe	 I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
173	Joey	 All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?
174	Phoebe	 Yeah, totally!
175	Joey	 All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
176		[Cut to later, Phoebe is finishing off her steak.]
177	Joey	 Feel better now?
178	Phoebe	 Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.
179	Joey	 Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
180	Phoebe	 What?
181	Joey	 Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
182	Phoebe	 Yeah.
183	Joey	 Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.
184	Phoebe	 Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.
185	Joey	 Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?
186		[Cut to Ross and Emily standing by the foosball table.]
187	Ross	 Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
188		(Rachel enters, she has changed once again. This time into her high school cheerleading uniform.)
189	Emily	 But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit.
190	Monica	 Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
191	Rachel	 No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
192	Monica	 Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.
193	Joshua	 Hey!
194	Rachel	 Hi!
195	Joshua	 Nice uh, costume.
196	Rachel	 Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’
197	All	 E!
198	Rachel	 Gimme an ‘M!’
199	All	 M!
200	Rachel	 Gimme an ‘I!’
201	All	 I!
202	Rachel	 Gimme an ‘L!’
203	All	 L!
204	Rachel	 Gimme a ‘Y!’
205	All	 Y!
206	Rachel	 What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.)
207		(Joey and Monica rush over to her.)
208	Joey and Monica	 Are you all right?
209	Rachel	 I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?
210	Monica	 I think you’re done.
211	Joey	 Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)
212	Joshua	 Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
213	Joey	 (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
214	Rachel	 All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.
215	Joshua	 Okay.
216		(They both go to Chandler’s bedroom to get his coat.)
217		[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]
218	Gunther	 Rachel is my girlfriend.
219		[Cut to Chandler’s bedroom.]
220	Joshua	 So, this was uh, really fun.
221	Rachel	 Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)
222	Joshua	 Need uh, need a little hand there.
223	Rachel	 Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
224	Joshua	 You really don’t seem like you do. That’s…
225		(She is still yanking on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve. Finally, she gives up.)
226	Rachel	 Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
227	Joshua	 Well, what was supposed to happen?
228	Rachel	 Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
229	Joshua	 Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
230	Rachel	 Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!
231	Joshua	 No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
232	Rachel	 Why?!
233	Joshua	 Because I-I like you.
234	Rachel	 You like me?
235	Joshua	 Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.
236	Rachel	 Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
237	Joshua	 But…
238	Rachel	 Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
239	Joshua	 Okay uh, however…
240	Rachel	 Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.
241	Joshua	 My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet.
242	Rachel	 But….
243	Joshua	 I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time.
244	Rachel	 Okay.
245	[Scene	 The hallway, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of the guys apartment.]
246	Rachel	 Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.
247	Ross	 That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…
248	Rachel	 Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
249	Ross	 Yeah.
250	Rachel	 Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
251	Ross	 Helps a little.
252	Rachel	 Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
253	Ross	 Yeah, have a seat.
254	Rachel	 I’m so sorry.
255	Ross	 That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?
256	Rachel	 Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?
257	Ross	 What do you mean?
258	Rachel	 You seem to really like her.
259	Ross	 Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
260	Rachel	 Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
261	Ross	 You think?
262	Rachel	 Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
263	Ross	 Hey, you’re right.
264	Rachel	 Yeah.
265	Ross	 Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
266	Rachel	 I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
267	Ross	 Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
268	Rachel	 Hey.
269	Chandler	 Hey.
270	Rachel	 You’re a pathetic loser, right?
271	Chandler	 Oh-ho, yeah!
272	Rachel	 Sit!
273		(He does so, and immediately starts looking pathetic.)
274	Joshua	 Hi. (He has just returned.)
275	Rachel	 Oh my gosh, Joshua!
276	Joshua	 All those things I said about not being ready…
277	Rachel	 They’re not true?
278	Joshua	 No, they’re-they’re all true.
279	Rachel	 Oh.
280	Joshua	 But…
281	Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I love that but.
282		(They move to kiss, but realise that Chandler is staring at them. Chandler urges them on.)
283	Rachel	 You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
284	Joshua	 Yeah.
285	Rachel	 Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
286		Closing Credits
287	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next day. Phoebe is busy making a sandwich.]
288	Joey	 Oooh, what you got there?
289	Phoebe	 Pastrami.
290	Joey	 Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?
291	Phoebe	 Hm-mm, corn beef.
292	Joey	 Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
293	Phoebe	 Okay.
294	Joey	 (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
295	Phoebe	 Six months.
296	Joey	 Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
297	Phoebe	 Not if I get there first.
