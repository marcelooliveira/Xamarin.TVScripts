3	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler and Monica are looking through some papers.]
4	Chandler	 Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
5	Monica	 I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
6	Chandler	 I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
7	Monica	 I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
8	Chandler	 Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
9	Monica	 Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
10	Chandler	 You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
11	Monica	 Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
12	Chandler	 No! We're not borrowing money.
13	Monica	 Why not?
14	Chandler	 Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
15	Monica	 Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
16	Chandler	 That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. Mike and Phoebe seem to have finished watching a movie on television.]
19	Mike	 I'm gonna go. (He kisses Phoebe on the cheek)
20	Phoebe	 Why??
21	Mike	 I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
22	Phoebe	 Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
23	Mike	 I put that tube top on as a joke.
24	Phoebe	 I want you to stay.
25	Mike	 I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..
26	Phoebe	 Why don't you turn them inside ou...
27	Mike	 Done it. (Phoebe becomes a little more subdued) I'll be back in a couple of hours.
28	Phoebe	 I'll miss you.
29	Mike	 Me too. (He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
30	Phoebe	 Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
31	Mike	 No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
32	Phoebe	 Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
33	Mike	 So we're doing it?
34	Phoebe	 Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
35	Mike	 Yeah!
36	Phoebe	 I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
37	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Monica enters.]
38	Monica	 Hey Joey!
39	Joey	 Hey!
40	Monica	 Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
41		(Joey frowns...then looks as if he understands)
42	Joey	 I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
43	Monica	 (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
44	Joey	 Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
45	Monica	 But Chandler lent you money!
46	Joey	 And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
47	Monica	 Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
48	Joey	 Oh...how much?
49	Monica	 Two thousand dollars?
50	Joey	 Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
51	Monica	 Yeah...
52	Joey	 That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
53	Rachel	 Hi you guys!
54	Joey & Monica	 Hey!
55	Joey	 Oo...what's in the bag?
56	Rachel	 Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
57	Joey	 Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
58	Monica	 Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
59	Rachel	 No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
60	Joey	 You're gonna do it?
61	Rachel	 Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
62	Joey	 Oh, women can. You can't.
63	Rachel	 Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
64	Monica	 You're a pig. And you can't do this.
65	Rachel	 Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
66	Joey	 The hardware store is right down the street.
67	Rachel	 There is a hardware store right down the street?
68	[Scene	 Central Perk. Ross, Chandler and Monica are sitting on the couch. Phoebe and Mike enters.]
69	Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
70	Mike	 Phoebe and I are moving in together.
71	Monica, Chandler, Ross	 Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
72	Phoebe	 I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
73	Monica	 Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like" (Looks at Chandler)
74	Chandler	 Yeah.... she's not so cute.
75	Mike	 I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
76	Phoebe	 Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
77	Mike	 Yes dear.
78	Monica	 Is that a bit you guys do?
79	Phoebe	 Uh huh...we're playing you two.
80	Monica	 We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
81	Chandler	 Yes dear.
82	Ross	 I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
83	Monica	 I hear wedding bells.
84	Phoebe	 Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
85	Ross	 Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
86	Phoebe	 I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
87	Mike	 You ready to go?
88	Phoebe	 Yeah! You bet roomy!
89	Monica	 Don't you mean..groomy?
90	Mike	 What are you talking about?
91	Phoebe	 Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
92	Phoebe	 China patterns!!!!!
93	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Rachel is fiddling with the drawer.]
94	Rachel	 This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)
95	[Scene	 Central Perk. Chandler sits on the couch. Joey sits at the round table]
96	Chandler	 Hey Joe!
97	Joey	 Hey!
98	Chandler	 Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
99	Joey	 I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
100	Chandler	 And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
101	Joey	 Yeah, I know.
102	Chandler	 What? What do you mean you know?
103	Joey	 Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
104	Chandler	 Oh! Right.
105	Joey	 (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
106	Chandler	 Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
107	Joey	 Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
108	Chandler	 Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)
109	Joey	 Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
110	Chandler	 Oh ok.
111	Joey	 (To himself) I am on fire!
112	Chandler (Stands up and walks to Joey)	 Listen...this is really nice. Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
113	Joey	 Err... Kind of.
114	Chandler	 I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
115	Joey	 Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
116	Chandler	 What?
117	Joey	 Something personal.
118	Chandler	 What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
119		(Woman with huge breasts cuts across them. Takes Joey's coffee)
120	Woman	 Excuse me.
121	Joey	 Boob job.
122	Monica	 I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
123	Joey	 Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
124	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.]
125	Mike	 Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
126	Phoebe	 Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
127	Mike	 I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
128	Phoebe	 Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
129	Mike	 Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
130	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
131	Mike	 Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
132	Phoebe	 Oh. Wow.
133	Mike	 It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
134	Phoebe	 Was it really that bad?
135	Mike	 At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
136	Phoebe	 Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
137	Mike	 Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
138	Phoebe	 But it's just...
139	Mike	 Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
140	Phoebe	 Oh!
141	Mike	 I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
142	Phoebe	 No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
143	Mike	 Trust me, I will never...
144	Phoebe	 Yeah I get that.
145	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Rachel is flipping through magazines. Handyman is installing things. Monica enters.]
146	Rachel	 Hi!
147	Monica	 So you gave in and decided to call someone?
148	Rachel	 Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
149	Handyman	 You're all set. (picks up his bag and starts to leave)
150	Rachel	 Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
151	Handyman	 Thanks.....
152		(Chandler enters)
153	Chandler	 Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
154	Rachel	 Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
155	Monica	 Thank you?
156	Chandler	 Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
157	Monica	 Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
158	Chandler	 No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
159	Monica	 Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
160	Chandler	 Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
161	Monica	 Okay...
162	Chandler	 I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
163		(He leaves)
164	Rachel	 Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
165	Monica	 I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
166	Rachel	 I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
167	Monica	 Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
168	Rachel	 No you really think that's what it is?
169	Monica	 You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
170	Rachel	 Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!
171	[Scene	Ross's apartment. Phoebe is at the door.]
172	Phoebe	 Hi
173	Ross	 Hey!
174	Phoebe	 Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
175	Ross	 Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
176	Phoebe	 No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
177	Ross	 Why?
178	Phoebe	 Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
179	Ross	 Never?
180	Phoebe	 Never.
181	Ross	 wow, are you still going to move in with him?
182	Phoebe	 I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
183	Ross	 Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
184	Phoebe	 That's not how you really feel is it?
185	Ross	 No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
186	Phoebe	 Seriously? You divorce-o?
187	Ross	 If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
188	Phoebe	 It's ok that's how you feel.
189	Ross	 But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
190	Phoebe	 I do love Mike.
191	Ross	 Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
192	Phoebe	 Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
193	Ross	 The Divorcer, to the rescue!
194	Phoebe	 It's not cooler.
195	Ross	 Yeah I just hurt it.
196	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Joey enters carrying a tub of ice cream. He sets it on the table, takes off his jacket and struggles with the drawer. It cannot be opened.]
197	Joey	 Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????
198	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler enters. Rachel and monica are seated at the table.]
199	Chandler	 Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
200	Monica	 Honey?
201	Chandler	 Yeah?
202	Monica	 About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
203	Chandler	 But honey you don't have to.
204	Monica	 I'm going to get bigger!
205	Chandler	 Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
206	Rachel	 Argh. fascist
207	Monica	 Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
208	Chandler	 your ass?!?!?
209	Rachel	 Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
210	Chandler	 They...do that?
211	Monica	 It's kind of a package deal!
212	Chandler	 God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
213	Monica	 I thought I was something that we both wanted!
214	Chandler	 Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
215	Rachel	 Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
216	Chandler	 (sedated) What?
217	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. He's prying open the drawer with a crowbar to no avail. Monica, Rachel and Chandler enter.]
218	Rachel	 Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
219	Joey	 Because she is!
220	Monica	 Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
221	Joey	 Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
222	Monica, Rachel, Chandler	 It's over/Joe!
223	Joey	 OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
224	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. Ross is helping with the packing, Phoebe and Mike are also there.]
225	Ross	 Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross
226	Phoebe	 Better.
227	Mike	 Very cool.
228	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
229	Phoebe	 Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
230	Ross	 Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
231	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
232	Ross	 Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
233	Phoebe	 They are awfully boxy...
234	Ross	 I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
235	Phoebe	 Uh huh.
236		(Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are carrying a couch through the door)
237	Ross	 Hey hey, can I help?
238	Chandler	 Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
239	Ross	 You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
240	Joey	 Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
241	Rachel	 Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
242	Phoebe	 Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
243	Mike	 No but... You don't want to get married either right?
244	Phoebe	 Right. Except that I do want to get married.
245	Joey	 (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
246	Mike	 You wanna get married?
247	Phoebe	 Someday.
248	Chandler	 Aaaaand....... hernia.
249	Phoebe	 I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
250	Mike	 But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
251	Phoebe	 Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
252	Mike	 I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
253	Phoebe	 But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
254	Mike	 Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
255	Phoebe	 Are you gonna change yours?
256	Mike	 No.
257	Phoebe	 Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
258	Mike	 But I don't want this to end.
259	Phoebe	 I don't want it to end either.
260	Mike	 I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
261	Phoebe	 Yeah.
262	Mike	 Ok... so...(They hug) Goodbye.
263	Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica	 Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
264	Rachel	 I'm so sorry Pheebs.
265	Monica	 We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
266	Chandler	 Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
