9	[Scene	 Central Perk]
10	Monica	 (she enters) Hey guys!
11	Ross, Rachel and Chandler	 Hey!
12	Chandler	 Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
13	Monica	 That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
14	Rachel	 Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
15	Ross	 Yeah!
16	Rachel	 We're having a party.
17	Monica	 Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
18	Ross	 No.
19	Rachel	 No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
20	Chandler	 Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
21	Ross	 C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
22	Monica	 Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
23	Chandler	 There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
24	Rachel	 Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
25	Ross	 Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
26	Rachel	 And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
27	Monica	 All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
28	Chandler	 Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
29	Monica	 Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
30	OPENING CREDITS [Scene	 Rachel and Joey's apartment] Rachel
31	Phoebe	 Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
32	Ross	 (he enters) Hey guys!
33	Rachel and Phoebe	 Hi!
34	Ross	 Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
35	Rachel	 Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
36	Phoebe	 Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
37	Ross	 Yeah!
38	Phoebe	 Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
39	Ross	 That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
40	Rachel	 Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
41	Ross	 Ah, and where is Joey?
42	Rachel	 I said it's still nap time.
43		(Joey comes out from his room, yawning)
44	Ross	 (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!
45	Joey	 Hey!
46	Ross	 Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
47	Joey	 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'" line)
48	Ross	 Joey, NO!
49	Joey	 What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
50	Ross	 When they see this you'll be 52!
51	Joey	 And starting to think about settling down!
52	Rachel	 Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
53	Joey	 I'd love to! Yeah!
54	Joey	 (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?
55	Phoebe	 Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
56	Joey	 Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
57	Phoebe	 Joey, it's a birthday party.
58	Joey	 Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!
59		(Monica and Chandler enter)
60	Monica	 Hey!
61	Chandler	 Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
62	Rachel	 Oh, she's still napping
63	Chandler	 Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
64	Rachel	 Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
65	Monica	 All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
66	Rachel	 No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
67	Monica	 Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
68		(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)
69	Jack and Judy	 HI!
70	Ross	 (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!
71	Monica	 So glad you came!
72	Jack	 I can't believe Emma is already one!
73	Judy	 (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
74	Ross	 (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!
75	Joey	 Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
76	Jack	 Thank you!
77	Joey	 Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
78	Jack	 Which one are you?
79		(Later...)
80	Monica	 I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
81	Chandler	 I know, what are we gonna do?
82	Monica	 I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
83	Chandler	 I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
84	Joey	 Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!
85	Phoebe	 So you’re gonna... hit on her?
86	Joey	 No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
87	Phoebe	 Oh!
88	Joey	 You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
89	Phoebe	 Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
90	Joey	 Hey, I think Emma might like it!
91	Rachel	 Oh! Emma might like what?
92	Joey	 Um, my present!
93	Rachel	 What did you get her?
94	Joey	 Actually we prepared performances.
95	Phoebe	 Separate performances.
96	Joey	 But equally real!
97	Rachel	 Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
98	Phoebe	 Sure, yeah!
99	Joey	 (unconfidently) O K.
100	Rachel	 (to everybody) All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
101	Ross	 Oh, great!
102	Phoebe	 (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
103	Joey	 Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
104	Rachel	 So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
105	Joey	 I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
106	Rachel	 Oh, ok, which one?
107	Joey	 Uh, why, it’s a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.
108	Rachel	 (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
109	Ross	 Thank you so much for that gift!
110	Chandler (nearly weeping)	 I was not ready for this today!
111	Ross	 Amazing... amazing.
112	Rachel	 Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
113	Phoebe	 That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
114	Rachel	 Is that it?
115	Phoebe	 No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.
116	Everybody	 No, no, no, no, no!
117	[Scene	 Joey’s Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ] Judy
118	Jack	 Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
119	Judy	 Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.
120	Jack	 That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
121	Judy	 After all, my parents died very young.
122	Jack	 And my cholesterol’s off the charts!
123	Judy	 Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
124	Ross (stops recording)	 Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
125	Rachel	 Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
126	Ross	 Sure.
127	Rachel	 Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.
128	Monica	 Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
129	Rachel	 Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
130	Monica	 Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
131	Rachel	 Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
132	Ross	 Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
133	Rachel	 Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
134	Phoebe (sees the cake)	 oh! Now it’s a party!
135	Rachel	 Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
136	Joey (staring at the cake)	 Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
137	Judy	(to Jack) Jack, look at this.
138	Jack	 I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
139	Ross	 I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
140	Rachel (on the phone)	 No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
141	Ross	 Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
142	Rachel	 Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!
143	Joey	 I'm so confused!
144	Rachel	 (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
145	Chandler	 To be fair this one does have nuts.
146		(Later...)
147		(Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area)
148	Ross	 Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
149	Monica	 Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
150	Ross	 Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!
151	Chandler	 Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
152	Monica	 We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
153	Chandler	 We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
154	Monica	 Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
155	Phoebe	 And you know, I have a massage client soon.
156	Ross	 You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
157	Monica	 Alright, 5 more minutes.
158		(The phone rings, Ross picks up)
159	Ross	 (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)
160	Chandler	 Was that Emma? Is she up?
161	Ross	 No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
162	Phoebe	 Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
163	Monica	 No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!
164	Ross	 No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
165	Chandler	 I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
166	Ross	 Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
167	Joey	 Got it! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?
168	Chandler	 To the bathroom!
169	Joey	 Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
170	Phoebe	 Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
171	Chandler	 (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)
172	Joey	 Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
173	Phoebe	 No, it did not.
174	Joey	 No.
175	Judy	 Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
176	Jack	 Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
177	Judy	 Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
178	Joey	 Ok! (Opens the door for them)
179	Judy	 Bye... Bye dear.
180	Joey	 Nighty-night!
181	Judy	 Nighty-night!
182	Joey	 Bye, bye.
183	Phoebe	 Joey? How could you just let them leave?
184	Joey	 Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
185	Monica	 No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
186	Joey	 (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)
187	Chandler	 You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
188	Joey	 Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
189		(The phone rings, Joey picks up)
190	Joey	 Hello?
191	Estelle	 (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!
192	Joey	 Hey! (smiles)
193	Estelle	 So, how did your audition go today?
194	Joey	 (smile fades) What audition?
195	Estelle	 The one I told you about last week?
196	Joey	 What? You never said anything about an audition!
197	Estelle	 (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
198	Joey	 A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
199	Phoebe	 Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
200	Monica	 Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
201	Phoebe	 Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
202	Monica	 No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
203	Joey	 Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
204	Monica	 (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.
205	Joey	 Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
206	Phoebe	 No, lets just draw straws.
207	Joey	 Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
208	Chandler	 I'm begging you stop.
209	Joey	 Right.
210	Monica	 Ok, how about this
211	Phoebe	 (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!
212	Chandler	 (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
213	Monica	 Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)
214	Phoebe	 Ok! I want the dolphin!
215	Chandler	 Thats a bear.
216	Phoebe	 I'm too excited!
217	Monica	 Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
218	Joey	 Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)
219	Chandler	 Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
220		(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)
221	Phoebe	 Go! Go!
222	Joey	 Come on robot!
223		(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, sits, walks again, and so on... )
224	Monica	 (to the dog) What are you barking at?
225		(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)
226	Monica	 Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
227	Chandler	 I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
228		(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)
229	Joey	 Way to go robot!
230	Phoebe	 Good job Alan!
231	Joey	 Hey, good race you guys.
232	Phoebe	 Yeah, see you later!
233		(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)
234	Monica	 No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
235	Chandler	 They left.
236		(Monica turns to see the closed door.)
237	[ Scene	 The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]
238	Rachel	 (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...
239		(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)
240	Ross	 RACHEL!
241	Rachel	 OOH! God! Sorry!
242	Ross	 (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
243		(Ross fastens his seat belt.)
244	Rachel	 Emma's awake.
245	Ross	 Yeah?
246	Rachel	 I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
247	Ross	 Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)
248	Rachel	 Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
249	Ross	 Rach, she's not going to remember this.
250	Rachel	 (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
251	Ross	 (looks back at the cake) Hey!
252	Rachel	 What?
253	Ross	 It's not bad.
254	Rachel	 (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
255	Ross	 Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
256	Rachel	 Well, I'm very impressed.
257	Ross	 Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
258	[ Scene	 Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]
259	Monica	 Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
260	Chandler	 I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
261	Monica	 Game?
262	Chandler	 Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
263		(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and babbles...)
264	Chandler	 Ooh! That's my girl!
265	Monica	 That's how old you are.
266	Chandler	 Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
267	Monica	 (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...
268	Chandler	 Me too...
269		(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)
270	Chandler	 There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
271	Monica	 ...and head to Canada!
272	Chandler	 I was kidding.
273	Monica	 I wasn't. Let's get going!
274		(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)
275	Phoebe	 Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
276	Chandler	 No, not yet.
277	Phoebe	 Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
278	Monica	 What about your massage client?
279	Phoebe	 I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
280		(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)
281	Joey	 Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
282		(Ross and Rachel enter.)
283	Joey	 (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!
284	Ross	 Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
285	Rachel	 I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
286	Chandler	 Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
287	Rachel	 What?
288	Chandler	 Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
289	Emma	 Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)
290		(Ross and Rachel gasp)
291	Rachel	 Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
292	Ross	 Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
293	Rachel	 (angrily) NO, no science camp!
294	Ross	 Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
295	Rachel	 Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
296	Monica	 Thanks!
297	Ross	 Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
298	Chandler	 Let's do it, come on!
299		(Rachel wipes away some tears.)
300	Ross	 What's wrong? Are you okay?
301	Rachel	 Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
302	Phoebe	 (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.
303	Joey	 What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
304	ENDING CREDITS [Scene	 Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front of the camera.] Rachel
305	Ross	 Okay, you ready?
306	Rachel	 Yeah.
307	Ross	 A-a-and... record.
308	Rachel	 Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
309		(There's a lot of yelling and screaming coming from the hallway, and they get up to look at what's the noise all about. In the hallway, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are having another wind-up animal race, yelling and screaming fanatically.)
310	Phoebe	 (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you hairy bastard!
311		END
