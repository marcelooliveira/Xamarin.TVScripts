3	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is talking to Ross]
4	Joey	 There’s this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y’know? ’Ccause we’re really good friends.
5	Ross	 So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?
6	Joey	 Yeah, he’s the best.
7	Ross	 Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
8	Joey	 Oh, I don’t know.
9	Ross	 Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
10	Joey	 I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—
11	Ross	 Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until…)
12	Joey	 It’s Rachel.
13		[Fade to Black, then fade in again with Ross stopped at the doorway.]
14	Ross	 (closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?
15	Joey	 Yes.
16	Ross	 Um, you…you like Rachel?
17	Joey	 Yes. I like Rachel.
18	Ross	 Rachel?!
19	Joey	 (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.
20	Ross	 But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
21	Joey	 Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.
22	Ross	 It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
23	Joey	 I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
24	Ross	 Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
25	Joey	 Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.
26	Ross	 Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
27	Joey	 Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
28	Ross	 (stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!
29		(He exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says "Rachel?!" again. Joey sighs and turns around to face Gunther.)
30	Gunther	 Rachel?!!
31		Opening Credits
32	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel and Chandler are on the couch.]
33	Rachel	 Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!
34	Chandler	 Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.
35	Rachel	 Whoa!!
36	Chandler	 Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
37	Rachel	 Wow that was a big one.
38	Chandler	 I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
39	Phoebe	 (entering) Oh hey you guys!
40	Chandler	 Oh hey!
41	Rachel	 Hi!
42	Phoebe	 Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
43	Rachel	 Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
44	Phoebe	 Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?
45	Chandler	 No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.
46	Phoebe	 Okay, good.
47	Chandler	 Why?
48	Phoebe	 Well last night, I met Monica’s.
49	Chandler	 What?
50	Phoebe	 Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
51	Chandler	 Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
52	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Well, what’s he like?!
53	Phoebe	 Well he’s tall.
54	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
55	Phoebe	 He has brown hair.
56	Rachel	 Of course, of course.
57	Chandler	 A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
58	Phoebe	 He works with food!
59	Rachel	 Oh sure. Older?
60	Phoebe	 Obviously, and he’s British.
61	Rachel	 Oh, I was just gonna ask!
62	Phoebe	 Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
63	Rachel	 Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
64	Chandler	 Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
65	Phoebe	 Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.
66	Chandler	 You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
67	Phoebe	 Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.
68	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's, Ross is opening the door to Monica.]
69	Monica	 Hey.
70	Ross	 Hey.
71	Monica	 I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.
72	Ross	 Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
73	Monica	 All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.
74	Ross	 Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
75	Monica	 Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.
76	Ross	 Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.
77	Monica	 Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!
78	Ross	 He’s not?
79	Monica	 No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.
80	Ross	 Why?
81	Monica	 He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
82	Ross	 Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?
83	Monica	 Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.
84	Ross	 Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.
85	Monica	 All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
86	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch as Phoebe enters with Monica’s soul mate.]
87	Phoebe	 Oh! Hi!
88	Monica	 Hi!
89	Phoebe	 Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
90	Don	 Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler’s hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica’s hand.)
91	Phoebe	 (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
92	Chandler	 (mouths to Phoebe) What?
93	Phoebe	 (cough talks) Soul mate.
94	Monica	 So, what have you guys been doing?
95	Don	 Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
96	Monica	 I know! What is this, 1985?!
97	Don	 That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange.
98	Monica	 Not really.
99	Chandler	 What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?
100	Monica	 So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
101	Don	 Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place, Alessandro’s.
102	Monica	 Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.
103	Don	 You’re kidding me!
104	Monica	 No!
105	Don	 Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
106	Monica	 Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.
107		(They go over to the counter and Chandler moves closer to Phoebe.)
108	Chandler	 What are you doing?!
109	Phoebe	 Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
110	Chandler	 I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
111	Phoebe	 They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
112	Monica	 (returning) Phoebe, good work.
113	Phoebe	 Yeah?
114	Monica	 Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)
115	Phoebe	 Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.
116	[Scene	 Joey’s Apartment, there’s a knock on the door and Joey answers it to Ross.]
117	Joey	 Hey.
118	Ross	 Hey.
119	Joey	 Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
120	Ross	 No, I don’t want to hit you.
121	Joey	 Oh what then? Kick me?
122	Ross	 No.
123	Joey	 (getting worried) Bite me?
124	Ross	 No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
125	Joey	 Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
126	Ross	 Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)
127	Joey	 Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…
128	Ross	 Okay.
129	Joey	 (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
130	Ross	 Thank you.
131		(They clink glasses and take a drink. Ross likes it, Joey hates it. Then Ross sees Joey hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)
132	Joey	 Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…
133	Ross	 What?! You’re in love with her.
134	Joey	 Yeah, I thought you knew that.
135	Ross	 Umm, no.
136	Joey	 Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I’ll get over this." Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?
137		(Pause)
138	Ross	 I think you need to tell her how you feel.
139	Joey	 Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.
140	Ross	 No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
141	Joey	 But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…
142	Ross	 If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
143	Joey	 Are you sure?
144	Ross	 Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
145	Joey	 Hey thanks.
146	Ross	 So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
147	Joey	 Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
148	Ross	 I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
149	Joey	 I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!
150	Ross	 Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)
151		Commercial Break
152	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Chandler are watching Monica and Don talk.]
153	Don	 …so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
154	Chandler	 Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
155	Don	 Excuse me?
156	Chandler	 Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
157	Don	 Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
158	Monica	 Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
159	Don	 And you’re still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries to but fails.)
160	Monica	 You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.
161	Don	 Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.
162	Chandler	 Is it made of cheese?
163	Don	 No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!
164	Monica	 I’d move in tomorrow!
165	Chandler	 (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
166	Phoebe	 I’m so sorry.
167	Chandler	 What do we do?
168	Phoebe	 I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.
169	[Scene	 Outside Ross and Rachel's, Joey walks up to knock on the door, but stops.]
170	Joey	 Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
171	Rachel	 Joey? What’s up?
172	Joey	 I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
173	Rachel	 Okay what’s up?
174	Joey	 Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
175	Rachel	 Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
176	Joey	 Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.
177	Rachel	 Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
178	Joey	 Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!
179	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
180	Monica	 I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?
181	Chandler	 Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
182	Monica	 Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.
183	Chandler	 Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
184	Monica	 Jeez! What is with you?
185	Chandler	 I’m sorry, did you say cheese?
186	Monica	 All right, what’s going on?
187	Chandler	 Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
188	Monica	 Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?
189	Chandler	 No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
190	Monica	 I don’t believe in soul mates either.
191	Chandler	 You don’t?
192	Monica	 No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
193	Chandler	 So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
194	Monica	 No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
195	Chandler	 I love you.
196	Monica	 I know.
197	Chandler	 Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
198	[Scene	 A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are having dinner.]
199	Rachel	 …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
200	Joey	 What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhales slowly)—Is it hot in here?
201	Rachel	 No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?
202	Joey	 I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
203	Rachel	 Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
204	Joey	 Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
205	Rachel	 Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.
206	Joey	 Uh… How long have we known each other?
207	Rachel	 Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
208	Joey	 Uh-huh, long time.
209	Rachel	 Yeah.
210	Joey	 But over the past few weeks…
211		(A waiter runs over interrupting Joey.)
212	Waiter	 Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight…
213	Joey	 Actually uh, could you give us a second?
214	Waiter	 Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Second’s up! (Joey glares at him.) Not…that kind of table. (He walks away.)
215	Rachel	 So you were saying?
216	Joey	 I’m not quite sure.
217	Rachel	 Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.
218	Joey	 Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.
219	Rachel	 (stunned) What?
220	Joey	 I’m falling in love with you.
221	Rachel	 (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh, it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?
222	Joey	 Does it really matter?
223	Rachel	 Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
224	Joey	 Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay, you gotta say something!
225	Rachel	 Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…
226	Joey	 But. (Hangs his head down.)
227	Rachel	 Joey.
228	Joey	 Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go. (Stands up.)
229	Rachel	 No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
230	Joey	 Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)
231	Rachel	 Can I? (Hug him.)
232	Joey	 Sure!
233		(They hug.)
234	Rachel	 Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
235	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!
236	Rachel	 I’m so sorry.
237	Joey	 Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry. (They hug again.) Y’know I was only kidding you.
238	Rachel	 Yeah, that was a real good one.
239		Closing Credits
240	[Scene	 A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are still hugging as a waiter walks by the table to talk to the annoying waiter from before who is watching.]
241	Waiter No. 2	 Is this your table?
242	Waiter	 Yeah.
243	Waiter No. 2	 God, you’re gonna be here all night!
244	Waiter	 I know! I haven’t even read them the specials yet!
245	Waiter No. 2	 What’s the matter with them?
246	Waiter	 I don’t know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda hope it’s the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!
247		End
