2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there, Rachel is serving brownies.]
3	Rachel	 Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
4	Chandler	 I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
5		(Phoebe takes a bite and spits it out and screams.)
6	Chandler	 Okay, I’m not gonna have one.
7	Ross	 Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
8	Phoebe	 No, no, it’s just my tooth.
9	Chandler	 All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)
10	Ross	 So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.
11	Phoebe	 No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.
12	Chandler	 See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
13	Ross	 Why? Why can’t you go to him?
14	Phoebe	 Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
15	Chandler	 That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.
16	Rachel	 Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
17	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.
18	Rachel	 And all these people actually died?
19	Phoebe	 Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
20	Ross	 Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.
21	Phoebe	 Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
24	Ross	 Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?
25	Gunther	 Oh, like you don’t already have everything.
26	Phoebe	 (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
27	Rachel	 Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
28	Phoebe	 All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
29	Rachel	 I promise.
30	Phoebe	 Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.
31	Joey	 (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
32	Ross	 (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s not.
33	Monica	 You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
34	Ross	 What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
35	Joey	 Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
36	Rachel	 Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
37	Joey	 It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.
38	Phoebe	 Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him.
39	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, All are there except for Chandler.]
40	Joey	 (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
41	Phoebe	 Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
42	Ross	 Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
43	Joey	 What did they do?
44	Ross	 Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.
45	Monica	 So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
46	Ross	 Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.
47	Rachel	 Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
48	Ross	 You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
49	Joey	 Hey-hey, Ross?
50	Ross	 Yeah.
51	Joey	 I’ve got a science question.
52	Ross	 Hmm?
53	Joey	 If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?
54	Ross	 Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
55	Joey	 Hey-hey, I’m not judging.
56	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are babysitting Ben.]
57	Rachel	 (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored.
58	Monica	 Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We’re gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits Ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)
59		[cut to later]
60	Monica	 (to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are, you’re so brave.
61	Rachel	 Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
62	Monica	 He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.
63	Rachel	 We’re not?!
64	Monica	 No we’re not.
65	Rachel	 All right, I like that.
66	Monica	 Okay.
67	Rachel	 So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump, there’s a bump.
68	Monica	 Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
69	Rachel	 I cannot push it in!
70	Monica	 Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.
71	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay.
72	Monica	 I got it!
73	Rachel	 Okay.
74	Monica	 The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
75	Rachel	 Or. We could put a hat on his head.
76	Monica	 A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
77	Rachel	 We need a hat..
78	Monica	 Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
79	Rachel	 Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)
80	Monica	 Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you’re a genius!
81	Rachel	 Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.
82	Monica	 Give it. Give it.
83	Rachel	 Okay.
84		(Monica takes the bear, grabs his hat, and rips off his head.)
85	Monica and Rachel	 Oh!!
86	Rachel	 Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.
87	[Scene	 The street, Chandler and Joey are walking past a jewelery store.]
88	Chandler	 Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
89	Joey	 I’d really prefer a mountain bike.
90	Chandler	 Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
91	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
92	Chandler	 That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.
93	Joey	 Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
94	Chandler	 All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
95	Joey	 (stopping him) No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.
96	Chandler	 Why not?!
97	Joey	 Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
98	Chandler	 What is the thing?
99	Joey	 Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
100	Chandler	 (shocked) What?
101	Joey	 They were in his office.
102	Chandler	 Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.
103	Joey	 I’m telling you man, I saw it.
104	Chandler	 Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.
105	Joey	 I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?
106	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are dressing up Ben in the entire rain suit from Rainy Day Bear.]
107	Monica	 It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
108	Rachel	 Right.
109	Monica	 Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
110	Phoebe	 (running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!
111	Rachel	 See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?
112	Phoebe	 Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
113	Monica	 Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
114	Phoebe	 (on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’
115	Ben	 Monica.
116	Monica	 Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
117	Ben	 Monica bang!
118	Rachel	 Okay, I heard that.
119	Monica	 Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?
120	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
121	Monica	 Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!
122	Ben	 Monica bang!
123	Monica	 Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It’s no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t that fun?
124	Rachel	 (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I’m stopping now.
125	Monica	 You okay?
126	Rachel	 Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth it.
127	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is waiting for Janice to arrive, and is angrily fllipping through a magazine.]
128	Janice	 (entering) How’s my Bing-a-ling?
129	Chandler	 Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
130	Janice	 Why are your eyes so white?
131	Chandler	 You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
132	Janice	 Oh my God!!
133	Chandler	 All right!
134	Janice	 How did you know?
135	Chandler	 Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
136	Janice	 In the park?
137	Chandler	 No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
138	Janice	 Just those two!
139	Chandler	 Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
140	Janice	 Oh, I’m sorry honey, I’m so, so, (nasally) haaaaa! I’m so, so sorry, I just (nasally) haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can’t breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
141	Chandler	 (giving her a bag) Here.
142		(Janice starts to breath into it and sucks in the reciept, and then spits it out.)
143	Janice	 The receipt.
144	Chandler	 I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
145	Janice	 I don’t know.
146	Phoebe	 (rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!
147		Commercial Break
148	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are there.]
149	Monica	 Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.
150	Rachel	 Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!
151	Joey	 You said number two.
152	Rachel	 I also said number one.
153	Joey	 I know. (giggles harder)
154	Ross	 (entering) Hey! Everyone.
155	Rachel	 Hi!
156	Ross	 How’s my little boy?
157	Rachel	 He’s perfect, he’s never been better.
158	Ross	 (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?
159	Ben	 Monica.
160	Ross	 Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.
161	Ben	 Monica bang!
162	Monica	 Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.
163	Phoebe	 Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
164	Joey	 Uh.
165	Phoebe	 What?
166	Joey	 Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
167		[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]
168	Phoebe	 Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
169	Rachel	 Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.
170	Joey	 I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.
171	Monica	 All right, we should call somebody.
172	Ross	 And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.
173	Rachel	 Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.
174	Monica	 How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.
175	Joey	 Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.
176	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.]
177	Joey	 Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
178	Chandler	 Yeah.
179	Joey	 Well, now we got a reason.
180	Chandler	 What?
181	Joey	 Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.
182	Chandler	 All right.
183	Joey	 Hey uh, what’s a matter?
184	Chandler	 I talked to Janice.
185	Joey	 Oh my God, is she going back to him?
186	Chandler	 She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
187	Joey	 What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
188	Chandler	 I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
189	Joey	 Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.
190	Chandler	 Come on, tell me.
191	Joey	 All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.
192	Chandler	 What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?
193	Joey	 They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
194	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is entering from Rachel’s room.]
195	Ross	 Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
196	Rachel	 Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
197	Ross	 It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
198	Rachel	 (confidently) I did!
199	Ross	 I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.
200	Rachel	 I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
201	Ross	 Monica did it?
202		(Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace.)
203	Ross	 Monica?
204	Monica	 Yeah.
205	Ross	 Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
206	Monica	 No. Why?
207	Ross	 Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.
208	Monica	 Really?!
209	Ross	 Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle)
210	Monica	 Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
211	Rachel	 I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.
212	Monica	 (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)
213	Ross	 Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
214	Rachel	 I’ll get the hat.
215	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.]
216	Chandler	 Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.
217	Janice	 Okay.
218	Chandler	 I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
219	Janice	 Wow!
220	Chandler	 Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.
221	Janice	 Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
222	Chandler	 Then don’t leave me!
223	Janice	 What?
224	Chandler	 Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
225	Janice	 No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.
226	Chandler	 No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
227	Janice	 (standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)
228	Chandler	 Ohhh. Don’t go.
229	Janice	 No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’t let her go.)
230	Chandler	 No. No! No! No!
231	Janice	 Honey, honey, people are looking.
232	Chandler	 I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don’t care!!
233	Janice	 Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of Chandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)
234	Chandler	 You can’t leave! I have your shoe!
235	Janice	 Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)
236	Gunther	 Rachel has those in burgendy.
237	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the giant poking device.]
238	Joey	 All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
239	Ross	 Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
240	Phoebe	 I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
241	Joey	 All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
242		(They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs.)
243	Phoebe	 He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!
244	Monica	 And yet, we’re still poking him.
245	Joey	 Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
246	Ross	 He does not look happy.
247	Rachel	 Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.
248	Joey	 Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
249		Closing Credits
250	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is listening to a Lionel Richie album]
251	Chandler	 (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....
252	Phoebe	 (joining him) Love....
253	Chandler and Phoebe	 I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I don’t mind.
254	Chandler	 (high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.
255	Chandler and Phoebe	 Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
256	Chandler	 I know.
257	Phoebe	 I know.
258	Chandler	 I’ve found.
259	Phoebe	 I’ve found....
260	Chandler and Phoebe	 ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless love. (once again they don’t match tones, and they just look at each other)
