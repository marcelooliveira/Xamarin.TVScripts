2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
3	Ross	 Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
4		(A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.)
5	All	 Oooh!
6	Monica	 W-wait. What is that?
7	Ross	 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
8	Monica	 No, no, I don't.
9	Rachel	 Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
10	Ross	 My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
11	Phoebe	 That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
12	Chandler	 Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
13	Monica	 Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
14	Ross	 Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
15	Monica	 Why don't you just get a roommate?
16	Ross	 Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]
19	Phoebe	 So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
20	Chandler	 Might wanna open with the snowman.
21		(Enter Joey)
22	All	 Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
23	Monica	 So, how'd it go?
24	Joey	 Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
25	Ross	 How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
26	Joey	 I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
27	Monica	 So what are you gonna be?
28	Joey	 Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
29	Rachel	 Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
30	Chandler	 Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday
31	Rachel	 Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
32	Phoebe	 Yeah, you wish!
33	Chandler	 It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
34	All	 Yeah, okay. Alright.
35	Chandler	 Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
36	All	 Woooo! Yeah!
37	Rachel	 Phoebe, you're on.
38	Phoebe	 Oh, oh, good.
39	Rachel	 (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
40	Phoebe	 (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung
41		I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? (shakes bell) La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
42		(Cut to later. Everyone is totally depressed by now.)
43	Phoebe	 (Sung)
44		...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...
45		(Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy discussion)
46	Phoebe	 (Sung)
47		...I feel a little sneezy And now I- (abruptly stops)
48		Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
49	Max	 No. No, that's- that's okay.
50	Phoebe	 Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
51	Chandler	 (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
52	David	 Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
53	Phoebe	 Could you speak up please?
54	David	 (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
55	Max	 Daryl Hannah.
56	David	 Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
57	Max	 Hard quality.
58	David	 -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. (Sits down)
59	Phoebe	 Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)
60	Joey	 Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
61	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]
62	Ross	 Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
63	Rachel	 Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
64	Ross	 Just a smidge.
65	Phoebe	 David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
66	Monica	 I think it's romantic.
67	Phoebe	 Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
68	Rachel	 Yeah!
69	Phoebe	 Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
70	Chandler	 Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
71	Phoebe	 No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
72	Chandler	 Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
73	Monica	 What?!
74	Ross	 C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
75	Chandler	 I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
76	Monica	 Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
77	Chandler	 I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
78		[Joey enters, his shoes have bells on, which jingle as he walks. He is wearing a long coat.]
79	Joey	 Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
80		(He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume)
81	Chandler	 Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
82	Joey	 Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
83	Chandler	 Aah, y'killing me!
84		(Marcel knocks over some kitchen tools)
85	Monica	 Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
86	Ross	 Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
87	Monica	 Do you always have to bring him here?
88	Ross	 I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
89	Chandler	 Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
90	Ross	 Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
91	Chandler	 Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
92	[Scene	 Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard.]
93	David	 ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
94	Phoebe	 Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
95	David	 Yuh.
96	Phoebe	 Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
97	David	 Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
98	Phoebe	 Sure.
99	David	 Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
100	Phoebe	 Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
101	David	 Rrrreally.
102	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
103	David	 ...Now? Now?
104	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, right now.
105	David	 Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)
106	Phoebe	 Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
107	David	 Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
108	Phoebe	 I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
109		(They kiss, finally)
110	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there.]
111	Ross	 So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
112	Monica	 I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
113	Chandler	 Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
114	Monica	 Yeah.
115	Joey	 You know more than one Fun Bobby?
116	Chandler	 I happen to know a Fun Bob.
117	Rachel	 (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...
118	Joey	 Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
119	Rachel	 (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
120	Ross	 Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
121	Joey	 Uh, four.
122	Ross	 Four.
123	Rachel	 Five.
124	Ross	 Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
125	Rachel	 Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
126	Joey	 Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
127	Ross	 Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
128	Rachel	 Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
129	Ross	 Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
130	Monica	 What's the matter?
131	Ross	 Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
132	Chandler	 That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
133	Ross	 Really.
134	Chandler	 Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
135	Ross	 What, uh... what juggling thing?
136	Chandler	 With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
137	Ross	 No.
138	Chandler	 Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
139		(Max runs in)
140	Max	 Phoebe. Hi.
141	Phoebe	 Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
142	Max	 No. Have you seen David?
143	Phoebe	 No, no, he hasn't been around.
144	Max	 Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
145	Phoebe	 Minsk?
146	Max	 Minsk. It's in Russia.
147	Phoebe	 I know where Minsk is.
148	Max	 We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
149	Phoebe	 So when, when do you leave?
150	Max	 January first.
151		Commercial Break
152	[Scene	 Max and David's lab, they are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]
153	Phoebe	 Hello?
154	David	 Hey!
155	Phoebe	 Hi.
156	David	 Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
157	Phoebe	 Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!
158	Max	 It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
159	Phoebe	 Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?
160	Max	 Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' (Storms out)
161	David	 Thank you, Max. Thank you.
162	Phoebe	 So-so you're really not going?
163	David	 I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
164	Phoebe	 Oh don't do that.
165	David	 Please.
166	Phoebe	 Oh no no.
167	David	 No, but I'm asking-
168	Phoebe	 Oh, but I can't do that-
169	David	 No, but I can't-
170	Phoebe	 It's your thing, and-
171	David	 -make the decision-
172	Phoebe	 Okay, um, stay.
173	David	 Stay.
174	Phoebe	 Stay.
175		(He thinks for a moment and sweeps the stuff off the table)
176	Phoebe	 Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
177	David	 It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)
178	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the party has started.]
179	Janice	 I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)
180	Chandler	 You remember Janice.
181	Monica	 Vividly.
182		(Someone knocks on the door; Monica gets it)
183	Monica	 Hi.
184	Sandy	 Hi, I'm Sandy.
185	Joey	 Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.
186	Sandy	 Yeah. That's okay, right?
187		(Joey and Monica look at each other and shrug. Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder)
188	Ross	 Par-tay!
189	Monica	 That thing is not coming in here.
190	Ross	 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
191	Monica	 I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
192	Ross	 Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
193	Monica	 Alright. Just keep him away from me.
194	Ross	 Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
195		(The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look)
196	Monica	 Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
197	Rachel	 Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
198	Phoebe	 And then... your face is bloated?
199	Rachel	 No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
200		[Time lapse. Monica and Rachel, fixed up somewhat, emerge from a bedroom]
201	Sandy	 Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
202	Joey	 Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
203	Sandy	 Yeah.
204		(They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them)
205	Joey	 Hey, kids...
206	Ross	 (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
207	Janice	 (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
208	Chandler	 (Imitating) But you found me!
209	Janice	 Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
210	Chandler	 Kill me. Kill me now.
211		(Someone else knocks on the door. Monica looks through the spyhole)
212	Monica	 Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
213		(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)
214	Fun Bobby	 Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
215	Joey	 (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
216		(Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back)
217		[Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in tears]
218	Fun Bobby	 It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
219	Janice	 (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
220	Chandler	 Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
221	Janice	 Oh, no. Oh, no.
222	Chandler	 I'm sorry you misunderstood...
223	Janice	 Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)
224		(Ross is still taking photos)
225	Chandler	 Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
226		(David is feeding Phoebe popcorn. Max walks up)
227	Phoebe	 Hi, Max!
228	Max	 Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
229	David	 Wow.
230	Max	 It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)
231	Phoebe	 Are you alright?
232	David	 Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
233		(Phoebe leads David into a bedroom)
234	Phoebe	 You're going to Minsk.
235	David	 No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
236	Phoebe	 Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
237	David	 Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
238	Phoebe	 Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
239	David	 Uh, ow.
240	Phoebe	 Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
241	David	 I'll never forget you.
242	Phoebe	 And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
243	Dick Clark	 (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
244		(Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids)
245	Joey	 There y'go, kids.
246	Chandler	 (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
247	Joey	 You seen Sandy?
248	Chandler	 Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
249	Rachel	 Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
250	All	 (in the kitchen) What?
251	Rachel	 The bll is drrbing!
252	Dick Clark	 (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
253	Chandler	 And the moment of joy is upon us.
254	Joey	 Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
255	Phoebe	 Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
256	Monica	 Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
257		(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party except for the gang cheers and kisses)
258	Chandler	 Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
259	Phoebe	 I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
260	Rachel	 I can't kiss anyone.
261	Monica	 So I'm kissing everyone?
262	Joey	 Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
263	Ross	 Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
264	Chandler	 Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
265	Joey	 Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
266		Closing Credits
267	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]
268	Ross	 (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
269	Rachel	 ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
