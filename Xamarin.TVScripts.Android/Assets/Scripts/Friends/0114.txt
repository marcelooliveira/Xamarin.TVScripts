2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it.]
3	Joey	 I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
4	Ross	 She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
5	Chandler	 Any contact?
6	Ross	 She lent me an egg once.
7	Joey	 You're in!
8	Ross	 Aw, right.
9	Woman	 Hi, Ross.
10	Ross	 Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
11	Chandler	 Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
12	Joey	 Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
13	Ross	 An egg?
14	Joey	 Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
15	Chandler	 I think it's winning.
16	Ross	 I think it's insane.
17	Chandler	 She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
18		(Ross walks over to the woman, egg in hand.)
19	Joey	 Think it'll work?
20	Chandler	 No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
21	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler are there. Ross is still talking to the beautiful woman.]
22	Monica	 You can not do this.
23	Rachel	 Do what, do what?
24	Monica	 Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
25	Rachel	 No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
26	Phoebe	 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
27	Monica	 But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
28	Rachel	 Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
29	Joey	 Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
30	Chandler	 Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
31	Joey	 No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
32	Chandler	 Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
33	Joey	 Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
34	Ross	 Hi. She said yes.
35	Chandler	 Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
36	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up.]
37	Joey	 (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
38	Chandler	 Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
39	Lorraine	 Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
40	Chandler	 ...And what did you bring?
41	Lorraine	 She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
42	Chandler	 Janice?
43		(Lorraine leaves. Joey shakes his head as though to say, 'It can't be the same Janice.' Janice enters.)
44	Janice	 Oh.... my.... God.
45	Chandler	 (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
46	[Scene	 The bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking.]
47	Chandler	 Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
48	Joey	 No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
49	Chandler	 Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
50	Joey	 (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
51	Chandler	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
52	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with men.]
53	Rachel	 Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
54	Monica	 Which one was Pete Carney?
55	Rachel	 Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"
56	Monica	 Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.
57	Rachel	 How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
58	Monica	 I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
59	Phoebe	 I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
60	Monica	 There's more beer, right?
61	Phoebe	 Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
62	Rachel	 Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
63	Phoebe	 Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
64	Monica	 Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
65	Phoebe	 Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
66	Rachel	 Or?
67	Phoebe	 Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
68	Monica	 Burning's good.
69	Rachel	 Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
70	[Scene	 The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one another.]
71	Lorraine	 You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
72	Joey	 Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
73	Janice	 By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
74	Chandler	 That's OK.
75	Janice	 Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
76		(Lorraine whispers into Joey's ear.)
77	Joey	 (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
78	Chandler	 (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
79	Joey	 Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
80		(Chandler and Joey leave the table.)
81	Joey	 Uh, we might be leaving now.
82	Chandler	 Tell me it's "you and me" we.
83	Joey	 She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
84	Chandler	 Ok, you can not do this to me.
85	Joey	 You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
86	Lorraine	 (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
87	Joey	 I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
88	Chandler	 I hope she throws up on you.
89		(Joey leaves with Lorraine. Chandler sits back down with Janice.)
90	Chandler	 So...
91	Janice	 Just us.
92	Chandler	 Oh, what a crappy night!
93	Janice	 Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
94	Chandler	 Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
95	Janice	 So, do we have the best friends or what?
96	Chandler	 Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
97	Janice	 I will go for that drink.
98	Chandler	 You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
99	Janice	 Each.
100	Chandler	 That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
101	[Scene	 Chandler's bedroom, Chandler wakes up, and finds someone else's hand on his chest. He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there.]
102	Janice	 Happy Valentine's Day!
103	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment.]
104	Janice	 Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
105	Chandler	 No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
106	Janice	 Kiss me!
107		(Janice kisses him. Monica comes out for the newspaper.}
108	Monica	 Oh, Chandler, sorry.
109		(Janice turns around, Monica sees who it is.)
110	Monica	 Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
111	Janice	 Hi, Monica.
112	Chandler	 Ok, well, this was very special.
113	Monica	 Rach, come see who's out here!
114		(Rachel comes out.)
115	Rachel	 Oh my god. Janice, hi!
116	Chandler	 Janice is gonna go away now.
117	Monica	 I'll be right back.
118		(Joey enters from the stairs.)
119	Rachel	 Oh, Joey, look who it is.
120	Joey	 (in disbelief) Whoa.
121	Chandler	 Oh, good, Joey's home now.
122	Janice	 This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
123		(Monica comes out with her cordless phone.)
124	Monica	 Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.
125	Janice	 Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously)
126	[Scene	 A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.]
127	Ross	 I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
128		(Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like 'Why did I just say that?' Ross' ex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.)
129	Kristin	 That's funny. Who are they?
130	Ross	 The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
131	Kristin	 You mean they're lovers.
132	Ross	 If you wanna put a label on it.
133	Kristin	 Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
134	Ross	 Nope, nope, that's it.
135		(Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.)
136	Ross	 Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!
137	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.]
138	Phoebe	 Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
139	Monica	 All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
140	Phoebe	 Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
141	Rachel	 Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
142	Monica	 Can we just start throwing things in?
143	Phoebe	 Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.
144	Rachel	 (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
145	Phoebe	 Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
146	Monica	 Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
147	Rachel	 (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
148	Monica	 No.
149	Rachel and Phoebe	 Eww!
150	Rachel	 And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
151	Monica	 Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
152		(Rachel throws the alcohol in the fire. A burst of flames shoots up from it.)
153	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice again.]
154	Chandler	 How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
155	Joey	 I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
156	Chandler	 Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
157		(Janice enters.)
158	Janice	 Hello, funny Valentine.
159	Chandler	 Hi, Just Janice.
160	Janice	 Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
161		(Janice kisses Joey all over. Chandler smiles.)
162	Joey	 (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
163	[Scene	 The Chinese Restaurant.]
164	Ross	 So, um, what do you do for a living?
165	Kristin	 Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
166	Carol	 Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
167	Susan	 I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. (Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)
168	Ross	 Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
169	Kristin	 (reluctantly) I guess.
170	Ross	 Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
171	Carol	 Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
172	Ross	 Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
173	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of control.]
174	Fireman No. 1	 What do we got there?
175	Fireman No. 2	 A piece of something
176	Monica	 You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
177	Fireman No. 3	 It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
178	Fireman No. 1	 You're our third call tonight.
179	Rachel	 Really?
180	Fireman No. 2	 Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
181	[Scene	 Central Perk.]
182	Janice	 I brought you something.
183	Chandler	 Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
184	Janice	 I had them made special.
185	Chandler	 Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
186	Janice	 That's fine.
187	Chandler	 (surprised) It is?
188	Janice	 Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
189	Chandler	 Oh no, you see, actually it is.
190	Janice	 No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
191	Chandler	 Oh, no I don't.
192	Janice	 Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
193	Chandler	 I did, but...
194	Janice	 You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
195		(She kisses him passionately,then leaves.)
196	Chandler	 Call me!
197	[Scene	 The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.]
198	Carol	 It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
199	Ross	 You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?
200	Carol	 Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
201	Ross	 Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
202	Carol	 That could be it.
203	Ross	 Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)
204	Carol	 Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
205	Ross	 No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
206		(They kiss.)
207	Carol	 Oh, I love you too. But...
208	Ross	 No but, no but.
209	Carol	 You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
210	Ross	 That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
211	Carol	 All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
212		(A beautiful woman walks by Ross, he stares at her.)
213	Carol	 Not her.
214	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, The girls are talking with the firemen.]
215	Fireman No. 3	 We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
216	Rachel	 So, um, will you bring the truck?
217	Fireman No. 3	 I'll even let you ring the bell.
218	Rachel	 Oh, my god.
219	Phoebe	 See, there you go, the cleansing works!
220	Monica	 They're nice guys.
221	Rachel	 Oh, they're firemen guys.
222	[Scene	 Out in the hall, the firemen are talking.]
223	Fireman No. 1	 You guys tell them you were married?
224	Fireman No. 2	 No way!
225	Fireman No. 3	 Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
226		End
