13	Chandler	 What�s up, Joe?
14		[Joey�s apartment. Conversation switches between the two scenes when each person speaks]
15	Joey	 Okay. What have we wanted to always do together?

17	Joey	 No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are gonna be at the Wizards � Knicks game courtside!
18	Chandler	 Courtside? Oh my god!!

21		[Monica�s apartment. Phone rings]
22	Monica	 Hello?
23		[Chandler�s office, Tulsa � Conversation switches between the two scenes when the people are talking]
24	Chandler	 Joey just called. He�s got courtside Knicks tickets for me and him tomorrow night.
25	Monica	 Really? But tomorrow night�s the only one I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game then we won�t have another night together for a week.
26	Chandler	 But-t it�s courtside! The cheerleaders are gonna be right in � [mouths last words so Monica does not hear them]. That�s not the way to convince you.
27	Monica	 Look. I don�t want to be one of those wives that says �You can�t go to the game�, �you have to spend time with me�, so, if you just realize it on your own?
28	Chandler	 I�I�I know. You�re right. I wanna see you too. I�ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey. He�s really looking forward to this.
29	Monica	 [On phone] Tell him you haven�t seen your wife in a long time. [In apartment] Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that�what little time that we have is precious.
30	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I�ll think of something.

46	Ross	 Yeah.
47	Rachel	 I didn�t know that you guys hung out.
48	Ross	 We don�t. But, I thought that it would be nice to get to know him. You know? We have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
49	Rachel	 Awww. That�s so cute! Ross and Mike�s first date! [Beat] Is that going to be awkward? What are you guys gonna talk about?
50	Ross	 Well, but, you know, we have a lot in common, you know, erm�he plays the piano, I played keyboards in college, or, he�s been divorced, I have�some�experience in that area

79		[Long, awkward silence]
80	Ross	 Erm, you know, I�m divorced. Er, Phoebe said you�ve been divorced.
81	Mike	 Yeah. [Beat] I�m sorry. I don�t really like to talk about it.Ross
82		[They take another swig of beer]
83	Mike	 So, you�re a palaeontologist, right?
84	Ross	 Yeah.
85	Mike	 My cousin�s a palaeontologist.
86	Ross	 Ah!
87		[Silence]
88	Ross	 Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
89	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler�s apartment. Monica has a bottle of red wine on the table, along with two filled glasses. Chandler bursts through the door quickly, pulling his suitcase along with him]
90	Monica	 Hi! [Surprised]
91	Chandler	 Hey!
92	Monica	 Welcome home.
93	Chandler	 Oh, well, look at you!
94		[Chandler closes and locks the door]
95	Monica	 What do you think?
96	Chandler	 Well, it�s great, well, I�m just wearing the same thing underneath! Look at you.
97		[Monica and Chandler hug and kiss. Loud bang outside]
98	Joey	 Ooh. Hey, how come you door�s locked?
99	Monica	 Just a second.
100	Chandler	 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Joey can�t know that I am here.
101	Monica	 Why not?
102	Chandler	 Because I didn�t know how to tell him that I couldn�t go to the Knicks game, so I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
103	Monica	 So you lied to him?
104	Chandler	 Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!
105		[Rattling of the doorknob]
106	Joey	 Hey! Open the door! What�s going on?
107		[Knock. Monica opens the door slightly. Chandler sneaks behind it]
108	Monica	 Hi!
109	Joey	 Why are you dressed like that?
110	Monica	 [Nervous giggle] Because I, erm, well, Chandler�s gonna be home in a couple of days, so I thought that I would just, er, practice the art of seduction.
111	Joey	 I thought I heard a man�s voice before?
112	Monica	 I was just doing Chandler�s side of the conversation, y�know like �Hi�, �How do I look� [In Chandler�s voice] �Really sexy�, �Could I be any more turned on?�
113		[Chandler slaps Monica on the shoulder. Monica slaps him back. It hurts Chandler]
114	Joey	 Woah, woah, woah. Why are there two glasses of wine out?
115	Monica	 Because, one of them is for you! [Monica goes to get a glass. Chandler looks at Joey through the peep-hole and Chandler ducks. Monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. Gives one to Joey. �Clinks� the glasses together] Okay, bye, bye!
116		[Shuts door]
117	Chandler	 You know, it�s funny. I�ve been practising the art of seduction as well! Hya! [Does a wiggle]
118	Monica	 You might wanna keep practising.
119	Chandler	 Yeah. [Chandler�s phone goes off] It�s Joey.
120	Monica	 What?
121		[Chandler presses a button on the phone and puts the phone up to his ear to listen. Monica puts her ear by it too.]
122	Chandler	 Hey, Joe!
123		[Joey�s apartment. Scenes change when the different people speak]
124	Joey	 Dude, come home!
125	Chandler	 What? Why?
126	Joey	 Come home!
127	Chandler	 Look, I can�t. What�s going on?
128	Joey	 I don�t know how to tell you this, but I think that Monica�s cheating on ya! I told you that you shouldn�t have married someone much hotter than you! [Chandler looks at Monica. They nod then put their ears back to the phone. Joey walks out of his apartment and up to Monica�s door] Right, look. If you can�t come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna�
129	Chandler	 [Loudly] No!
130	Joey	 I just heard him!
131	Chandler	 [Quiet] Can you hear him now?
132	Joey	 No. Right, I�m going in!
133	Chandler	 [Loudly] No! Wait!
134	Joey	 I heard him again!
135		[Chandler starts to freak out on the spot]
136	Chandler	 Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.
137	Joey	 Great. I�ll see you when you get here. I�m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
138	Chandler	 Is that really necessary?
139	Joey	 Absolutely. You�d do it for me! Not that you�d ever have to, �cos I know how to keep my women completely satisfied.
140	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s apartment. Both Ross and Mike are sat on the sofa, with Fosters in their hands. Mike is blowing across the top of his bottle]
141	Ross	 Shouldn�t the pizza be here by now? They said 30 minutes or less. How long has it been?
142	Mike	 [Looks at watch] Eleven minutes. [Still looking at watch] And now twelve. [Picks up bottle] Do you like the beer?
143	Ross	 I do. I do. Although it is actually a lager.
144	Mike	 Oh. What�s the difference between a beer and a lager?
145	Ross	 I don�t know. We can look it up.
146	Mike	 Things are about to get wild!
147	[Scene	 A bar. Phoebe and Rachel are carrying drinks]
148	Phoebe	 Oh, god. Do you remember the girls� nights that we used to have? Sitting around, talking about you and Ross?
149	Rachel	 Oh, god. It seems like forever ago.
150	Phoebe	 I know.
151		[Both sit down]
152	Phoebe	 So what�s going on with you and Ross?
153	Rachel	 Well, um, I don�t know. I mean, for a long time, nothing. You know, actually, right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a little thing.
154	Phoebe	 Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?
155	Rachel	 Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact.
156	Phoebe	 Eye contact?
157	Rachel	 Uh huh.
158	Phoebe	 I hope you were using protection.
159		[A waiter comes over with two drinks on his tray. He places them on the table]
160	Waiter	 Excuse me, um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
161		[The waiter leaves. Phoebe and Rachel look to see who it is]
162	Phoebe	 Should we send them something back? Yes, let�s do! Let�s send them mashed potatoes!!
163	Rachel	 No, wait, don�t do that! It�s gonna make them think that they can come over here!
164	Phoebe	 So, what if they do?
165	Rachel	 We�re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a�baby and a Ross.
166	Phoebe	 Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not everything has to go as far as �eye contact�.
167	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler�s apartment]
168	Monica	 Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.
169	Chandler	 Don�t you think it�s better for him to think that you�re cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!
170	Monica	 I don�t want him to think that I'm having an affair.
171	Chandler	 Alright. I�ve got a plan. I�ll go down the fire escape�
172	Monica	 Yes. Because all good plans start with �I�ll just go down the fire escape��
173	Chandler	 Hear me out, woman! I�ll go down the fire escape, then I�ll wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, it�ll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here.
174	Monica	 Aren�t you afraid that Joey�s going to figure all this out? [Silence] I heard it!
175		[Chandler goes to the window, opens it, looks out, then comes back in]
176	Chandler	 Just gonna wait for a little while.
177	Monica	 Scary pigeon�s back?
178	Chandler	 It�s huge!
179	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s apartment. There is a nearly-empty pizza box on the table. Mike and Ross have swapped positions on the couch. Mike still has a bottle of Foster�s in his hand. He is making funny noises. Ross looks bored. Mike stops making the noise, looks at Ross, looks back at the bottle and continues to make the noise. Ross looks exasperated]
180	[Scene	 Bar. Phoebe and Rachel are talking to the two men that sent the drinks over to them]
181	Rachel	 Oh my god! I can�t believe you live in that building! My grandmother lives in that building, Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kinda smells of chicken? Looks like a potato?!?
182	Bill	 Spuds is your grandmother?
183	Rachel	 Yeah! That�s my muppy!
184	Kevin	 So, we�re on our way to a couple of parties. Maybe we can get your numbers and give you a call when we find something fun.
185	Phoebe	 Yeah, I�m sorry. We weren�t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I-I have a boyfriend.
186	Kevin	 Alright. That�s no big deal.
187		[Kevin and Bill get up]
188	Bill	 So, she has a boyfriend. [To Rachel] What is your situation?
189	Rachel	 Oh, it�s complicated. I don�t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm�
190	Bill	 Can I have your number?
191	Rachel	 I�m sorry, no.
192	Bill	 Okay [They start to leave]
193	Rachel	 Oh, sure!
194		[Reaches into her handbag]
195	Phoebe	 Oh my god! You�re giving your real number!
196	Bill	 Okay, thanks. I�ll give you a call later tonight.
197	Rachel	 Great. [Gives thumbs up]
198	Bill	 Bye [Leaves]
199	Rachel, Phoebe	 Bye
200	Phoebe	 Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
201	Rachel	 I don�t know. He was cute and he liked me. It was an impulse.
202	Phoebe	 But what about Ross? What about your moment? Don�t you want to talk to Ross about it?
203	Rachel	 No, no, �cos I know exactly how the conversation is going to go. �Hey Ross�, �You know, I think that we had a moment before� [As Ross] �Yeah, um, me too� [As herself] �Well, but I�m not sure I really wanna do anything about it!� [As Ross] �Yeah, um, me, um, neither.� [As herself] �Ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we�re really feeling?� [As Ross] �Yeah, that works for me, um, um.�
204	Phoebe	 Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your Rachel was not whiney enough.
205	Rachel	 Hey!
206	Phoebe	 Better!
207		[Phoebe reaches for her drink]
208	Rachel	 The point is
209	Phoebe	 So, really? Are you moving on from Ross?
210	Rachel	 Dunno, do I have to decide right now?
211	Phoebe	 You kinda just did. That guy�s gonna call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone. That�s a pretty clear message.
212	Rachel	 Oh my god! Ross!! Ross is gonna pick up the phone! Ah, I have to get my number back! Oh my god! He�s gone!
213	Phoebe	 [As Rachel] �Ah, I have to get my number back!�, �Oh my god! He�s gone!� Dead on!
214	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s apartment. Ross and Mile look bored out of their heads]
215	Mike	 Passst. I�m gonna take off.
216	Ross	 So soon?
217	Mike	 Yeah.
218	Ross	 Okay. Thanks, er, for the beer.
219	Mike	 You mean lager.
220	Ross	 Ah, yeah, good times.
221		[Ross opens door. Mike steps out through door. Ross closes door]
222	Mike	 Ohh. [Relieved to be out of there]
223	Ross	 Ohh. [Relieved that Mike has gone]
224		[Mike�s mobile phone rings]
225	Mike	 Hello?
226		[Bar. Phoebe is on the other end of the phone. Scenes switch with the conversation]
227	Phoebe	 Hey Mike, it�s me. Listen
228	Mike	 Uh no, I just left.
229	Phoebe	 Well, you have to go back in.
230	Mike	 What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?
231	Phoebe	 I�m so sorry, honey, but, okay. Rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want Ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls.
232	Mike	 I can�t do that.
233	Phoebe	 [To Rachel] He says that he can�t do that
234	Rachel	 Oh, give me. [Rachel takes the phone of Phoebe] Hi, Mike! Hi, listen, I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. If you do this, ah, Phoebe will do anything you want. Seriously, I�m talking dirty stuff.
235	Phoebe	 Alright, give it here. [Phoebe takes the phone] Hello? I'm sorry about her, but, she wasn�t wrong about the dirty stuff.
236	Mike	 Alright, I�ll do it. [Phoebe sticks her thumb up to Rachel] Really, though, how much dirtier can it get?
237	Phoebe	 Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]
238	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s apartment. Knock at the door. Ross opens the door. Mike is there.]
239	Mike	 Hey, buddy!
240	Ross	 Hi!
241	Mike	 Can I come back in?
242	Ross	 W-Why? [Blocking route of entry]
243	Mike	 Well, [negotiating an entrance] I was just thinking of how muck more we have to talk about.
244	Ross	 [Exasperated] But, you left!
245	[Scene	 Hallway between Monica/Chandler�s apartment and Joey�s apartment. Joey is sat on a stool, holding a baseball bat. Chandler runs up the stairs]
246	Joey	 Wow, that didn�t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight?
247	Chandler	 Well,� you�re forgetting about the time difference.
248		[Joey looks puzzled for a second, then smiles and points at Chandler. Chandler smiles and points back. Chandler opens the door to his apartment and enters. Joey follows.]
249	Monica	 Huh, Chandler � you�re home!
250	Chandler	 That�s right. Your husband�s home, so now the sex can stop.
251		[Monica looks stunned]
252	Monica	 What are you saying?
253	Chandler	 Joey said that you�re in here with another man!
254	Monica	 There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps Chandler]
255	Joey	 Alright, alright. Then maybe you won�t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at?
256		[Joey goes into Monica and Chandler�s bedroom. Banging can be heard]
257	Chandler	 What�s he doing?
258	Monica	 I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!
259		[Both laugh. Joey enters]
260	Joey	 Bedroom�s clear, although you might need some new pillows.
261	Chandler	 Alright, well, I�ll check the guest bedroom.
262		[Chandler heads off to guest bedroom. Joey walks up to Monica and starts sniffing loudly and heavily]
263	Joey	 Why do I smell men�s cologne?
264		[Monica smells Joey]
265	Monica	 I think that's you.
266		[Joey smells himself]
267	Joey	 Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
268		[Chandler re-enters]
269	Chandler	 Nobody here, Joe.
270	Joey	 I guess not.
271	Monica	 I can�t believe you thought I was cheating. You owe me an apology.
272	Joey	 You�re right, Monica. I�m so sorry.
273	Monica	 It�s an honest mistake. It can happen to anybody. Alright, see ya.
274		[Monica pushes Joey towards the door. Joey sees Chandler�s cases]
275	Joey	 Wait, wait, wait a minute. If you�ve just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
276		[Chandler looks at Monica]
277	Chandler	 I climb down the fire escape, and you can�t put that in the closet?
278		[Joey looks shocked]
279	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s apartment. Ross and Mike are sat on the sofa. Mike is reading out of a book]
280	Mike	 So, with the exception of the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating, isn�t it?
281	Ross	 [Looking bored] Maybe you should look up fascinating.
282		[Phone rings]
283	Mike	 I�ll get it [Jumps across Ross and grabs the phone. Ross looks shocked] Hello? Ross� place, Mike speaking. [Passing phone to Ross] It�s for you.
284		[Ross takes phone]
285	Ross	 I don�t understand what just happened here.
286	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler�s apartment. As before]
287	Joey	 What�s going on?
288	Chandler	 I�m sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didn�t�didn�t know�didn�t think you�d understand.
289	Joey	 What? You think I�m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? Uh? You think I�m like, duhhh! [Taps head with baseball bat � it hurts him]
290	Monica	 Joey?
291	Joey	 Yeah?
292	Monica	 I don�t know what to say. We shouldn�t have lied to you.
293	Chandler	 I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
294	Joey	 You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldn�t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
295	Chandler	 I�m sorry. That�s the one thing I can�t do. I promised that I�d be with Monica.
296	Joey	 [Looking sad] Alright.
297	Monica	 You can go.
298	Chandler	 [Turning around] What?
299	Monica	 You should go to the game. It�s okay, I want you to.
300	Chandler	 Really? Are you going to be okay?
301	Monica	 Yeah, it�ll be fine. Y�know, maybe I�ll stay and practice the art of seduction.
302	Chandler	 You�re gonna put sweats on and clean, aren�t ya?
303	Monica	 That�s gonna be so hot!
304		[Monica and Chandler hug]
