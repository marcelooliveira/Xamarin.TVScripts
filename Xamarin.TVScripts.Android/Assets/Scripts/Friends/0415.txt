2	[Scene	 A beauty parlour, Rachel is getting a manicure while Chandler, yes Chandler, is getting a petticure (Does that scare you that I know those terms? Well, it scares me.).]
3	Chandler	 Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
4	Rachel	 Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
5	Chandler	 That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
6	Rachel	 Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
7	Chandler	 Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
8	Rachel	 Hmm.
9	Woman	 OH…MY…GAWD!! (Yep, you guessed it. It’s Janice.)
10		Opening Credits
11	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Joey are standing at the counter. Monica is flipping a light switch on and off next to the door.]
12	Monica	 Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
13	Joey	 Ohh, Nothing.
14	Monica	 Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
15	Joey	 I know what it did! Nothing.
16	Monica	 They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?
17	Joey	 Like this. (Shrugs)
18	Rachel	 Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
19	Joey	 Sure! It flushes it.
20	Rachel	 Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
21	Chandler	 (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!
22	Joey	 Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
23	Rachel	 Guess who we ran into today?!
24	Monica	 Janice?!
25	Chandler	 Isn’t this amazing?
26	Monica	 How have you been?
27	Janice	 Oh well, I’m divorced.
28	Phoebe	 Ohhh, wow.
29	Janice	 Yeah, I’m riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)
30	Joey	 And there it is.
31	Janice	 I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! (to Chandler) And you, sweetie, I’ll see you tonight.
32	Chandler	 Okay. Bye.
33	Janice	 Bye.
34	Chandler	 Bye.
35	Janice	 Bye.
36	Chandler	 Bye.
37	Janice	 Bye.
38	Chandler	 B-bye!
39	Janice	 Bye-bye.
40	Chandler	 Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
41	Phoebe	 What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
42	Chandler	 Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!
43	Joey	 So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!
44	Chandler	 Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
45	Rachel	 You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
46	Chandler	 (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)
47	Joey	 Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!
48	[Scene	 A street, Ross and Emily are walking home from a date.]
49	Emily	 I can’t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
50	Ross	 No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
51		(At that moment two very large men start screaming and running towards Emily and picking her up.)
52	Ross	 Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
53	Emily	 No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
54	Devon	 Hey, mate.
55	Liam	 How are ya man?
56	Ross	 Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!
57	Emily	 So how are you? I’ve been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I’ve been rather busy.
58	Devon	 Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
59	Emily	 Oh my God. I think you’re right.
60	Liam	 (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
61	Emily	 Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)
62	Ross	 Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it (In an English accent) football?
63	Devon	 We were playing rugby.
64	Liam	 In fact we’re playing a game at the park tomorrow. You’re welcome to play too if you want.
65	Emily	 (laughs) Ross play rugby? I don’t think so.
66	Ross	 What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?
67	Emily	 Well I mean, you’re American to start with. You don’t even have rugby here.
68	Ross	 Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…
69	Devon	 So good then! We’ll see you at Riverside Park at 2
70	Liam	 Cheers!
71	Ross	 Cheers!
72		(Liam and Devon both take a swig of their beers, while Ross takes a swig of his coffee. The Brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, Ross crushes his coffee cup, spilling its contents.)
73	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is attempting his pre-emptive strike.]
74	Janice	 Oh boy, I just love to sing!
75	Chandler	 Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
76	Janice	 Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)
77	Chandler	 (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
78	Janice	 I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
79	Chandler	 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
80	Janice	 Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
81	Chandler	 I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
82	Janice	 Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?
83	Chandler	 No! No! Not, Paris.
84	Janice	Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
85	Chandler	 Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!
86	Janice	 When?
87	Chandler	 I don’t know exactly.
88	Janice	 Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
89	Chandler	 But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
90	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are plugging in a bunch of electronics.]
91	Monica	 Done?
92	Phoebe	 Yep!
93	Rachel	 (entering, with Joey) Hey!
94	Joey	 Hey! What’s up?
95	Monica	 This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
96	Joey	 (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
97	Rachel	 Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
98	Monica	 Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)
99	Rachel	 It’s coming from Joey!
100	Phoebe	 Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!
101	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are watching rugby on TV as Phoebe enters.]
102	Phoebe	 Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
103	Ross	 Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.
104	Joey	 Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
105	Janice	 (entering) Hey there Ross!
106	Ross	 (shocked) Hey!
107	Phoebe	 (whispering to Ross) Janice.
108	Chandler	 Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.
109	Janice	 Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?
110	Chandler	 Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
111	Joey	 Hey-hey, what’s going on?
112	Chandler	 Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.
113	Joey	 Thanks for telling me!
114		(Janice runs into the bedroom.)
115	Chandler	 I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.
116	Joey	 Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
117	Janice	 (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, I’m gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It’s a real space saver.
118	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.
119	Janice	 Okay, Chandler, come on!
120	Chandler	 (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!
121	Joey	 Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
122	Ross	 Hey, I can handle it! All right?
123	Rachel	 Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
124	Ross	 That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
125	Joey	 (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.
126	Ross	 And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
127	Joey	 Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!
128	Phoebe	 Well, why are you doing this anyway?
129	Ross	 Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.
130	Phoebe	 You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
131	Ross	 Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!
132	Rachel	 (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.
133	Joey	 All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!
134	Chandler	 (from his bedroom) Thanks!
135	Ross	 Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
136	All	 Oh!
137	Rachel	 Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
138		(Ross turns and wants to attack Rachel, but Joey stops him.)
139		Commercial Break
140	[Scene	 The park, everyone is warming up for the rugby game. Only Joey and Phoebe came to support Ross.]
141	Joey	 Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!
142	Ross	 They don’t look any bigger than me!
143	Joey	 Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
144	Emily	 I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
145	Ross	 All right.
146	Emily	 Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.)
147		(A player comes over and picks up a ball in front of Phoebe.)
148	Phoebe	 (to the player) Hi.
149		(The player stands up and smiles. Showing that he has no front teeth.)
150	Phoebe	 Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
151		(The referee blows the whistle and the players gather to start the game.)
152	Ross	 Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!
153	Joey	 I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.
154	Ross	 Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
155	Joey	 No.
156	Ross	 You’ll see.
157		[Cut to Emily, Devon, and Liam]
158	Emily	 Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it’s his first time.
159	Liam	 You don’t say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and spikes it in his face.)
160	Emily	 (to Ross) Good luck, babe.
161		(The scrum forms and the game is underway.)
162	Liam	 Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!
163		(Ross walks over to the scrum, walks around a bit looking for a way to get into the scrum.)
164	Liam	 Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
165		(Ross, urged on by his team-mates, jumps on top of the scrum and falls headfirst into the middle, leaving his feet sticking straight up.)
166	Ross	 JOEY!!!!!!
167	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel’s, Monica is going over some plans as Rachel enters.]
168	Rachel	 You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
169	Monica	 He asked you out?!
170	Rachel	 No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
171	Monica	 Saucy!
172	Rachel	 (refers to the table) What are these?
173	Monica	 Electrical plans for the building.
174	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
175	Monica	 I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
176	Rachel	 Wow! If only more people knew.
177	[Scene	 The airport, the Yemen Express counter, Chandler is still trying to get rid of Janice.]
178	Chandler	 Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.
179	Janice	 Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.
180	Chandler	 Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
181	Janice	 On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.
182	Chandler	 Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
183	Ticket Counter Attendant	 One ticket to Yemen?
184	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
185	Ticket Counter Attendant	 I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand.
186	Chandler	 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
187	Ticket Counter Attendant	 Are you travelling with a child?
188	Chandler	 No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.
189	Ticket Counter Attendant	 Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’t take library cards.
190	Janice	 What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
191	Chandler	 (to the ticket agent) American Express?
192	[Scene	 The rugby game, Ross is getting killed.]
193	Emily	 I can’t believe they’re doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
194	Phoebe	 No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…
195		(The whistle blows.)
196	Emily	 That’s just halftime, there’s more of this.
197		(Ross limps over all covered in mud.)
198	Ross	 Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
199	Emily	 Right.
200	Ross	 (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
201	Emily	 Okay.
202	Ross	 Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
203	Phoebe	 Oh, poor baby.
204	Ross	 (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
205	Emily	 Ross, they are killing you out there!
206	Ross	 (whines "No.") That’s not true!
207	Phoebe	 She’s right! You have to stop!
208	Ross	 What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
209	Joey	 Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!
210	Ross	 I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
211	Emily	 All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
212	Ross	 No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
213	Emily	 No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
214	Ross	 I like that.
215	Emily	 Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
216	Ross	 Huh?
217	Emily	 One swift kick and he’ll back off.
218	Ross	 All right, bad ankle, got it!
219	Emily	 And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup.
220	Ross	 Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
221	Emily	 And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees. You hit him right and he’ll go down like a lamp.
222	Ross	 But-but, Liam’s on my team.
223	Emily	 I don’t care! You just get him!
224	Ross	 I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)
225	Joey	 The Red Ross! Okay.
226	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel’s, Monica is reading a book as Rachel returns.]
227	Rachel	 Hey!
228	Monica	 Hi!
229	Rachel	 (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?
230	Monica	 Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?
231		(Rachel rips one of the wall and finds a huge hole underneath.)
232	Monica	 No-no-no, no!
233		(Rachel rips off another one, revealing another hole. Rachel then moves onto a third one, but this one doesn’t have a hole underneath it.)
234	Monica	 I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
235		(Rachel looks at it and then throws it away. She then removes a fourth one, revealing a third hole.)
236	Rachel	 Oh my God! Look at this!
237	Monica	 Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
238	Rachel	 I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
239	Monica	 I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
240	Rachel	 And did you?!
241	Monica	 No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
242		(Rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.)
243	Monica	 But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
244	Rachel	 Oh my God.
245	Mrs. Chatracus	 Hello darling.
246	Rachel	 Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
247	[Scene	 Central Perk, They are returning from the rugby game, Joey and Emily are carrying Ross.]
248	Phoebe	 Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?
249	Ross	 Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.
250	Joey	 Yeah, sure.
251	Ross	 No, not you. (Emily gets it.)
252	Joey	 Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.
253	Phoebe	 Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)
254	Emily	 You were amazing out there.
255	Ross	 Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?
256	Emily	 Oh my God!
257	Ross	 I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.
258	Emily	 You really enjoyed yourself didn’t you?
259	Ross	 Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
260	Emily	 I think you’ve got concussion.
261	Ross	 No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.
262	Emily	 You’re welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) I’m sorry. Did I hurt you?
263	Ross	 It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.
264	[Scene	 The airport, the flight to Yemen is being called.]
265	Ticket Counter Attendant	 (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
266	Chandler	 Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
267	Janice	 Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?
268	Chandler	 Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
269	Janice	 Oh. Well, I’ll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
270	Chandler	 Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
271		(He gives the agent his ticket and walks onto the jetway. Janice walks over and looks out the window. Chandler walks back into the terminal and tries to walk right past Janice, but she sees him.)
272	Janice	 Chandler?
273	Chandler	 No!
274	Janice	 Chandler!
275	Chandler	 Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
276	Janice	 No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
277	Chandler	 Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
278		Closing Credits
279	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel’s, Monica has finally given up on her search to find what the light switch does and is now flicking it on and off aimlessly.]
280	Monica	 All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
281	Rachel	 Thank God.
282	Monica	 I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
283		[Cut to Chandler and Joey’s, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. The TV is turning off and on, and each time Phoebe is blinking her eyes like the Genie did. The switch obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.]
284	Phoebe	 See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.
285		End
