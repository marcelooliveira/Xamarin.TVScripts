2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry.]
3	Rachel	 Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
4	Terry	 An advance?
5	Rachel	 It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
6	Terry	 Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
7	Rachel	 Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.
8	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.]
9	Rachel	 Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
10	Guy	 Huh?
11	Rachel	 Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.
12		(Monica enters.)
13	Monica	 Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
14	Ross	 No, they're not.
15	Monica	 Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
16	Ross	 You're wrong.
17	Monica	 I am not wrong.
18	Ross	 You're wrong.
19	Monica	 No, I just talked to them.
20	Ross	 (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
21		(Joey enters. His face looks abnormally colorful.)
22	Joey	 Hey, hey.
23	Chandler	 Hey.
24	Phoebe	 Hey.
25	Chandler	 And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
26	Joey	 Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
27	Chandler	 That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
28	Phoebe	 What were you modeling for?
29	Joey	 You know those posters for the city free clinic?
30	Monica	 Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
31	Phoebe	 You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
32	Chandler	 Do you know which one you're gonna be?
33	Joey	 No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)
34	Chandler	 Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
35	Joey	 Thanks.
36		(Ross comes back to the couch.)
37	Ross	 (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
38	Monica	 Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
39	Ross	 Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
40	Monica	 You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
41	Joey	 Yeah.
42	Monica	 And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
43	Chandler	 Yes, every single one of them.
44	Monica	 Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
45	Phoebe	 Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
46	Monica	 So you're free Thursday, then.
47	Phoebe	 Yeah. Oh, can I come?
48	Monica	 Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
49	Rachel	 Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
50	Chandler	 I thought it was $98.50.
51	Rachel	 Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
52	Ross	 Well, I'm off to Carol's.
53	Phoebe	 Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
54	Ross	 (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
55	[Scene	 Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]
56	Ross	 Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
57	Susan	 No, she's at a faculty meeting.
58	Ross	 Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan
59	Ross	 Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
60	Susan	 What's it look like?
61	Ross	 Kinda like a big face without skin.
62	Susan	 Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
63	Ross	 Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
64	Susan	 Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
65	Ross	 (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
66	Susan	 Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
67	Ross	 The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
68	Susan	 What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
69	Ross	 You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
70	Susan	 Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
71	Ross	 Do you uh, do you talk about me?
72	Susan	 Yeah, yeah, all the time.
73	Ross	 Really?
74	Susan	 But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
75	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]
76	Ross	 Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
77	Phoebe	 Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
78	Chandler	 I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
79		(Rachel enters.)
80	Monica	 Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
81	Rachel	 No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
82	Monica	 Rach, here's your mail.
83	Rachel	 Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
84	Monica	 (insistently) No, here's your mail.
85	Rachel	 Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
86	Monica	 (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
87		(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)
88	Rachel	 Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
89	Monica	 We all chipped in.
90	Joey	 (to Monica) We did?
91	Monica	 (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
92	Rachel	 Thank you. Thank you so much!
93	Monica	 (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
94	Rachel	 Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
95	Chandler	 All right, I'm nine years old.
96	Ross	 Oh, I hate this story.
97	Chandler	 We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
98	Rachel	 Oh my god.
99	Chandler	 Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
100	[Scene	 The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.]
101	Joey	 Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
102	Girl	 We did?
103	Joey	 Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?
104	Girl	 Yeah, right.
105	Joey	 I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
106	Girl	 Get out.
107	Joey	 I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
108	Girl	 Really? You don't know what that means to me.
109	Joey	 Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
110	Girl	 (provocatively) Nothing.
111	Joey	 Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
112	Girl	 Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.
113	Joey	 What's wrong?
114	Girl	 I just remembered, I have to do something.
115	Joey	 Oh. What?
116	Girl	 Um, leave.
117	Joey	 Wait, wait, wait!
118	(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says	 What Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)
119	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.]
120	Joey	 So I guess you all saw it.
121	Rachel	 Saw what?
122	Phoebe	 No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
123	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey enters, upset.]
124	Joey	 Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
125	Chandler	 Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
126	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities.]
127	Monica	 Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
128	Ross	 I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
129	Monica	 All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
130	Ross	 That's closer.
131		(Rachel enters, excited.)
132	Rachel	 I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
133	Chandler	 Oh, you must stop shooping.
134	Rachel	 Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
135	Joey	 Chandler, will you just come in already?
136	Chandler	 No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
137		(Phoebe takes a slice of pumpkin pie and waves it in front of Chandler's face.)
138	Phoebe	 Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
139	Chandler	 Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
140		(Chandler leaves.)
141	Joey	 Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
142	Monica	 That's not a question.
143	Joey	 But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
144	Monica	 All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
145	Ross	 Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
146		(Ross grabs for some food, Monica slaps his hand away.)
147	Monica	 Ah!
148	Ross	 Ok, Mom never hit.
149		(Ross exits.)
150	Phoebe	 (stirring pot) Ok, all done.
151	Monica	 What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
152	Phoebe	 Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
153	Monica	 Why would we do that?
154	Phoebe	 Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
155	Monica	 Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
156	Rachel	 Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
157		(Chandler enters, running.)
158	Chandler	 The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
159	Joey	 The balloon?
160	Chandler	 No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
161	Rachel	 I can't, I gotta go.
162	Chandler	 Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
163	Phoebe	 Almost never.
164	Monica	 Got the keys? or Got the keys!
165	Rachel	 Ok.
166		(Everyone leaves the apartment.)
167	[Scene	 Carol and Susan's, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.]
168	Carol	 Anytime you're ready.
169	Ross	 Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
170	Carol	 Just aim for the bump.
171	Ross	 Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
172	Carol	 So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
173	Ross	 (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
174	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the group is coming back from the roof.]
175	Rachel	 I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
176	Phoebe	 Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
177	Monica	 Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
178	Rachel	 We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
179	Monica	 No I don't.
180	Rachel	 Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
181	Monica	 No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
182	Rachel	 No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
183	Chandler	 Do either of you have the keys?
184	Monica	 (panicked) The oven is on.
185	Rachel	 Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
186	Joey	 Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
187	Monica	 Well then get it, get it!
188	Joey	 That tone will not make me go any faster.
189	Monica	 (angry) Joey!
190	Joey	 That one will.
191		(Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.)
192	[Scene	 Carol and Susan's, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.]
193	Ross	 And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
194	Carol	 Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
195	Ross	 Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
196		(Susan enters.)
197	Susan	 Hi, how's it goin?
198	Ross	 Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
199	Carol	 I did.
200	Ross	 Does it always, uh--?
201	Carol	 No, no that was the first.
202	Susan	 Keep singing! Keep singing!
203	Ross	 (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
204	Susan	 I felt it!
205	Ross	 (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
206	[Scene	 The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]
207	Joey	 Nope, not that one.
208	Monica	 Can you go any faster with that?
209	Joey	 Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
210	Monica	 Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
211	Chandler	 (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
212	Rachel	 (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.
213	Monica	 I swear you said you had the keys.
214	Rachel	 No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
215	Phoebe	 Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
216		(Short pause.)
217	Monica	 Why would I have the keys?
218	Rachel	 Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
219	Monica	 But I didn't.
220	Rachel	 Well, you should have.
221	Monica	 Why?
222	Rachel	 Because!
223	Monica	 Why?
224	Rachel	 Because!
225	Monica	 Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
226	Chandler	 Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
227		(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)
228	Monica	 Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
229		(Ross enters, singing.)
230	Ross	 Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.
231	Monica	 No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
232	Rachel	 Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
233	Joey	 Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
234	Monica	 Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
235	Joey	 You call that delicious?
236		(all shouting)
237	Monica	 Stop it, stop it, stop it!
238	Chandler	 Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
239		[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]
240	Phoebe	 Ooh.
241	Rachel	 What?
242	Phoebe	 Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
243		(They all run to the window.)
244	Joey	 I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
245	Monica	 Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
246	Phoebe	 It's nice that he has someone.
247		[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]
248	Chandler	 Shall I carve?
249	Rachel	 By all means.
250	Chandler	 Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
251	Ross	 I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
252	Monica	 (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
253	Joey	 Oh, I will.
254	Phoebe	 Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
255	Monica	 Make a wish?
256	Phoebe	 Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
257	Joey	 The bigger half.
258	Chandler	 I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
259	All	 That's so sweet.
260	Ross	 And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
261	Rachel	 And a crappy New Year.
262	Chandler	 Here, here!
263	[Scene	 The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath. The captions read, as follows
264		Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
265		He's finally happy with that and walks away.]
266		End
