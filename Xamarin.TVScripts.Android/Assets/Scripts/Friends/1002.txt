4	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we took off in the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]
5	Joey	 Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
6	Rachel	 We weren't doing anything!
7	Joey	 Rach, he just saw us.
8	Rachel	 Shhh.
9	Joey	 But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
10	Rachel	 No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
11	Joey (to Rachel)	 Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
12	Rachel	 Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
13	Joey	 Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
14	Rachel	 We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
15	Joey	 Yeah, but it did happen, so...
16		(Ross looks shocked and says nothing.)
17	Joey	 Ross?
18	Rachel	 Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
19		OPENING CREDITS
20	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.]
21	Rachel	 Ross, say something. Anything.
22	Ross	 So you two are..?
23	Joey and Rachel	 Yeah.
24	Ross	 And have you .. ed?
25	Joey	 No, no, no!
26	Rachel	 No, no, no!
27	Ross	 But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
28	Joey	 Probably.
29		(Rachel looks at him.)
30	Joey	 No, no!
31	Rachel	 Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
32	Ross	 I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
33	Rachel	 No, but you know what I mean.
34	Ross	 Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (Squeaky.) I'm fine!
35	Joey	 Really?
36	Ross	 Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
37	Joey	 Ross..
38	Ross	 It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
39	Rachel	 Calm ourselves?
40	Ross	 No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
41	Joey	 Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
42	Ross	 Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)
43	Joey	 I do like fajitas.
44	[Scene	 Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of brochures about adoption in front of them.]
45	Monica	 God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
46	Chandler	 There's a hair in my coffee.
47		(Phoebe enters.)
48	Phoebe	 Hey guys!
49	Monica	 Hey.
50	Phoebe	 Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
51	Chandler	 You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
52		(Monica glares at him.)
53	Monica	 That's sweet. Drink your hair.
54	Phoebe	 Hey, what's all this stuff?
55	Monica	 Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
56	Phoebe	 Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
57	Monica	 That's not really how it works.
58	Phoebe	 Oh, how does it work?
59	Monica	 I don't know!
60	Phoebe	 Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
61	Monica	 Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
62		(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)
63		(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)
64	Frank Jr.	 Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
65		(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)
66	Frank Jr.	 That's not what we talked about!!
67	Phoebe	 Hey!
68	Frank Jr.	 Hey.
69	Phoebe	 Good to see you.
70	Frank Jr.	 Good to see you, too.
71	Monica	 Hi Frank.
72	Frank Jr.	 Hi, how you doin'?
73	Monica	 Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
74		(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is throwing bagels at him.)
75	Monica	 Which one is which again?
76	Frank Jr.	 Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
77	Monica (reads a form in her lap)	 "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
78	[Scene	 The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their way to Ross's dinner.]
79	Joey	 Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
80	Rachel	 Well, what would we be doing?
81	Joey	 I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
82	Rachel	 Feel me up?
83	Joey	 In a carriage!
84		(Charlie walks up to them.)
85	Joey	 Hey, Charlie!
86	Rachel	 Hey.
87	Charlie	 Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
88	Rachel	 Oh, you bet.
89		(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)
90	Joey	 So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
91	Charlie	 Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
92	Joey	 Oh. Oh, thanks.
93	Charlie	 And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
94	Joey	 Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
95		(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)
96	Ross	 I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.
97	Rachel	 Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
98	Ross	 Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
99	Joey	 Uh, actually, that's..
100	Ross	 Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
101	Charlie	 Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
102	Ross	 What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
103	Joey	 Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
104	Ross	 You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
105		(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)
106	[Scene	 Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]
107	Phoebe	 Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
108	Frank Jr.	 Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
109	Phoebe	 Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
110	Frank Jr.	 Yeah.
111	Phoebe	 Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
112	Frank Jr.	 I haven't slept in four years!
113	Phoebe	 That's a, that's a long time.
114	Frank Jr.	 You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
115	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
116	Frank Jr.	 Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
117	Phoebe	 What?
118	Frank Jr.	 No, I can't.
119	Phoebe	 Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
120	Frank Jr.	 Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
121	Phoebe	 What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
122	[Scene	 Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]
123	Monica	 Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
124	Colleen	 Oh, please, we're happy to help.
125	Bill	 We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
126	Chandler	 So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
127		(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)
128	Chandler	 I mean, you have a lovely home.
129	Monica	 Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
130	Colleen	 Well, actually, I think this might help.
131		(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)
132	Colleen	 It's pretty much all the information you need.
133	Monica	 Oh my god!
134	Colleen	 Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
135	Monica	 Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
136	Bill	 I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
137	Chandler	 That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
138		(Monica looks at him.)
139	Chandler	 You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
140	Monica	 It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
141	Colleen	 The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
142		(Chandler leaves.)
143	Colleen	 I would have told him to do it too.
144	Monica	 Can I adopt you?
145		(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)
146	Chandler	 Hey, you must be Owen.
147	Owen	 Yeah.
148	Chandler	 I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
149	Owen	 You were?
150	Chandler	 Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
151	Owen	 Huh?
152	Chandler	 You know how to use a compass?
153	Owen	 I have a badge in it.
154	Chandler	 You do? That's fantastic!
155	Owen	 You wanna see it?
156	Chandler	 I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
157	Owen	 What?!?
158	Chandler	 What?
159	Owen	 I'm adopted?
160		(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)
161	Chandler	 I got nothing.
162	[Scene	 Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still drinking all the margaritas.]
163	Ross	 The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
164	Rachel	 Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
165	Ross	 Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
166	Joey	 Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
167	Ross	 I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
168	Rachel	 No awareness.
169	Ross	 We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
170		(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)
171	Ross	 My fajitas!!
172		(He runs off to the kitchen.)
173	Rachel	 Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
174	Charlie	 Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
175		(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)
176	Charlie	 Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
177		(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven mitts.)
178	Ross	 Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
179	Rachel	 Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
180		(Ross laughs.)
181	Ross	 That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
182	[Scene	 Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. Continued from earlier.]
183	Phoebe	 Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
184	Frank Jr.	 No, of course we're not.
185	Phoebe	 Insane.
186	Frank Jr.	 I know.
187	Phoebe	 Alice would never go for it, right?
188	Frank Jr.	 Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
189	Phoebe	 Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
190	Frank Jr.	 Huh.
191	Phoebe	 Frank Jr.Jr.?
192	Frank Jr.	 Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
193	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
194	Frank Jr.	 What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
195	Phoebe	 Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
196	Frank Jr.	 Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
197	Phoebe	 Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
198	Frank Jr.	 Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
199	Phoebe	 Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
200	Frank Jr.	 Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
201	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
202	Frank Jr.	 How about tomorrow?
203	Phoebe	 Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
204	Frank Jr.	 You'd do that for us?
205	Phoebe	 Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
206	Frank Jr. (looks at the triplets)	 Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
207	[Scene	 Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the living room. Monica is the only one there.]
208	Chandler	 Where are Bill and Colleen?
209	Monica	 They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
210	Chandler	 We have to leave!!
211	Monica	 Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
212	Chandler	 I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
213	Monica	 Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
214		(Bill and Colleen enter.)
215	Colleen	 Hey.
216	Bill	 Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
217	Colleen	 I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
218	Chandler	 But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
219		(Owen comes running in.)
220	Owen	 I'm adopted?!
221	Chandler	 See? Intuitive!
222	Bill	 What? Where did you hear that?
223	Owen	 He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
224	Chandler	 Which technically now you should give back!
225	Colleen	 You told him he's adopted?
226	Chandler	 I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
227	Owen	 He isn't?!
228	Chandler (to Monica)	 We have to get out of here, baby!
229	[Scene	 Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas when Ross enters from the kitchen.]
230	Ross	 Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
231	Rachel	 Ooy.
232	Ross	 And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
233	Rachel	 Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
234	Ross	 O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
235		(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)
236	Joey	 Dude, are you okay?
237	Ross	 Totally.
238	Rachel	 Ross, you don't seem okay.
239	Ross (on the verge of tears)	 I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
240	Charlie	 Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
241	Ross	 No!
242	Charlie	 I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
243	Ross	 Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
244	Charlie	 You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
245	Ross	 Okay.
246	Charlie	 Alright.
247		(Ross goes to the kitchen.)
248	Charlie	 God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
249	Rachel	 Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
250	Charlie	 Bye.
251		(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)
252	Ross	 Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
253	Rachel	 You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
254	Ross	 Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
255	Rachel	 No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
256	Ross	 Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
257		(The oven timer pings again.)
258	Ross	 I don't even know what that's for.
259		(He goes back to the kitchen.)
260	Joey	 You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
261	Rachel	 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
262	Joey	 Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
263	Rachel	 Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
264	Joey	 It doesn't look good, does it?
265		(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)
266	[Scene	 Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]
267	Joey	 Morning. Here you go.
268	Ross	 Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
269	Joey	 Yeah.
270	Ross	 So you took off my pants and shoes?
271	Joey	 No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
272	Ross	 What do you mean?
273	Joey	 Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
274	Ross	 Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
275	Joey	 It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
276	Ross	 Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
277	Joey	 That's what I hear, yeah.
278	Ross	 This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
279	Joey	 Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
280	Ross	 Joey.
281	Joey	 I'm crazy about her.
282	Ross	 And she feels the same way?
283	Joey	 I think so.
284	Ross	 Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
285	Joey	 Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
286	Ross	 No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
287	Joey	 No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
288	Ross	 Yeah, I'm sure.
289	Joey	 And we're okay?
290		(Ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has forgotten about his burnt hands. He gasps in pain as Joey grabs his hand.)
291		ENDING CREDITS
292	[Scene	 Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter to find Phoebe there with the triplets.]
293	Monica	 Hey, Phoebs
294	Phoebe	 Hey.
295	Monica	 Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
296	Chandler	 Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
297	Monica	 What?
298	Phoebe	 Still, he had to find out sometime.
299	Chandler	 Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
300		(The triplets stare at him.)
301	Chandler	 I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
302		THE END
