2	[Scene	 A Video Store, Monica is running in to return a video.]
3	Monica	 (to clerk) Hi.
4		(The clerk enters the video into the computer.)
5	Clerk	 Six dollars, please.
6	Monica	 Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.
7	Clerk	 Eight o’clock is the cut-off and, (looks at his watch) aww, it’s 8
8	Monica	 Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.
9	Richard	 (standing behind her, without his moustache) I can help with that.
10	Monica	 Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
11	Richard	 Hi!
12	Monica	 Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.
13	Richard	 So, you look great.
14	Monica	 Right.
15	Richard	 No you do. You... just...
16	Monica	 What?
17	Richard	 You’ve got panties stuck to your leg.
18	Monica	 (removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.
19	Richard	 It’s good to see you.
20	Monica	 It’s good to see you too.
21		(They hug, and Richard notices a stocking stuck to Monica’s back, which he removes for her.)
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 continued from earlier.]
24	Monica	 You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.
25	Richard	 He’s gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. (they both laugh) This is nice.
26	Monica	 Yeah.
27	Richard	 I missed this.
28	Monica	 Me too.
29	Richard	 So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
30	Monica	 Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
31	Richard	 Oh. Look, just friends, I won’t grope you. I promise.
32	Monica	 No, I just I think that it’s too soon.
33	Richard	 No it’s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
34	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Ross. Joey, and Rachel are eating breakfast. Chandler is holding a bottle of Hersey’s Syrup.]
35	Chandler	 Yeah, baby!
36	Ross	 What are you doing?
37	Chandler	 Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
38	Ross	 No thanks. I’m 29.
39	Rachel	 (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
40	Ross	 Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?
41	Rachel	 Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.
42	Ross	 Oh come on, not again.
43	Rachel	 I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
44	Ross	 Hmm.
45	Rachel	 For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...
46	Ross	 Yeah.
47	Rachel	 I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.
48	Ross	 Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
49	Rachel	 Right.
50	Phoebe	 (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.
51	All	 Hey.
52	Joey	 (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
53	Phoebe	 Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
54	Ross	 And what are you going to do for him?
55	Phoebe	 I’m going to let him.
56	Ross	 Okay.
57	Joey	 Cool.
58	Monica	 (entering from her bedroom) Morning.
59	All	 Hey.
60	Rachel	 Somebody got in late last night.
61	Monica	 Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
62		(They all gasp)
63	Rachel	 When did this happen?
64	Monica	 Oh, um, around 8
65	Phoebe	 Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.
66	Ross	 So, are you gonna see him again?
67	Monica	 Tomorrow night.
68	Rachel	 Monica, what are you doing?
69	Chandler	 Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.
70	Monica	 It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
71	Joey	 Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.
72	Monica	 We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.
73	Ross	 Naked friends.
74	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]
75	Rachel	 (entering) Hey.
76	Joey	 Hey.
77	Rachel	 Do you have any ice?
78	Joey	 Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.
79	Rachel	 Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
80	Joey	 I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
81	Rachel	 Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
82	Joey	 Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
83	Rachel	 But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?
84	Joey	 Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
85	Rachel	 How often do you read it?
86	Joey	 Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?
87	Rachel	 Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?
88	Joey	 The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be
89	Rachel	 Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.
90	Joey	 All right, you got it.
91	Rachel	 All right.
92	Joey	 Okay.
93	Rachel	 Okay.
94	Joey	 Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
95	Rachel	 Yeah.
96	Joey	 How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
97	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there, Phoebe is entering with her date Robert.]
98	Phoebe	 Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
99	Chandler	 Oh, hey.
100	Robert	 Hi.
101	Ross	 Hey.
102	Phoebe	 (to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.
103	Ross	 Oh.
104	Chandler	 (to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?
105	Robert	 Well, I’m from California.
106	Chandler	 Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
107		(Robert leans back on the arm of the chair and allows Chandler to see up his shorts and sees ‘little Robert.’ Chandler is horrified by this view.)
108	Chandler	 (standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
109	Phoebe	 I’ll have coffee.
110	Robert	 Yeah, me too.
111	Ross	 Yeah, make that three.
112	Chandler	 Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?
113	Ross	 Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?
114	Chandler	 Robert’s coming out.
115	Ross	 What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
116	Chandler	 No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
117	Ross	 What?!
118	Chandler	 The man is showing brain.
119	Ross	 Are you sure? (Chandler nods
120	Robert	 Coffee.
121	Ross	 Okay.
122	Robert	 We could write it down for you?
123	Ross	 No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.)
124	Chandler	 (to Ross) Wellll?
125	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
126	Chandler	 What do we do? What do we do?
127	Ross	 Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
128	Chandler	 Like an eclipse.
129		(Ross nods his head.)
130	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is teaching Richard how to make lasagne.]
131	Richard	 So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
132	Monica	 You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
133		(They both start squishing the tomatoes.)
134	Richard	 Ew, this feels very weird.
135	Monica	 You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
136	Richard	 Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) That’s my hand.
137	Monica	 Oops.
138	Richard	 Okay.
139	Monica	 Gotta keep squishing.
140	Richard	 Tomatoes are squishing.
141	Monica	 Okay.
142		(Richard squishes a little too hard and some lands on his shirt.)
143	Richard	 Op.
144	Monica	 Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
145	Richard	 Yeah.
146	Monica	 Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....
147		(She is rubbing his chest and her voice trails off into silence, a long pause follows.)
148	Richard	 What?
149	Monica	 Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.
150	Richard	 I’ll just throw them out.
151	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is watching Joey read Little Women, Ross is also there.]
152	Joey	 These little women. Wow!
153	Chandler	 Your liking it, huh?
154	Joey	 Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.
155	Ross	 Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.
156	Joey	 But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
157	Chandler	 No, actually Laurie’s a boy.
158	Joey	 No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
159		(Enter Phoebe and Robert)
160	Phoebe	 Hey!
161	Chandler	 Hey.
162	Ross	 Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?
163	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
164	Chandler	 You mean a three pointer?
165	Phoebe	 Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.
166	Robert	 So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
167	Phoebe	 Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
168	Robert	 Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
169		(He puts his leg up on the couch to get the quarter, once again exposing himself to Chandler and Ross. In horror, Chandler, slides over and leans against Joey on the couch.)
170	Joey	 (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory) Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.
171	Robert	 Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
172		(Robert walks away and the guys all start laughing in front of Phoebe.)
173	Phoebe	 What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!
174	Ross	 Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.
175		(The guys start laughing harder.)
176	Phoebe	 You guys!! Come on!
177	Chandler	 I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
178	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
179	Robert	 Hey. (sits down)
180	Phoebe	 Hey.
181	Joey	 Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
182	Robert	 Sure.
183		(He puts his leg up on the table to pass Joey the cookies, and Phoebe sees what the guys are laughing at, and gasps.)
184	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to Richard on the phone.]
185	Monica	 So, how’d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It’s a word!
186		(There’s a knock on the door.)
187	Monica	 Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door and it’s Richard)
188	Richard	 You really sure?
189	Monica	 I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him)
190		Commercial Break
191	[Scene	 Monica’s bedroom, she’s in bed with Richard.]
192	Monica	 So we can be friends who sleep together.
193	Richard	 Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
194	Monica	 Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
195	Richard	 Just your dad. (pause) Although that’s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday.
196	Monica	 Oh.
197	Richard	 You want me to cancel it?
198	Monica	 No! (pushes him) No!
199	Richard	 Okay.
200	Monica	 ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.
201	Richard	 Exactly. (pushes her back)
202	[Scene	 Central Perk, Robert is picking up Phoebe for a date.]
203	Robert	 Hey.
204	Phoebe	 Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!
205	Robert	 You ready to go to the batting cage?
206	Phoebe	 Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.
207	Robert	 Oh! Wow! Hey!
208	Chandler	 Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
209	Robert	 Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don’t think I can wear these, they’re so tight, I feel like I’m on display. I’m sorry.
210	Phoebe	 That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)
211	Robert	 (to Joey) Hey!
212	Joey	 Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?
213	Ross	 Good.
214	Joey	 Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
215	Rachel	 Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
216	Joey	 Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
217	Rachel	 Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!
218	Joey	 All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
219	Chandler	 Hmmm, that’s very cool.
220	Joey	 Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
221	Rachel	 Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!
222	Chandler	 I can’t believe she cracked your code!
223	Rachel	 All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
224	Joey	 Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
225	Rachel	 Eh. Beth dies.
226		(Joey recoils and gasps in horror.)
227	Joey	 Beth, Beth dies?
228	Rachel	 Um-hmm.
229	Joey	 Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
230	Chandler	 No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?
231	Rachel	 What?!
232	Ross	 Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?
233	Rachel	 No. She doesn’t die.
234	Joey	 Then why would you say that?!
235	Rachel	 Because, I wanted to hurt you.
236	Robert	 (running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
237		(He bends over to pick them up, right in front of Rachel, who then gets a free peep show.)
238	Rachel	 (gasps) Oh my....
239	Robert	 Got ‘em.
240	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading The Shining, as Monica enters.]
241	Monica	 Hi.
242	Rachel	 (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.
243	Monica	 You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.
244		(Rachel starts laughing.)
245	Monica	 What are you smiling at?
246	Rachel	 I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.
247	Monica	 Yeah, right.
248		(She goes into her bedroom, and sees Richard who has covered the room in roses and has two glasses of wine and a rose between his lips.)
249	Richard	 Hello.
250	Monica	 I love this friend thing!
251	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there.]
252	Phoebe	 Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
253	Ross	 Oh.
254	Phoebe	 Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’
255	Chandler	 We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
256	Ross	 He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)
257	Robert	 (entering) Hey!
258	Phoebe	 Hey.
259	Robert	 (to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
260	Phoebe	 No, I can spot you from here.
261	Robert	 What?
262	Phoebe	 Okay, listen Robert...
263	Ross	 (to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to...
264	Chandler	 Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
265	Phoebe	 Umm, I think you’re really, really great...
266	Robert	 Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads his legs) Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
267	Phoebe	 I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.
268	Gunther	 (cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
269		(Robert looks down and realises the problem.)
270	[Scene	 Richard’s bedroom, Monica has covered it in rose pedals and candles. We hear Richard come in to the apartment, and Monica frantically throws the rest of the pedals on the bed, and jumps onto the bed and puts a rose in her mouth, and bites a thorn.]
271	Monica	 Ow!
272	Richard	 (outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
273	Richard’s Date	 Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
274	Monica	 Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)
275	Richard	 Ah well, this is the living room.
276	Richard’s Date	 Impressive.
277	Richard	 All right. This is the kitchen.
278	Richard’s Date	 Oh, that’s real pretty. Wait a minute, don’t I get to see the bedroom?
279	Richard	 The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical... (opens the door as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the room.) bedroom.
280	Richard’s Date	 We’re still on this side of the door.
281	Richard	 Um-hmm.
282	Richard’s Date	 Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.
283	Richard	 Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows her out)
284		[Cut to into the bedroom, with Monica still hiding under the covers. Richard enters and sits down next to her.]
285	Monica	 (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?
286	Richard	 Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
287	Monica	 (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
288	Richard	 Well, you seem fine.
289	Monica	 (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?
290	Richard	 You mean like exclusive friends?
291	Monica	 Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
292	Richard	 Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.
293	Monica	 That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.
294	Richard	 Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
295	Monica	 Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.
296	Richard	 I know I couldn’t. So....
297		(Monica kisses him.)
298	Monica	 How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?
299		(They both kiss, and Richard picks her up and goes over to the bed and starts to lie down.)
300	Monica	 Watch the thorns!
301	Richard	 (lying down) Ow!!
302		Closing Credits
303	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, and he’s very dejected.]
304	Rachel	 What?
305	Joey	 Beth is really, really sick.
306	Rachel	 Awwww.
307	Joey	 Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.
308		(Rachel hugs him)
309	Rachel	 Joey?
310	Joey	 Yeah.
311	Rachel	 Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
312	Joey	 (nodding his head) Okay.
313	Rachel	 Okay.
314		(Joey hands her the book and she puts it in the freezer.)
315		End
