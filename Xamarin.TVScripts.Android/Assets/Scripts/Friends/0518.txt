2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there. Joey is holding a deck of cards out to Chandler.]
3	Joey	 Okay, pick a card.
4	Chandler	 Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
5	Joey	 All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?
6	Chandler	 Oh yes.
7	Joey	 (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
8	Chandler	 (pause) Yes.
9		(Joey laughs then realizes the trick didn't work when Chandler hands him his card back.)
10	Carol	 (entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!
11	Ross	 Hi!
12	Chandler	 Hi there!
13	Ben	 Hi!!
14	Carol	 Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
15	Phoebe	 What are you talking about?!
16	Ross	 (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
17	Joey	 (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
18	Ross	 I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…
19	Joey	 I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
20	Chandler	 That.
21		Opening Credits
22	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating breakfast, Ross is heading for the bathroom.]
23	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
24	Joey	 Luck!
25	Chandler	 Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
26	Rachel	 Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
27	Chandler	 Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
28	Monica	 Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
29	Rachel	 Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
30	All	 Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)
31	Phoebe	 Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
32	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
33	Phoebe	 Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
34	Monica	 I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
35	Joey	 Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
36	Ross	 (from the bathroom) Okay!!
37	Joey	 Done.
38	Phoebe	 Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
39	Monica	 I would love to do it together!
40		(Joey starts to giggle.)
41	Joey	 They're gonna do it together.
42	Chandler	 Dude! That's my girlfriend!
43	Joey	 What, so I gotta shut it down now?
44	Ross	 All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
45	Monica	 It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
46	Ross	 Yeah.
47	Chandler	 Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
48	Joey	 Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
49	Ross	 Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
50	Joey	 Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
51	Ross	 You're not his godfather.
52	Joey	 What?! Are you kidding?!
53	Ross	 (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.
54	Joey	 All right!
55		(As they walk out he motions to Chandler that he is still Ben's godfather.)
56	[Scene	 Ben's audition, Carol, Ross, and Ben along with about 10 more families are in a waiting room as Joey enters happily.]
57	Joey	 Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
58	Ross	 Really? That's great!
59	Joey	 I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…
60	Carol	 (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of Variety to read) Hey, that kid looks familiar.
61	Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….
62	Ross	 Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
63	Joey	 That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
64	Ross	 Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
65	Joey	 I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
66	Carol	 Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
67	[Scene	 Rachel's new job, she's in her new boss's office (Kim's) and with the other assistant (Nancy). Together they're deciding what clothes to buy or something, who knows, let's all watch/read to find out.]
68	Kim	 So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
69	Rachel	 Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.
70	Kim	 Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
71	Nancy	 She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
72	Rachel	 (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.
73	Kim	 I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
74		(They all get up to leave.)
75	Kim	 (at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?
76	Rachel	 Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
77	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is telling Chandler and Monica about her day.]
78	Rachel	 …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
79	Monica	 That doesn't seem fair.
80	Rachel	 I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
81	Chandler	 Yeah, it is the best.
82	Rachel	 I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
83	Monica	 Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
84	Rachel	 Yeah, I can do that.
85	Chandler	 Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
86	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
87	Monica	 Hey!
88	Phoebe	 Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
89	Rachel	 I would love to!
90	Phoebe	 Oh good!
91	Chandler	 Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
92	Phoebe	 Oh good.
93		(They all start out.)
94	Phoebe	 Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)
95	Monica	 Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
96	Phoebe	 Oh, look at that.
97	Monica	 All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
98	Phoebe	 What happened to the intimate dinner party?
99	Monica	 Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…
100	Phoebe	 So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
101	Monica	 What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
102	Phoebe	 Like what?
103	Monica	 (Thinks) Cups.
104	Phoebe	 Cups? You're giving me cups?
105	Monica	 And ice!
106	Phoebe	 Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
107	Monica	 Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…
108	Phoebe	 I got it! Mine!
109	Ross	 (entering, downtrodden) Hi.
110	Monica	 Hey! How'd the audition go?!
111	Ross	 Not so good.
112	Monica	 Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?"
113	Ross	 (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
114	Joey	 (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
115	Monica	 You got a callback too didn't you?
116	Joey	 (Happily) Yeah I did!
117	[Scene	 The smoker's balcony, Rachel is out to join Kim and Nancy.]
118	Kim	 Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
119	Rachel	 Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
120	Kim	 Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
121	Rachel	 Oh great!
122	Kim	 So anyway we really… (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.) Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
123	Nancy	 Oh, sorry!
124	Rachel	 Oh that's okay.
125	Kim	 No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)
126	Nancy	 So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
127	Kim	 Oh that's great! You are the best!
128		(Rachel gets fed up and heads over to another smoker.)
129	Rachel	 Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
130	Nancy	 I thought you didn't smoke.
131	Rachel	 Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
132	Kim	 We get high.
133	Rachel	 Oh, me too.
134	Kim	 I'm kidding.
135	Rachel	 (Laughs) Oh, me too.
136	[Scene	 Ben and Joey's (Isn't that an ice cream??) callback.]
137	Ross	 Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
138	Joey	 Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…
139	Carol	 Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
140	Joey	 Who knows?
141	The Casting Director	 (entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
142	Ross	 Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long! Later!
143	Joey	 Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
144	Ross	 Yeah!
145	The Casting Director	 Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)
146	Joey	 Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
147	Ross	 Yeah, it is.
148	Kyle	 Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
149	Ross	 No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
150	Kyle	 Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
151		Commercial Break
152	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are talking.]
153	Phoebe	 (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!
154	Ross and Chandler	 Hi!
155	Phoebe	 Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
156	Chandler	 Ah sure. What's in 'em?
157	Phoebe	 Umm, cups.
158	Chandler	 Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
159	Ross	 Seriously that's a lot of cups.
160	Phoebe	 Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
161	Chandler	 Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
162	Phoebe	 Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!
163	Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
164	Ross	 Hey!
165	Joey	 Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
166	Ross	 What's up?
167	Joey	 Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
168	Ross	 Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
169	Joey	 That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
170	Ross	 Well, you just…
171	Joey	 I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
172	Ross	 What?!
173	Joey	 What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
174	Chandler	 (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
175	Ross	 Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
176	Joey	 At least I care about his feelings!
177	Ross	 What?!
178	Joey	 Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
179	Ross	 And why wouldn't he get it?
180	Joey	 Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
181	Ross	 Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
182	Joey	 You just give him a spoon baby!
183	Ross	 Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
184	Joey	 Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
185	Ross	 You're kid's name is Raymond!
186	Joey	 Yeah?! So's yours!
187	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there as Rachel enters.]
188	Monica	 (To Rachel) How did work go?
189	Rachel	 Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
190	Monica	 You stink!
191	Rachel	 Thanks!
192	Monica	 No, I'm-I'm serious!
193	Rachel	 Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
194	Chandler	 Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
195	Rachel	 I did not!
196	Chandler	 Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
197	Rachel	 All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
198	Chandler	 I wish I had smoked for my career…
199	Monica	 That's so gross!
200	Rachel	 No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
201	Chandler	 Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
202	Monica	 Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
203	Chandler	 I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
204	[Scene	 The smoker's balcony, Rachel, Kim, and Nancy are all puffing away on their cancer sticks.]
205	Kim	 So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
206	Nancy	 Absolutely!
207	Rachel	 I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
208	Kim	 Rachel didn't you just light that?
209	Rachel	 Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.
210	Nancy	 I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
211	Kim	 Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)
212	Nancy	 Tell me about it!
213	Rachel	 Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
214	Kim	 It does sound appealing.
215	Nancy	 Oh, I never could do it.
216	Rachel	 Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
217	Kim	 Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
218	Rachel	 Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
219	Kim	 My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding.
220	Rachel	 Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's lighter.)
221	[Scene	 Joey and Ben's audition, Joey is rehearsing his lines, uh correction, Joey is rehearsing his line.]
222	Joey	 Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!
223	Carol	 Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
224	Joey	 Oh yeah, no problem.
225	Carol	 Thanks. (Exits.)
226	Joey	 (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
227	Ross	 (entering, angrily) Joey!
228	Joey	 (angrily) Ross!
229	Ross	 (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!
230	The Casting Director	 (entering) Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
231		(Raymond and Joey go in the office.)
232	Joey	 Hi!
233	The Casting Director	 Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. (Some dude puts down a couple bowls of soup in front of them.)
234	Joey	 Uh-oh.
235	The Casting Director	 Is there a problem?
236	Joey	 Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
237	The Casting Director	 Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
238	Joey	 Oh, what did I say?
239	The Casting Director	 Hmm, noodle soup.
240	Joey	 How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!
241	The Casting Director	 All right, let's try one.
242		(Raymond and Joey both eat a spoonful and Joey turns to Raymond and says…)
243	Joey	 Hmm, noodle soup.
244	The Casting Director	 Okay. Let's do it again.
245	Joey	 Okay.
246		(They do it again.)
247	Joey	 Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
248	Raymond	 COME ON!!!!
249	The Casting Director	 Y'know what? We need to move on.
250	Joey	 No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)
251	[Scene	 The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are cheating and are caught by Rachel.]
252	Rachel	 Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
253	Kim	 Uh-oh, busted!
254	Rachel	 Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
255	Kim	 Yeah. That didn't work out.
256	Nancy	 Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
257	Rachel	 Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
258	Kim	 No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
259	Rachel	 Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
260	Kim	 Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
261	Rachel	 Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
262	Kim	 (to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
263	Rachel	 (hearing that) Oh man!
264	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel's surprise party. The apartment is festooned with cups. There are cups everywhere! Cup centerpiece, cup garland, etc., etc]
265	Phoebe	 (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)
266	Chandler	 Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
267	Monica	 (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
268		(Chandler starts to follow her into the kitchen.)
269	Phoebe	 (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!
270	Chandler	 Awesome!
271	Monica	 Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
272	Chandler	 There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
273	Monica	 Y'know…go! Go! Right there! (Points)
274	Chandler	 Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
275		(Rachel enters.)
276	Phoebe	 (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!
277	All	 Surprise!!
278	Rachel	 What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
279	Monica	 That's the surprise!
280	Rachel	 Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
281		(Everyone stops and looks at Chandler, who's nodding.)
282	All	 Surprise!
283	Rachel	 Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
284	Phoebe	 I was in charge of cups.
285	Rachel	 Oh, okay, not so weird.
286		[Cut to another part of the room, Ross is going to talk to Joey.]
287	Ross	 Hey!
288	Joey	 Hey.
289	Ross	 Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
290	Joey	 Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
291	Ross	 No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
292	Joey	 Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head in disgust.)
293	Ross	 Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
294	Joey	 What you do mean?
295	Ross	 I think, sub-consciously…
296	Joey	 Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
297	Ross	 (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
298	Joey	 Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…
299	Ross	 No!
300	Joey	 No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
301	Ross	 There you go. Thank you!
302	Joey	 Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
303	Ross	 No.
304	Joey	 Eh, what are you gonna do?
305		Ending Credits
306	[Scene	 The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are out smoking as Chandler sticks his head out the door.]
307	Chandler	 (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
308	Kim	 Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
309	Chandler	 Okay, great.
310		(Kim exhales and Chandler stares at it longingly.)
311	Kim	 (to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette) whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag from her cancer stick.)
312	Chandler	 I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
