4	Chandler	 Hey!
5	Ross	 Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
6	Chandler	 Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
7	Ross	 OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
8	Chandler	 No!
9	Ross	 OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
10	Chandler	 Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said "No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
11	Ross	 Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, even though there were NO LIGHTS !
12	Chandler	 So are you gonna...talk to her?
13	Ross	 Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
14	Chandler	 You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
15	Ross	 No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know I...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
16	Chandler	 No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
17	Ross	 I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me. And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
18	Chandler	 Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
19	Ross	 Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental Potluck dinner.
20	Chandler	 Why did I get married?!

25	[Scene	 Central Perk]
26	Joey	 Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I should have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
27	Phoebe	 Well it depends.
28	Joey	 On...?
29	Phoebe	 On how far along he's in the sex change process!
30	Monica	 No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to, your eyebrows are...
31	Joey	 Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
32	Phoebe	 Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
33	Joey	 Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
34	Phoebe	 Wow! Talking about high maintenance
35	Joey	 Hey hey! You dye your hair!
36	Phoebe	 I'm a woman!
37	Joey	 Arghhh! Double standards!
38	Phoebe	 Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
39	Monica	 Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
40	Phoebe	 But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
41	Monica	 It's just, I'm not good at singing.
42	Phoebe	 Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
43	Monica	 No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
44	Phoebe	 OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
45	Monica	 So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
46	Phoebe	 While drinking...
47	Monica	 I'm there!
48	Rachel	 Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
49	Phoebe	 Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
50	Rachel	 No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
51	Phoebe	 Oh my god.
52	Monica	 You kissed him?
53	Rachel	 Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
54	Monica	 Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
55	Phoebe	 It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
56	Monica	 Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
57	Rachel	 You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
58	Monica	 I thought you hated him?
59	Rachel	 You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
60	Monica	 So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
61	Rachel	 I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't know what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
62	Monica	 Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross
63	Rachel	 Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
64	Phoebe	 Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!

66	[Scene	 Beauty salon]
67	Salon girl	 Hi
68	Joey	 Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
69	Salon girl	 Name?
70	Joey	 Chandler Bing.
71	Salon girl	 Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.
72	Joey	 OK Thanks. (Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the stuff
73	Sonia	 I'll take care of it
74	Joey	 Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
75	Sonia	 Oh absolutely.
76	Joey	 Oh good...
77	Sonia	 Are you looking to meet somebody?
78	Joey	 All right let's just do this.
79	Sonia	 We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
80	Joey	 Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right! Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK (He tries to avoid the tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
81	[Scene	 Central Perk]
82	Chandler	 Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
83	Ross	 Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
84	Chandler	 Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
85	Ross	 That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
86	Chandler	 What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
87	Ross	 I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
88	Chandler	 Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
89	Ross	 No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
90	Chandler	 Did she go out with him?
91	Ross	 No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
92	Chandler	 Ah! The high road...
93	Ross	 You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there! Hey come with me!
94	Chandler	 Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
95	Ross	 You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, so they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
96	Chandler	 I thought I had to make the jokes!
97	Ross	 Don't you have to be at work?
98	Chandler	 Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
99	Ross	 Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question
100	Blonde girl	 Sorry...we were just leaving
101	Chandler	 We still got it!

104		
105	Rachel	 Who is it?
106	Gavin	 Gavin! I brought you some soup.
107	Rachel	 Why?
108	Gavin	 I heard you were sick...
109	Rachel	 Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin
110	Gavin	 I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
111	Rachel	 I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
112	Gavin	 Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
113	Rachel	 Oh no no no
114	Gavin	 So I had fun last night
115	Rachel	 So did I
116	Gavin	 Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
117	Rachel	 It's just a cold
118	Gavin	 Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
119	Rachel	 What? What's the matter?
120	Gavin	 What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
121	Rachel	 Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
122	Gavin	 Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything
123	Rachel	 Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. (She hears the noise of the key in the lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
124	Gavin	 Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
125	Rachel	 I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
126	Molly	 Hi!
127	Rachel	 Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
128	Molly	 No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
129	Rachel	 Right, right, yes!
130	Molly	 Don't panic!
131	Rachel	 What?
132	Molly	 There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
133	Rachel	 No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly. Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
134	Gavin	 Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
135	Molly	 Hello! I just go and get Emma.
136	Rachel	 OK.
137	Gavin	 So hum...Why did I have to hide?
138	Rachel	 I thought it was Ross.
139	Gavin	 So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
140	Rachel	 There isn't. There is totally isn't.
141	Gavin	 You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a rodeo clown.
142	Rachel	 All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in any relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so much history...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
143	Gavin	 It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
144	Rachel	 Yes
145	Gavin	 I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
146	Rachel	 People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
147	Gavin	 Don't be. It's just bad timing.
148	Rachel	 So seriously...rodeo clown?
149	Gavin	 One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...

151	[Scene	 Mike's piano bar]
152		
153	Phoebe	 "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
154		(Mike kisses Phoebe)
155	Mike	 Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth singing "I touch myself"...I'm not here to judge!
156	Phoebe	 Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
157	Monica	 No I told you I can't.
158	Phoebe	 But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
159	Monica	 What have you heard me sing?
160	Phoebe	 All the time when you're cooking.
161	Monica	 What?
162	Phoebe	 Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
163	Monica	 Yeah I do rock that one.
164	Phoebe	 OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
165	Monica	 Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
166	Mike	 Well I've got a book around...
167	Monica	 "Delta Dawn"
168		
169	[Scene	 Central Perk]
170		
171	Ross	 Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
172	Woman	 You already hit on me an hour ago
173	Ross	 Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
174	Chandler	 I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
175	Ross	 This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
176	Chandler	 By drowning or...?!
177	Michelle	 Why would he break up with me?
178	Her friend	 I don't know sweetie.
179	Michelle	 All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?
180	Chandler	 Well...
181	Ross	 I know! (he stands)
182		
183		
184	[Scene	 Piano bar]
185		
186	Mike	 All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica singing "Delta Dawn".
187	Monica	 Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
188	Phoebe	 Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone anyway.
189	Monica	 Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn" "Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
190	Phoebe	 Can you totally see through her shirt ?
191	Mike	 Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
192	Monica	 "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
193		
194	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's]
195		
196	Joey	 Hey, I need your help.
197	Chandler	 Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
198	Joey	 Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
199	Chandler	 I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
200	Joey	 You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they don�t match!
201	Chandler	 It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
202	Joey	 All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so I don�t look stupid for my pictures.
203	Chandler	 Ok. First of all, this is green!
204	Joey	 What the hell am I supposed to do!
205	Chandler	 All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
206	Joey	 What, what.
207	Chandler	 Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his �business� partners.
208	Joey	 Oh my God!
209	Chandler	 Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
210	Joey	 Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore plucking. It hurts so bad!
211	Chandler	 Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
212		
213	[Scene	 Piano Bar]
214		
215	Monica	 "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
216	Phoebe	 Every little bit of you!
217	Monica	 I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that one shouting �look at those tips�! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
218	Mike	 Sure.
219	Phoebe	 Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...
220	Monica	 Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.
221	Mike	 Also a good gift? Underwear.
222		
223	[Scene	 Ross']
224		
225	Michelle	 Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do anything else.
226	Ross	 But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
227	Michelle	 It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend, you get a boyfriend.
228	Ross	 Uh-ah!
229	Michelle	 No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
230	Ross	 (pfew). Good choice Ross.
231	Rachel	 Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you everywhere!
232	Ross	 Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
233	Rachel	 Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a chance to kind of talk� somebody here?
234	Ross	 Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.
235	Rachel	 Who?
236	Ross	 Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.
237	Rachel	 You�ve being seeing someone?
238	Ross	 Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this amazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it was a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
239	Michelle	 What are you taking amoxicillin for?
240	Ross	 How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s my roommate, Rachel.
241	Rachel	 Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother.
242	Michelle	 Ah, who is Emma?
243	Ross	 I told you about my daughter.
244	Michelle	 This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
245		
246	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's]
247		
248	Chandler	 And done!
249	Joey	 Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon
250	Chandler	 Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
251	Joey	 Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
252	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about there, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
253	Joey	 Thank you so much.
254	Chandler	 No problem.
255	Joey	 Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
256	Chandler	 Yeah.
257	Joey	 Comb my eyelashes.
258		
259	[Scene	 Piano Bar]
260		
261	Monica	 Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer Sisters �I am so excited�. And make it bouncy!
262	Phoebe	 Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
263	Chandler	 I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.
264	Monica	 Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!
265	Chandler	 Really? In front of all this people?
266	Monica	 And they love me!
267	Chandler	 Oh my God!
268	Phoebe	 Yes, she gives the people what they want.
269	Monica	 All right, watch!
270	Monica	 "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this time and show me some affection..."
271	Chandler	 Are those my wife�s nipples?
272	Phoebe	 Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
273	Chandler	 I gotta stop this.
274	Monica	 Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
275	Chandler	 You, touching yourself, out!
276		
277	[Scene	 Ross�]
278		
279	Rachel	 Wow. She does that a lot!
280	Michelle	 Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!
281	Rachel	 What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like an hour?
282	Michelle	 Actually about an hour and a half.
283	Ross	 I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
284	Michelle	 You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
285	Ross	 Are you kidding?
286	Michelle	 Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
287	Ross	 We�ll see.
288	Rachel	 Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
289	Ross	 I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
290	Rachel	 How do you know about that?
291	Ross	 Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
292	Michelle	 Emma.
293	Ross	 When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
294	Rachel	 Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
295	Michelle	 No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
296	Ross	 Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.
297	Michelle	 Well, call me!
298	Ross	 Ok.
299	Michelle	 No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!
300	Ross	 You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.
301	Rachel	 Score.
302	Ross	 Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony.
303	Rachel	 Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
304	Ross	 Oh, really!
305	Rachel	 Yeah.
306	Ross	 Oh, really!
307	Rachel	 Oh yeah.
308	Ross	 What about the guy from the bar?
309	Rachel	 What? Who?
310	Ross	 The guy you gave your number to.
311	Rachel	 Whoa, how do you know about that?
312	Ross	 Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing, ok? You�ve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn�t even have the courtesy to tell me.
313	Rachel	 Why didn�t I get that message?
314	Ross	 What?
315	Rachel	 From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?
316	Ross	 Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
317	Rachel	 Ross?
318	Ross	 I never gave it to you.
319	Rachel	 Why?
320	Ross	 I don�t know.
321	Rachel	 Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
322	Ross	 Who am I?
323	Rachel	 Yes.
324	Ross	 I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
325	Rachel	 Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you About us! But I can�t do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
326	Ross	 None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one Who moved on and didn�t tell anyone!
327	Rachel	 Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they Always ask, �what, you live together but you�re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn�t that weird?� And I say �No. You know what, it�s not, because it works for us!� But you know this doesn�t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
328	Ross	 Uh, clearly.
329	Rachel	 And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know, Just doesn�t make sense anymore.
330	Ross	 Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
331		
332	[Scene	 Joey's]
333		
334	Joey	 Hey!
335	Rachel	 Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
336	Joey	 Ha, oh, of course.
337	Rachel	 Thank you.
338	Joey	 Your eyebrows look weird.

342	Chandler	 �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him drink his wine.� So you just touch yourself for anything?
