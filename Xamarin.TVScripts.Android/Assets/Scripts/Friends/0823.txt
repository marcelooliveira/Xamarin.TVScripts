3	Ross	 All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
4	Rachel	 (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.
5	Ross	 No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
6		(Phoebe and Monica walk in from getting some coffee.)
7	Phoebe	 Oh you made it!
8	Rachel	 Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
9	Monica	 How are you doing?
10	Ross	 Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
11	Monica	 We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
12	Ross	 N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
13		(Chandler and Joey enter from the vending machines carrying sodas.)
14	Chandler	 Hi!
15	Joey	 Hey! You made it!
16	Ross	 Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
17	Rachel	 Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby.
18	Ross	 Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
19	Nurse	 Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute…
20	Rachel	 (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We (Laughs), we asked for a private room.
21	Nurse	 Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can’t guarantee a private room and currently they’re all unavailable.
22	Chandler	 Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)
23	Nurse	 I’m sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
24	Rachel	 Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
25	Ross	 Yeah?
26	Rachel	 Give her some money.
27	Ross	 I really think they’re out of rooms.
28	Rachel	 They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
29	Ross	 Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by Rachel.) Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
30	Nurse	 This is a hospital.
31	Rachel	 (standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!
32	Ross	 What-what?
33	Rachel	 Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.)
34	Nurse	 Would you like to see a semi-private room?
35	Rachel	 Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look.

39	Rachel	 Oh, okay.
40	Dr. Long	 I’ll be back in an hour to check you again.
41	Ross	 Thank you.
42	Rachel	 Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
43	Ross	 Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.
44	Rachel	 Yeah well it looks great!
45		(A nurse shows another couple into the room.)
46	Man	 Thank you very much.
47	Woman	 Thanks.
48		(They stop when they see Ross who has to struggle to get out of the bed.)
49	Ross	 Hi! Hi, I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.
50	Man	 Oh no-no, not at all.
51	Woman	 Don’t worry about it.
52	Man	 Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
53	Ross	 Hi Julie.
54	Julie	 Hi.
55	Ross	 This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
56	Rachel	 Hi!

58	Rachel	 How are you?
59	Julie	 Hi. Is this your first?
60	Rachel	 Yeah it is.
61	Julie	 Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.
62	Rachel	 That’s so sweet.
63	Ross	 Yeah.
64	Rachel	 Oh.
65	Ross	 Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
66	Marc	 No nonsense! We’re all in this together.
67	Julie	 Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we’re gonna have some fun.
68	Marc	 Yeah.
69	Ross	 Oh, okay.
70	Marc	 Hey! Smile! (Points his camera at Ross and Rachel.)
71	Rachel	 Oh no, I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…
72	Ross	 What?
73	Rachel	 Here comes another contraction.
74	Ross	 Oh. Okay, just breathe.
75	Julie	 Oh honey, I think I’m having one too!
76		(During the mutual contraction Julie takes a moment to point out they’re having a contraction at the same time.)
77	Marc	 Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!
78	[Scene	 The Waiting Room, the rest of the gang is lounging around.]
79	Phoebe	 (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
80	Monica	 Hey, you wanna see something?
81	Phoebe	 Sure! What?
82	Monica	 Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
83	Chandler	 Yeah?
84	Monica	 Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
85	Chandler	 Okay.
86	Monica	 (freaking out) What-what-what’s that now?!
87	Chandler	 Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re ready.
88	Monica	 What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a baby now?!
89	Phoebe	 Oh, this is fun.
90	Joey	 You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!
91	Chandler	 But you said you were ready too.
92	Monica	 Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
93	Chandler	 Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?
94	Monica	 Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) ‘Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
95	Joey	 (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!
96	Monica	 That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
97	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, time lapse, Ross is massaging out a cramp on Rachel’s hip as Marc opens up the privacy screen.]
98	Marc	 I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
99	Rachel	 Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.
100	Marc	 Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
101	Julie	 Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?
102	Rachel	 (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doing that.
103	Ross	 (simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.
104	Julie	 Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to compare.
105	Mrs. Geller	 (entering) Am I interrupting?
106	Ross	 Uh yes! Thank you.
107	Rachel	 Oh. Oh wait no.
108	Ross	 Later.
109	Rachel	 No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.
110	Ross	 Oh uh, I’m sorry. (Runs out.)
111	Rachel	 No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
112	[Scene	 The Hallway, Ross comes out and hugs Mrs. Geller.]
113	Ross	 Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.
114	Mrs. Geller	 Oh that’s all right, I’m coming back later with your father.
115	Ross	 Oh good.
116	Mrs. Geller	 I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
117	Ross	 Okay, what’s up?
118	Mrs. Geller	 I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it. (She holds up an engagement ring.)
119	Ross	 Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?
120	Mrs. Geller	 This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
121	Ross	 Mom no, come on! Thank you.
122	Mrs. Geller	 Just hear me out!
123	Ross	 N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?
124	Mrs. Geller	 Honestly! Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
125	Ross	 Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…
126	Mrs. Geller	 Just…think about it. If you don’t, I’ll talk more about humping.
127	Ross	 Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)
128	Rachel	 Hi!
129	Mrs. Geller	 Oh hi dear!
130	Rachel	 Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
131		(Mrs. Geller leaves as Ross re-enters the room.)
132	[Scene	 The Waiting Room, Ross is explaining to the gang what happened with his mother.]
133	Ross	 …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.
134	Phoebe	 Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?
135	Ross	 Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?
136	Phoebe	 But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
137	Ross	 Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
138	Phoebe	 Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
139	Joey	 God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?
140	Phoebe	 I know!
141	Joey	 I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and… (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
142	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, Ross is returning to find another couple has taken the place of Marc and Julie.]
143	Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?
144	Rachel	 New people.
145	Ross	 What happened to the Disgustingtons?
146	Rachel	 They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
147	Ross	 Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
148	Rachel	 Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
149	Ross	 Yeah? Okay.
150	Rachel	 Ooh! Ow!!
151	Evil Bitch	 Are you looking at her?!
152	Sick Bastard	 No!
153	Evil Bitch	 Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!
154	Sick Bastard	 Honey I swear! I wasn’t looking at her!
155	Evil Bitch	 She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
156	Ross	 Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)
157	Evil Bitch	 See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
158	Ross	 No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)
159	Evil Bitch	 You miss your girlfriend?
160	Ross	 Just ignore them.
161		(Sick Bastard sits down in a chair that enables him to look around the screen and stare at Rachel.)
162	Rachel	 Ross.
163	Ross	 What? What?
164	Rachel	 He’s looking at me.
165	Ross	 (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
166	Evil Bitch	 Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
167		(Ross shrugs his shoulders to Rachel and Sick Bastard closes the screen all the way.)
168	[Scene	 Outside the Nursery, Chandler is looking at the babies as Monica walks up.]
169	Monica	 Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
170		(The nurse attending to the babies hears this, turns and stares at Chandler. Chandler moves Monica to the side and away from the nurse.)
171	Monica	 What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
172	Chandler	 I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
173	Monica	 What?
174	Chandler	 Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.
175	Monica	 We are pretty good.
176	Chandler	 But nothing has to happen until your ready.
177	Monica	 Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.
178	Chandler	 What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
179	Monica	 What?!!
180	Chandler	 I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
181	Monica	 So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
182	Chandler	 We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
183	Monica	 Okay, hold on a sec.
184	Chandler	 Period math?
185	Monica	 Yeah.
186	Chandler	 Yeah.
187	Monica	 Well, we could start trying. Now.
188	Chandler	 Right here?
189	Monica	 No, not here. Maybe here.
190	Chandler	 Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!
191	Monica	 And it’s so clean!!
192		(They run off in search of a bed.)
193		Commercial Break
194	[Scene	 The Vending Machines, Phoebe is buying a soda and Joey is shaking the candy machine.]
195	Joey	 Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
196	Phoebe	 Oh, it ate your money?
197	Joey	 (looking at her) No.
198	Phoebe	 All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.
199	Joey	 All right.
200	Phoebe	 All right.
201	Joey	 Hey I got one! I got one!
202		[Cut to the elevator lobby, Phoebe walks up and sees a man in a wheelchair with his broken leg extended.]
203	Man	 Hi!
204	Phoebe	 Hi.
205	Man	 Oh uh, up or down?
206	Phoebe	 Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)
207	Man	 Could you press up too please?
208	Phoebe	 Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
209	Man	 Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?
210	Phoebe	 Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?
211	Man	 Car accident.
212	Phoebe	 Oh.
213	Man	 Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?
214	Man	 Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, that’s me. (Rolls onto the elevator.) Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.
215	Phoebe	 Uh-huh, yeah.
216	Man	 Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else…
217	Phoebe	 Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
218	Man	 I’m in the middle… (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)
219	Phoebe	 Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
220	Joey	 (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)
221	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, Evil Bitch and Sick Bastard are gone and Ross has just finished talking to a nurse as Rachel stands and stretches.]
222	Ross	 The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.
223	Rachel	 Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)
224	Ross	 That’s it. That’s it.
225		(The next couple enters.)
226	Woman	 Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
227	Rachel	 Yeah it was.
228	Woman	 Mine haven’t been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squeals a little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!
229		(Rachel motions for Ross to close the privacy screen, which he does.)
230	[Scene	 Another Waiting Room, Phoebe and Joey are trying to find out where the guy with the broken leg is.]
231	Phoebe	 (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
232	Nurse	 I think I know who you’re talking about.
233	Phoebe	 Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
234	Nurse	 I’m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff…
235	Joey	 (walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.
236	Nurse	 Dr. Drake who?
237	Joey	 Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.
238	Nurse	 A doctor at this hospital?
239	Joey	 Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?
240	Phoebe	 Hands.
241	Joey	 Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!
242	Nurse	 He’s in room 816.
243	Joey	 816, thank you!
244	Phoebe	 Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
245		(Joey starts to leave, but stops.)
246	Joey	 And what is his name?
247	Phoebe	 (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
248	[Scene	 An Empty Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter.]
249	Monica	 I think we found a place.
250	Chandler	 Okay. (They start kissing.)
251	Monica	 Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
252	Chandler	 Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
253	Monica	 Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
254		(He hops onto the bed and they start making out.)
255	Monica	 Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)
256	Chandler	 Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
257	[Scene	 Outside Room 816, Phoebe and Joey are approaching.]
258	Phoebe	 Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’s him!
259	Joey	 Great! Go get him.
260	Phoebe	 Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
261	Joey	 (looks in the window) He’s not really my type.
262	Phoebe	 No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.
263	Joey	 But you said he was this great guy!
264	Phoebe	 But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
265	Joey	 You do attract some stinkers.
266	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, Dr. Long is checking on Rachel again.]
267	Rachel	 Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
268	Dr. Long	 Three.
269	Ross	 Just three?! I’m dilated three!
270	Dr. Long	 We are moving along, just slowly. (Rachel lies back and sighs.) Don’t worry, you’re doing great. I’ll be back soon. (Exits.)
271	Rachel	 Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
272	Ross	 Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
273	Rachel	 Oh stupid metric system!
274		(Another woman with a nurse and doctor enter, the woman is screaming.)
275	Doctor	 Oh my. We’re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
276	Rachel	 Oh for the love of God!
277	Woman Giving Birth	 (yelling from the hallway) It’s coming! It’s coming!
278	Doctor	 And here it is! (The baby cries.)
279	Rachel	 Oh come on!!
280	[Scene	 Room 816, Dr. Drake Remoray is entering.]
281	Joey	 Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
282	Man	 Really? I’ve been dealing with Dr. Wells.
283	Joey	 I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
284	Man	 Dr. Wells is a woman.
285	Joey	 That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
286	Man	 Clifford Burnett.
287	Joey	 Date of birth?
288	Cliff	 November 16th, 1968.
289	Joey	 Age?
290	Cliff	 Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?
291	Joey	 I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
292	Cliff	 I’m 33.
293	Joey	 Okay. And uh, are you married.
294	Cliff	 No.
295	Joey	 Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
296	Cliff	 Are all the questions this personal?
297	Joey	 (checking the list) Yes.
298	Cliff	 Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.
299	Joey	 Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.
300	Cliff	 Yeah.
301	Joey	 Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
302	Cliff	 No.
303	Joey	 Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?
304	Cliff	 No!
305	Joey	 Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)
306	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, they’re brining in yet another woman.]
307	Nurse	 (calling to the woman) This room’s available.
308	Rachel	 Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he’s a lawyer!
309	Ross	 Uh Rach…
310	Rachel	 Go get back on that case honey!
311	Nurse	 I don’t think the next patient is very far along.
312	Rachel	 Okay, well then bring her in.
313		(Another nurse wheels the next pregnant woman in.)
314	Woman	 OH….MY….GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, it’s Janice.)
315		(Ross and Rachel are, needless to say, stunned at the arrival of Janice.)
316		Commercial Break
317	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, continued from earlier.]
318	Janice	 I….can’t….believe this!
319	Ross	 And yet somehow it’s true!
320	Janice	 I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies! (Does the laugh.)
321	Ross	 (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
322	Man	 (entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!
323	Janice	 Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)
324	Sid	 I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!
325	Ross	 (softly) Really?
326	Sid	 (To Janice) What’d he say?
327	Janice	 Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.
328	Rachel	 Oh!
329	Ross	 Oh there you go!
330	Rachel	 I get it!
331	Janice	 So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.
332	Rachel	 Oh we-we didn’t.
333	Ross	 No-no. We…
334	Janice	 What?!
335	Ross	 Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.
336	Janice	 Why?!!
337	Ross	 Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
338	Janice	 Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)
339	Rachel	 Just tell me how.
340	Janice	 Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during the contraction.)
341	Ross	 Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
342	[Scene	 Outside Room 816, Joey is briefing Phoebe on Cliff.]
343	Phoebe	 What else? What else?
344	Joey	 Uh, well he’s 33.
345	Phoebe	 Oh. Ah-uh.
346	Joey	 A widower.
347	Phoebe	 Oh.
348	Joey	 He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.
349	Phoebe	 Enter Pheebs.
350	[Scene	 Another Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter and start making out.]
351	Chandler	 Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?
352	Monica	 We could, or we can have sex in it.
353	Chandler	 Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
354		(They start making out again.)
355	Monica	 (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
356		(Suddenly they hear Janice laughing, and it ruins the moment.)
357	Monica	 Does that sound like Janice?
358	Chandler	 If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!
359	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, Chandler and Monica are entering to see if they in fact did hear Janice.]
360	Monica	 Hey!
361	Ross	 Hey!
362	Chandler	 Hi.
363	Rachel	 Oh hi.
364	Monica	 I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
365	Rachel	 Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
366	Chandler	 Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!
367	Janice	 Chandler Bing!
368	Chandler	 Jan-Janice!
369	Ross	 Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
370	Janice	 Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
371	Chandler	 Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
372	Janice	 It’s you. This is yours.
373	Chandler	 What?!
374	Janice	 (laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We haven’t slept together in years! (Laughs again.)
375	Chandler	 That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
376	[Scene	 Room 816, Phoebe is making her move on Cliff.]
377	Phoebe	 Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
378	Cliff	 I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you’re making me eat him.
379	Phoebe	 Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it? I’m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
380	Cliff	 No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy.
381	Phoebe	 Oh, I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)
382	Cliff	 Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
383	Phoebe	 Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.
384	[Scene	 The Semi-Private Labor Room, Janice is being moved to the delivery room and is screaming in pain.]
385	Rachel	 Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?
386	Ross	 Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
387	Rachel	 Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
388	Dr. Long	 Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero.
389	Rachel	 Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
390	Dr. Long	 Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room.
391	Rachel	 What?
392	Dr. Long	 Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.
393	Rachel	 My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
394	[Scene	 Room 816, Phoebe and Cliff are eating some pudding with spoons.]
395	Cliff	 Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)
396	Phoebe	 Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as Cliff sees something on TV.)
397	Cliff	 Oh my God! That’s the doctor who was in my room before!
398	Phoebe	 Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
399	Cliff	 I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
400	Phoebe	 Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
401	Joey	 (entering) Rachel’s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at him.) Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.
402	Cliff	 That-that’s him! You know him?
403	Phoebe	 Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.
404	Cliff	 I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
405	Joey	 Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)
406	Cliff	 And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
407	Phoebe	 You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
408	Cliff	 I don’t think so.
409	Joey	 Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
410	Phoebe	 Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.
411	Joey	 Right!
412	Phoebe	 Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.
413	Cliff	 It doesn’t happen to me either.
414	Joey	 Me neither.
415	[Scene	 The Delivery Room, Rachel is finally giving birth.]
416	Dr. Long	 Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5…4…
417	Rachel	 3-2-1 oh!!
418	Dr. Long	 Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
419	Rachel	 I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.
420	Ross	 Sweetie you’re doing great.
421	Rachel	 Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
422	Dr. Long	 Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
423	Ross	 What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
424	Rachel	 Don’t say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
425	Ross	 What is that?
426	Dr. Long	 It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech.
427	Ross	 Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
428	Rachel	 Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
429	Dr. Long	 She’s gonna be fine. Okay, she’s in a more difficult position so you’re gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
430	Ross	 Go!
431	Dr. Long	 Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!
432	Rachel	 I’m sorry, I can’t!
433	Ross	 Yes you can!
434	Rachel	 I can’t!
435	Ross	 Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
436	Rachel	 I can’t. Please, you do it for me.
437	Ross	 No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)
438	Dr. Long	 Good!
439	Ross	 (from the floor) Keep pushing!
440	Rachel	 Are you okay?
441	Ross	 You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
442	Dr. Long	 Here we go!
443	Ross	 Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
444	Rachel	 Oh God!
445	Ross	 Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
446		(The newest friend cries.)
447	Ross	 Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
448	Rachel	 Oh, she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?
449	Ross	 Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
450	Rachel	 Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.
451	Dr. Long	 Here she is!
452		(Dr. Long hands her to Rachel.)
453	Rachel	 Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.
454	Dr. Long	 Do we have a name yet?
455	Rachel	 No, not yet.
456	Dr. Long	 That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green.
457	Rachel	 Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
458		(Ross and Rachel look into each other’s eyes and kiss.)
459	Rachel	 Hello baby girl.
460		Commercial Break
461	[Scene	 The Recovery Room, Ross is taking pictures of Rachel holding the baby as the rest of the gang enters.]
462	Phoebe	 Can we come in?
463	Ross	 Oh, come in.
464	Phoebe	 Hi!
465	Joey	 There she is!
466	Phoebe	 Oh, she’s so beautiful.
467	Rachel	 Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
468	Monica	 Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
469	Chandler	 It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
470	Joey	 (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.
471	Rachel	 What?
472	Joey	 Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.
473	Phoebe	 Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t.
474		(Rachel starts crying again.)
475	Monica	 What’s the matter?
476	Rachel	 Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.
477	Ross	 The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.
478	Rachel	 So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)
479	Joey	 What’s the matter now?
480	Rachel	 I was reliving it.
481	Phoebe	 Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
482	Chandler	 So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
483	Phoebe	 Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
484	Ross	 Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
485	Rachel	 Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.
486	Ross	 Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?
487	Rachel	 That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.
488	Chandler	 So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
489	Joey	 What was the other one Ross?
490	Ross	 Umm, Delilah.
491	Rachel	 Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
492	Ross	 So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.
493	Phoebe	 Yay!
494	Rachel	 Well what are we going to do?
495	Monica	 It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.
496	Ross	 Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
497	Chandler	 You do?
498	Monica	 Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.
499	Chandler	 Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?
500	Rachel	 Well tell us! What are they?
501	Monica	 Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.
502	Rachel	 And if it’s a girl?
503	Monica	 I don’t want to say.
504	Rachel	 Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!
505	Monica	 Okay. It’s Emma.
506	Rachel	 (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t want it.
507	Monica	 Take it.
508	Rachel	 What?
509	Monica	 It’s clearly an Emma.
510	Rachel	 Oh honey, but you love that name.
511	Monica	 Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean… (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that’s you. You’re our little Em. Oh what’s that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!
512	[Scene	 A Janitorial Closet, Monica and Chandler are emerging slowly.]
513	Chandler	 That was amazing.
514	Monica	 I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
515	Chandler	 And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
516	[Scene	 The Recovery Room, Rachel is putting Emma down for a nap.]
517	Janice	 (entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
518	Rachel	 Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
519	Janice	 He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?
520	Rachel	 Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)
521	Janice	 Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.
522	Rachel	 Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
523	Janice	 Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
524	Rachel	 Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!
525	Janice	 I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.
526	Rachel	 Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
527	Janice	 Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
528	Rachel	 Really?
529	Janice	 I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on your own.
530	Rachel	 Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.
531	Ross	 (entering) Hey Janice!
532	Janice	 Oh hi!
533	Ross	 Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
534	Janice	 Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
535	Ross	 No-no. No.
536	Janice	 I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.
537	Ross	 Okay.
538	Janice	 Bye. (Exits.)
539	Ross	 Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
540	Rachel	 Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know what I was, I was thinking about?
541	Ross	 Huh?
542	Rachel	 Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
543	Ross	 Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?
544	Rachel	 (pause) Right.
545	Ross	 I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
546	Rachel	 No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn’t have any sodas?
547	Ross	 Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
548	Rachel	 That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
549	[Scene	 Outside the Nursery, Ross is looking at Emma as Phoebe walks up.]
550	Phoebe	 Is she in there?
551	Ross	 Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)
552	Phoebe	 Oh!
553	Ross	 Look at Emma!
554	Phoebe	 I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
555	Ross	 Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
556		(Pause)
557	Phoebe	 I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
558	Ross	 It’s…it’s complicated okay?
559	Phoebe	 Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
560	Ross	 Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.
561	Phoebe	 I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
562	Ross	 Yeah, exactly.
563	Phoebe	 Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.
564	[Scene	 The Delivery Room, Rachel is in bed as Joey enters.]
565	Joey	 Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (Notices she’s wiping her eyes.) What’s the matter?
566	Rachel	 Nothing.
567	Joey	 What is it? Hey!
568	Rachel	 Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
569	Joey	 Rach come on, what?
570	Rachel	 I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
571	Joey	 What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
572	Rachel	 Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
573	Joey	 Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
574	Rachel	 I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?
575	Joey	 Yeah, I guess so.
576	Rachel	 I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
577	Joey	 Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.
578	Rachel	 Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
579		(They hug.)
580	Joey	 You don’t have to worry about that okay?
581		(Pause)
582	Rachel	 Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.
583	Joey	 Sure.
584	Rachel	 Okay.
585		(He moves Ross’s coat to get the tissues and the engagement ring box Mrs. Geller gave him falls out of the pocket it was inside. Joey goes to one knee, picks up the box, opens it, and sees that it’s an engagement ring.)
586	Joey	 My God.
587	Rachel	 Joey.
588		(He turns to face Rachel on one knee with the box open.)
589	Rachel	 (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
590		(Joey is stunned.)
591		[Cut to Ross getting of an elevator carrying a bouquet of flowers and walking down the hall to Rachel’s room.]
592		[Fade to black.]
