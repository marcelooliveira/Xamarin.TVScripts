2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV, and we hear Mr. Treeger in the bathroom.]
3	Mr. Treeger	 Ohhh, man!!
4	Joey	 (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
5	Chandler	 Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
6	Mr. Treeger	 What in the name of hell?
7	Joey	 Maybe he found you flip-flop.
8		(Joey sits down and changes the channel, and we see two people making out.)
9	Chandler	 Hey!
10	Joey	 Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.
11	Chandler	 Do we pay for this?
12	Joey	 No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.
13	Chandler	 Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
14	Joey	 Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)
15	Mr. Treeger	 (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked.
16	Chandler	 Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
17	Mr. Treeger	 Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
18	Chandler	 Like finding money with naked people on it!
19	Mr. Treeger	 Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I’m sad. (Exits.)
20	Joey	 (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
21		Opening Credits
22	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that morning. The porn is still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy. Joey and Chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and Monica and Rachel are eating breakfast at the foosball table.]
23	Rachel	 All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)
24	Joey and Chandler	 (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!
25	Chandler	 We don’t know what could make this go away.
26	Joey	 Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
27	Chandler	 And no one touches the air around the TV!
28	Joey	 Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
29	Monica	 Well at least, I’m going to mute it.
30	Joey and Chandler	 Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)
31	Chandler	 We still have porn.
32	Joey	 Hey.
33	Phoebe	 (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!
34	Monica	 Hi!
35	Rachel	 Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.
36	Phoebe	 Yeah.
37	Rachel	 Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
38	Monica	 Okay.
39	Phoebe	 Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)
40	Chandler	 Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
41	Phoebe	 You mean like a doctor?
42	Joey	 Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!
43	Phoebe	 Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
44	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
45	Ross	 Hi.
46	Monica	 Hi.
47	Ross	 So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
48	Monica	 Oh. Why didn’t you take her?
49	Ross	 Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…
50	Monica	 You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
51	Ross	 (Thinks about it.) Nah.
52	Monica	 Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?
53	Ross	 Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"
54	Monica	 (interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.
55	Ross	 And why do you care so much?
56	Monica	 Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
57	Ross	 You had fantasies about Emily?
58	Monica	 No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
59	Ross	 Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
60	Monica	 Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
61	Ross	 Ahh.
62	Monica	 Do you love her?
63	Ross	 We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?
64	Monica	 You love her!
65	Ross	 What-what is love really?
66	Monica	 Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she’s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
67	Ross	 I am a good kisser.
68	Monica	 Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching too much porn.
69	[Scene	 Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OB-GYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel is with her. We here the baby’s heartbeat.]
70	Rachel	 Is that the heartbeat?
71	The Doctor	 That’s it.
72	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
73	Rachel	 Oh wow! This is so cool.
74		(The heartbeat changes, and we hear a different one.)
75	The Doctor	 Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
76	Phoebe	 Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?
77	The Doctor	 No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats.
78	Phoebe	 Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!
79	The Doctor	 Doctors are wrong all the time.
80	Phoebe	 Well, yeah.
81	Rachel	 Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
82	The Doctor	 Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)
83	Phoebe	 Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
84	The Doctor	 Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one.
85	Phoebe	 What do you know?!
86	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there, waiting to tell Frank and Alice the news.]
87	Alice	 (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!
88	Phoebe	 Ooh! Hi!
89	Alice	 Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebe’s stomach.) So, how did it go at the doctors?
90	Phoebe	 Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that’s nice?"
91	Frank	 Yes.
92	Phoebe	 Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.
93	Alice	 Three babies?
94	Frank	 I finally got my band!
95	Alice	 We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!
96	Phoebe	 Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
97	Frank	 Why would we be freaked?
98	Phoebe	 No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…
99	Frank	 (They’re less than happy now) Oh.
100	Alice	 Right.
101	Phoebe	 No, back to happy. Back to happy!
102	Alice	 No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop.
103	Frank	 Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
104	Alice	 No, Frank.
105	Phoebe	 No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
106	Frank	 Yeah, refrigerator college.
107	Alice	 Yeah.
108	Frank	 Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career—and I love refrigerators!
109	Phoebe	 You can’t give up on your dream.
110	Frank	 No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re gonna have three kids! And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
111	[Scene	 The airport, Emily is getting ready to board her flight to London.]
112	Ticket Agent	 (On the P.A.) This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
113	Ross	 Emily! (Runs up.)
114	Emily	 Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)
115	Ross	 I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
116	Emily	 You are so sweet. (They kiss.)
117	Ross	 That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
118	Emily	 Me too.
119	Ticket Agent	 This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
120	Emily	 Well, that’ me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him the candy bar.) I’m only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the jetway.)
121	Ross	 (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
122	Emily	 Oh. (She’s shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)
123	Ross	 That’s no problem.
124		Commercial Break
125	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Rachel is singing some kind of song.]
126	Rachel	 What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.
127	Chandler	 It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
128	Rachel	 Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
129	Joey	 Yeah right.
130	Rachel	 No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
131	Chandler	 Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
132	Rachel	 Yes!
133	Joey	 Yeah, he likes porn.
134		(Rachel starts to leave.)
135	Monica	 Where ya going?
136	Rachel	 I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!
137	Phoebe	 Hey.
138	Joey	 Hey!
139	Monica	 How did it go with Frank and Alice?
140	Phoebe	 Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
141	Chandler	 They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
142		(Ross enters.)
143	Monica	 Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
144	Ross	 I did.
145	Monica	 And well, what did she say?
146	Ross	 Thank you.
147	Monica	 Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?
148	Ross	 She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
149	Chandler	 Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
150	Joey	 Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
151	Ross	 What do I do now?
152	Joey	 You play hard to get.
153	Ross	 She already lives in London.
154	Joey	 Then you go to Tokyo.
155	Chandler	 All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.
156	Monica	 It is not over! You’re over!
157	Chandler	 What?
158	Monica	 You know!
159	Chandler	 Okay. (Pause) Good one.
160	Monica	 It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)
161	Ross	 Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.
162		(Joey holds his fist up, and Chandler gives him two thumbs up.)
163	Joey	 Way to be strong, man!
164		(Ross leaves, and after the door closes, Joey gives him the loser sign.)
165	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Joey enter having just woken up.]
166	Rachel	 Hey!
167	Chandler	 Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
168	Rachel	 Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?
169	Chandler	 Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
170	Phoebe	 (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.
171	Monica	 Hey!
172	Phoebe	 Hi!
173	Rachel	 Well, what-what ‘cha got there?
174	Phoebe	 Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking…
175	Chandler	 Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
176	Monica	 Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?
177	Phoebe	 No!
178	Monica	 Are you sure?
179	Phoebe	 No!
180	Rachel	 Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
181	Phoebe	 No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
182	Chandler	 What’s the second part of your plan?
183	Phoebe	 My Saturn dealership.
184	[Scene	 Ross’s bedroom, he has fallen asleep waiting for Emily to call. He is awaken by the phone.]
185	Ross	 (Answers the phone.) Hello?
186	Emily	 Ross.
187	Ross	 Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
188	Emily	 It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
189	Ross	 No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.
190	Emily	 Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else.
191	Ross	 Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
192	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is relating his recent conversation with Emily to the gang.]
193	Ross	 She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
194	Monica	 This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.
195	Ross	 Well…
196	Monica	 Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
197	Ross	 I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!
198	Chandler	 You put your fist through the wall?
199	Ross	 No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
200	Monica	 You have to go to London!
201	Ross	 What?
202	Monica	 Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
203	Joey	 Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!
204	Monica	 When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
205	Ross	 I made fun of his accent.
206	Monica	 You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
207	Ross	 No.
208	Monica	 All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
209	Ross	 Really?
210	Monica	 Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!
211	Ross	 All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!
212	Monica	 All right.
213	Ross	 I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.
214	Monica	 Okay, good luck!
215		(Ross starts to leave.)
216	Joey	 Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)
217	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
218	Rachel	 Hey!
219	Phoebe	 Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
220	Monica	 That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
221	Rachel	 Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
222	Phoebe	 I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
223	Rachel	 Okay.
224	Phoebe	 Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?
225	Chandler	 A place where no one will ever get out alive?
226	Phoebe	 No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…
227	Rachel	 (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
228	Phoebe	 The name was my favourite part!
229	Rachel	 Well, well I can up with it!
230	Phoebe	 YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.
231	Rachel	 Well, I…
232		(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
233	Monica	 Hello.
234	Ross	 (on phone) Hey.
235	Monica	 Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
236		[Cut to Ross in one of those British phone booths.]
237	Ross	 No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
238	Monica	 All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
239	Ross	 About four hours.
240	Monica	 Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.
241	Phoebe	 Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.
242	Rachel	 Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.
243	Phoebe	 Oh, that is better.
244	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. There is a knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.]
245	Chandler	 Are we in London?
246	Monica	 What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
247	Emily	 I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross.
248		(She sets her bag down on the foosball table and Joey sees the Toblerone bar sticking out of it and gazes longingly at it.)
249	Emily	 What?
250	Joey	 (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.
251	Emily	 I was going to call him, but…
252	Monica	 Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?
253	Emily	 I’d really rather talk to him.
254	Monica	 Oh.
255	Emily	 I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
256		[Cut to London, we sit Ross sitting outside Emily’s apartment. We hear Emily’s phone ring with amazing clarity. Apparently, sound travels quite easily through the walls of British buildings. Anyhoo, Ross looks around for the ringing phone and in the meantime Emily’s answering machine picks up and once again with amazing clarity we hear Emily say…]
257	Emily	 Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but… (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
258	Ross	 (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
259	Emily	 I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.
260	Ross	 Hi.
261	Emily	 Ross, I love you!
262	Ross	 Ohh! Thank you.
263		Closing Credits
264	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is still watching the porn as Chandler enters.]
265	Chandler	 Hey.
266	Joey	 Hey.
267	Chandler	 I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
268	Joey	 Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
269	Chandler	 What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
270	Joey	 Noo! Nothing!
271	Chandler	 Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
272	Joey	 I think you’re right.
273		(Goes over and picks up the remote.)
274	Chandler	 All right, ready?
275	Joey	 One.
276	Chandler	 Two.
277	Both	 Three.
278		(Chandler turns off the porn and sets the remote down.)
279	Joey	 That’s kinda nice.
280	Chandler	 Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.
281	Joey	 Yeah.
282		(Pause.)
283	Chandler	 You wanna see if we still have it?
284	Joey	 Yeah.
