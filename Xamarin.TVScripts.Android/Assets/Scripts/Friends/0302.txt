3	Joey	 All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)
4	Chandler	 Taste it.
5	Joey	 (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
6	Chandler	 Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
7	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
8	Chandler	 Hey, mister tux!
9	Ross	 Why aren't you guys dressed?
10	Joey	 We have a half hour.
11	Ross	 No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
12	Joey	 Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
13	Ross	 Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
14	Chandler and Joey	 Okay. (they don't move)
15	Rachel	 (entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
16	Ross	 Really.
17	Rachel	 Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
18	Ross	 Hi.
19	Rachel	 How come you didn't come over earlier?
20	Ross	 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
21	Joey	 Hey, Ross, want some cider?
22	Ross	 No. (to Rachel) So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
23	Rachel	 Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
24	Ross	 Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
25	Rachel	 Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
26	Joey	 Glass of fat?
27		Opening Credits
28	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's. Ross is acting nervous]
29	Joey	 What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
30	Ross	 No! Do you wanna hear it?
31	Joey	 Am I in it?
32	Ross	 Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
33	Phoebe	 (entering) Hello.
34	Ross	 Hey!
35	Joey	 Whoa!
36	Ross	 Wow, hello! You look great!
37	Phoebe	 Thank you! I know, though.
38	Ross	 You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
39	Phoebe	 Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
40	Chandler	 (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.
41	Joey	 What?
42	Chandler	 You're in my seat.
43	Joey	 How is this your seat?
44	Chandler	 'Cause I was sitting there.
45	Joey	 But then you left.
46	Chandler	 Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
47	Joey	 What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
48	Chandler	 The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
49	Joey	 Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom). Soo...
50	Ross	 You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
51	Chandler	 All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!
52	Monica	 (entering) Hi.
53	All	 Hey.
54	Monica	 Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
55	Phoebe	 All right all ready.
56	Monica	 (to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
57	Ross	 That's, that's funny. Change!
58	Monica	 Hang on a second I just got in.
59	Ross	 Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
60	Phoebe	 We could not, would not want to wait.
61	Ross	 Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
62	Monica	 Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)
63	Rachel	 (entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
64	Phoebe	 I don't know, you might be the first one.
65	Monica	 Rach, did you check the machine?
66	Rachel	 Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
67	Chandler	 Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called
68	Joey	 All right! You can have the chair.
69	Chandler	 Really!
70	Joey	 Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)
71	Phoebe	 (on machine) "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) Is that too spooky?
72	Ross	 (on machine) "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
73	Rachel	 (entering from her bedroom) What?!
74	Ross	 Nevermind.
75	Richard	 (on machine) "Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
76	Monica	 Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!
77	Ross	 It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
78	Monica	 What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
79	Chandler	 Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
80	Ross	 Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
81	Monica	 Huh?
82	Ross	 I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts to follow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There we go, there we go.
83	Chandler	 You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)
84	Phoebe	 Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
85	Chandler and Joey	 Sorry Phoebe.
86	Joey	 I'm so sorry.
87	Phoebe	 What am I gonna do?
88	Ross	 No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! (clapping) What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
89	Phoebe	 Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
90	Monica	 If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
91	Phoebe	 Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
92	Chandler	 Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
93	Monica	 So, should I call him back?
94	The Guys	 Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!
95	Chandler	 All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.
96	Joey	 Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
97	Chandler	 All right! (jumps up)
98	Ross	 Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
99	Chandler	 All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
100	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Is this a little too... (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, what happened?
101	Phoebe	 Hummus. I got the hummus.
102	Rachel	 Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
103	Phoebe	 That won't go with this dress though.
104	Rachel	 No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
105	Ross	 No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
106	Rachel	 Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
107	Monica	 I called him.
108	All	 Nooo.
109	Monica	 Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
110	Phoebe	 Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
111	Monica	 Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
112	Joey	 Monica, how are you gonna do that?
113	Monica	 I know the code to his answering machine.
114	Ross	 Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
115		(Chandler enters, and Joey is standing near the chair, they have a show down to see who gets the chair and Joey wins)
116	Richard	 (on machine) "Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
117	Machine	 "You have two new messages."
118	Joey	 Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
119	Monica	 (on machine) "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
120	Joey	 Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
121	Woman's Voice	 (on machine) Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
122	Joey	 Now she sounded breezy.
123		Commercial Break
124	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier]
125	Monica	 He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
126	Phoebe	 Monica, you don't know that.
127	Monica	 Well, who's voice was that?
128	Chandler	 Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
129	Monica	 Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
130	Ross	 Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
131	Monica	 It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
132	Rachel	 Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
133	Ross	 You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
134	Rachel	 Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
135	Ross	 Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
136	Chandler	 All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
137	Joey	 Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)
138	Chandler	 What are you doing?
139	Joey	 You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
140	Chandler	 The cushions are the essence of the chair!
141	Joey	 That's right! I'm taking the essence.
142	Chandler	 Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
143	Ross	 Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
144	Rachel	 Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
145	Ross	 Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
146	Rachel	 Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
147	Phoebe	 Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! (she's wearing another dress on a hanger around her neck)
148	Rachel	 Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
149	Phoebe	 Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
150	Ross	 Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
151	Rachel	 No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
152	Chandler	 We used them as pillows when we went camping.
153	Ross	 What?
154	Chandler	 (shyly) The sheep.
155	Ross	 Hey, what you do on your own time...
156	Joey	 (entering) Where's my underwear?!
157	Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
158	Chandler	 He took my essence!
159	Ross	 Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
160	Joey	 Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
161	Ross	 Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
162	Joey	 It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
163	Chandler	 Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
164	Joey	 Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
165	Chandler	 What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
166	Joey	 Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)
167	Chandler	 He's got nothing!
168	Phoebe	 (entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay, I'm ready.
169	Ross and Chandler	 Oh, aaaah!
170	Phoebe	 Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
171	Chandler	 What are you supporting?
172	Phoebe	 Duh!! Christmas!
173	Ross	 Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. (shows Chandler) Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. (grabs Chandler's watch) What time is it? It's 7
174	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
175	Ross	 Just, just, just pick one!
176	Phoebe	 Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
177	Rachel	 Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
178	Ross	 Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
179	Rachel	 But I...
180	Ross	 No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
181	Rachel	 All right.
182	Ross	 Thank you!
183	Monica	 (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
184	Ross	 It was, it was her voice.
185	Chandler	 Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
186	Michelle	 Hola! Hello. Hello?
187	Monica	 Okay. That was her right?
188	Phoebe	 Definitely.
189	Monica	 See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
190	Ross	 Yay!
191		(phone rings)
192	Phoebe	 I'll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel's. (listens) Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
193	Monica	 (on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
194	Chandler	 (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
195	Monica	 (on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
196	Ross	 No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
197	Monica	 Okay, fine. (runs to her room)
198	Chandler	 They got a phone in there, right?
199	Phoebe	 Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
200		(Rachel comes out from her room wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt)
201	Ross	 Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
202	Rachel	 I'm not gonna gooo.
203	Ross	 You're not going to go.
204	Rachel	 No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
205	Ross	 How, how, um how can you not be going?
206	Rachel	 I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
207	Ross	 Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
208	Rachel	 Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
209	Ross	 Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
210	Rachel	 It's fine.
211	Ross	 No, but, your-your mad.
212	Rachel	 I'm not mad.
213	Ross	 No.
214	Rachel	 I'm just not going.
215	Ross	 Your not going.
216	Rachel	 Right.
217	Ross	 Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
218	Rachel	 Um, hum.
219	Ross	 Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
220	Rachel	 No.
221	Ross	 No, because your not upset.
222	Rachel	 Right.
223	Ross	 About the yelling.
224	Rachel	 Right, and the humiliating.
225	Ross	 Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
226	Rachel	 Um, hum.
227	Ross	 We're good.
228	Rachel	 Right.
229	Ross	 Okay. Honey?
230	Rachel	 Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)
231	Ross	 I love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)
232	Phoebe	 (yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.
233	Chandler	 Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
234		(Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)
235	Joey	 Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
236	Chandler	 Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
237	Joey	 Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
238	Chandler	 Oooo-ooh!
239	Joey	 Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
240	Ross	 Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
241	Chandler	 Jeez, what a baby.
242	Joey	 Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
243	Ross	 You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
244	Joey	 You could drink the fat.
245	Ross	 Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
246	Rachel	 No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
247	Ross	 What?
248	Rachel	 I think you should drink the fat.
249	Joey	 Yaaaay!
250	Ross	 Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
251	Phoebe	 Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
252	Ross	 I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him just before he starts drinking)
253	Rachel	 No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
254	Ross	 You will?!
255	Rachel	 You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
256	Ross	 Well, yeah.
257	Rachel	 You were gonna drink the fat.
258	Joey	 Let's see what else he'll do!
259	Ross	 (to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
260		(Joey and Chandler start to leave, Joey is lunging as he is walking)
261	Chandler	 Stop it. Stop it!
262		(Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)
263	Phoebe	 Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
264	Richard	 (on machine) Hi, this is Richard.
265	Machine	 You have three new messages.
266	Monica	 Not any more!
267	Machine	 Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
268	Monica	 Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
269	Machine	 Your outgoing message has now been changed.
270	Monica	 Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
271	Monica	 (on machine) "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
272	Phoebe	 How did you do that?
273	Monica	 I don't know!
274	Machine	 Good-bye.
275	Monica	 Noooo!!!!
276	Ross	 (entering) Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
277	Monica	 Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
278	Phoebe	 Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
279	Ross	 Rachel!! (she enters) Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
280	Rachel	 And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that was about seven seconds.
281	Ross	 So we're a little late.
282	Rachel	 Come on. (they start to leave) Oh! And, uh, by the way....
283	Ross	 What?
284	Rachel	 I'm going commando, too.
285	Ross	 Awwww!!!
