3	Rachel	 So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
4	Monica	 Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
5	Phoebe	 Oh my God, they took my idea!
6	Monica	 That was you?!
7	Phoebe	 Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)
8	Gunther	 (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
9		[He distracts her from catching Monica and Monica slams into her, knocking her down. Monica then falls on top of her.]
10	Phoebe	 Oh my God, are you guys okay?
11	Gunther	 Are you all right?
12	Joey	 (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is moaning in pain.) Oh my.

15	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching Quincy M.E. as Chandler is walking into the living room from his bedroom.]
16	Chandler	 (sporting a goatee) Hey.
17	Joey	 Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
18	Chandler	 Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me. (there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
19	Joey	 Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?
20	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
21	Chandler	 Hey.
22	Ross	 (triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!
23	Chandler	 No way!
24	Ross	 Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
25	Chandler	 Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
26	Ross	 Thanks. You ready to go?
27	Chandler	 Yeah. (they start to leave)
28	Joey	 Saw a girl with that vest.
29	Chandler	 Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
30	Anchorwoman	 (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won’t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
31	Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
32	[Scene	 The Moondance Diner, Pete is entering, Monica is on roller skates.]
33	Pete	 Hi!
34	Monica	 Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to skate over to him)
35	Pete	 Wow! Skates!
36		(She gets just about all the way over to him and falls into his arms.)
37	Monica	 Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?
38	Pete	 Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)
39	Monica	 Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
40	Pete	 Yeah, sure, that’d be great.
41		(She starts to go and get the coffee and falls behind the counter.)
42	Monica	 (popping back up) Regular or decaf?
43	Pete	 Ah, which ever is closest.
44	Monica	 Okay. (hands him a cup)
45	Pete	 So ask me what I did today.
46	Monica	 So what did you do today Pete?
47	Pete	 I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
48	Monica	 What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
49	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is telling Rachel about Pete’s offer.]
50	Monica	 Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
51	Rachel	 What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
52	Monica	 I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.
53	Rachel	 And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
54	Monica	 Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
55	Rachel	 Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
56	Monica	 Oh, please.
57		(She slaps Rachel’s side and Rachel screams in pain.)
58	Monica	 What? Honey.
59	Rachel	 Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
60	Monica	 Oh God, I’m so sorry.
61	Rachel	 I know.
62		(Monica hugs her goes and hugs her)
63	Rachel	 Ow!!
64	Monica	 Oh God!
65	Ross	 (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys! Guess what?
66	Rachel	 (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
67	Ross	 Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
68	Rachel	 Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
69	Ross	 Right.
70	Rachel	 Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
71	Ross	 (to Monica) You like it right?
72	Monica	 Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. (Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!
73	Rachel	 Yeah, come here!
74	Monica	 What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
75	Rachel	 Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
76	Ross	 Okay, good bye! (leaves)
77	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about her suggestion.]
78	Chandler	 So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
79	Phoebe	 Umm, oh, about three months.
80	Chandler	 Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
81	Joey	 (entering carrying a box) Hey!!
82	Chandler	 Hey!
83	Joey	 I got you something! Open it! Open it!
84	Chandler	 Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.
85	Joey	 It’s cute, huh?
86	Phoebe	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
87	Chandler	 Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
88	Phoebe	 Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
89	Joey	 Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)
90	Chandler	 Easy Lenny.
91	[Scene	 The Moondance Diner, Pete is talking to Monica about the restaurant.]
92	Pete	 So? I mean have you thought about it?
93	Monica	 Okay. Here’s the thing.
94	Pete	 Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?
95	Monica	 I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
96	Pete	 Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.
97	Monica	 Huh?
98	Pete	 No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
99	Monica	 Oh?
100	Pete	 Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
101	Monica	 Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
102	Pete	 I guess you can.
103	Monica	 Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
104	Pete	 All right.
105	Monica	 Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
106	Pete	 Yeah, sure. Good luck!
107	Monica	 (rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
108	Phoebe	 (to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
109	Pete	 What?
110	Phoebe	 I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
111	Pete	 Why would you say that?
112	Phoebe	 ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
113	Pete	 You’re good. You’re good!
114	Phoebe	 Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
115	Pete	 Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?
116	Phoebe	 Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
117	Pete	 Thanks a lot.
118	Phoebe	 No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
119	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is baby-chick sitting.]
120	Chandler	 Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.
121	Joey	 Hey.
122	Chandler	 Hey.
123	Joey	 How’s she doing?
124	Chandler	 She?
125	Joey	 Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
126	Chandler	 I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
127	Joey	 Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
128	Chandler	 Excuse me?
129	Joey	 What?
130	Chandler	 I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
131	Joey	 Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
132	Chandler	 You don’t think I get up when you get up?
133	Joey	 Ohhh, here it comes.
134	Chandler	 Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!
135	Joey	 Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
136	Chandler	 And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
137	Joey	 That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
138	Chandler	 I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
139	Joey	 I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
140	Chandler	 I’ll take her back tomorrow.
141	Joey	 Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
142	Ross	 (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
143	Chandler	 Hey!
144	Ross	 (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This blue suit, or this brown one?
145	Joey	 Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
146	Ross	 Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look)
147	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to take some aspirin.]
148	Rachel	 (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
149	Ross	 Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
150	Rachel	 (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
151	Ross	 Oh my God, is that still...
152	Rachel	 I’m fine, I’m fine.
153	Ross	 No you’re not.
154	Rachel	 Yes I am!
155	Ross	 Rach!
156	Rachel	 Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!
157	Ross	 (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
158	Rachel	 No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.
159	Ross	 And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
160	Rachel	 Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.
161	Ross	 Rach...
162	Rachel	 But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
163	Ross	 Rachel...
164	Rachel	 Look, either help me or go.
165	Ross	 Fine. I’ll go.
166	Rachel	 (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
167	Ross	 (He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.
168	Chandler	 (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
169		Commercial Break
170	[Scene	 Rachel’s bedroom, Rachel is trying to put on eye liner with her left hand, as Ross is setting out her shoes.]
171	Rachel	 (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
172	Ross	 Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He doesn’t like how it tastes.)
173	Rachel	 (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him another one.)
174	Ross	 Okay. This stuff?
175	Rachel	 Yeah.
176	Ross	 All right.
177	Rachel	 Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
178	Ross	 Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
179	Rachel	 Oh-ho!
180	Ross	 Sorry.
181	Rachel	 Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!
182	Ross	 Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...
183	Rachel	 Okay, just sweep it.
184	Ross	 I’m sweeping...
185	Rachel	 Right.
186	Ross	 Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she has a black eye.)
187	Rachel	 Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...
188	Ross	 What? What?
189	Rachel	 We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
190		(Of course it’s too late for that.)
191	Ross	 No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel is shocked) What?
192	Rachel	 Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
193	Ross	 Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)
194	Rachel	 Blow it.
195	Ross	 (blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
196	Rachel	 Sophisticated like a hooker?
197	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is entering, Phoebe is already there.]
198	Monica	 Hey!
199	Phoebe	 Hey!
200	Monica	 Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.
201	Phoebe	 What?
202	Monica	 I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
203	Phoebe	 Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
204	Monica	 I know.
205	Phoebe	 Ooh, I have to tell you something.
206	Monica	 What?
207	Phoebe	 But I can’t tell you.
208	Monica	 Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
209	Phoebe	 Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
210	Monica	 Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
211	Phoebe	 No.
212	Monica	 Does it have to do with Joey?
213	Phoebe	 No.
214	Monica	 Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
215	Phoebe	 No, but let’s come back to that later!
216	[Scene	 Rachel’s Bedroom, Ross is finishing up her make-up.]
217	Ross	 There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
218		(She turns and looks in the mirror, and it’s way, way over done. She looks like she has two black eyes.)
219	Rachel	 Sure.
220	Ross	 Yep?
221	Rachel	 Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
222	Ross	 Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
223	Rachel	 Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
224	Ross	 (checks his watch) Sure, okay.
225	Rachel	 Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
226	Ross	 What?
227	Rachel	 I don’t want you to see me naked!
228	Ross	 Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
229	Rachel	 Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird.
230	Ross	 Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
231	Rachel	 What?
232	Ross	 All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
233	Rachel	 Ross! Stop that!
234	Ross	 Ah, I’m sorry.
235	Rachel	 Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
236	Ross	 Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!
237	Rachel	 Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
238	Ross	 Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.
239	Rachel	 Rosss...
240	Ross	 Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.
241	Rachel	 All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.
242	Ross	 Yowzah!!!
243	Rachel	 O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
244	Ross	 Aww, come on.
245	Rachel	 That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!!

261	Rachel	 Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?
262	Ross	 (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
263	Rachel	 Okay.
264	Ross	 Okay? (goes into the living room)
265	Rachel	 Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain) Oww!!!! God!
266	Ross	 (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?
267	Rachel	 I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.
268	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is trying to find out what Phoebe won’t tell her.]
269	Monica	 Does it involve travel?

273	Monica	 Clogs.
274	Phoebe	 No.
275	Monica	 Claws?!
276	Phoebe	 No.

278	Phoebe	 (Shaking her head yes) No!
279	Monica	 What is it?! What about Pete?
280	Phoebe	 I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica)
281	Monica	 Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
282	Phoebe	 I can’t!!
283	Monica	 Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)
284	Phoebe	 I, but you’re so close! No!

290	Chandler	 Hey!
291	Joey	 (sees he’s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
292	Chandler	 I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
293		(Joey wants to know, but Chandler doesn’t want to discuss it by the chick, so he and Joey move over to the windows and away from the chick.)
294	Chandler	 If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
295	Joey	 Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
296	Chandler	 Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!
297	Joey	 That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
298	Chandler	 Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.
299		(He hear a duck start quacking, and see it waddle into the living room from the bathroom. Joey wants to know what’s with the duck.)

302	Monica	 I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
303	Pete	 So you like it?
304	Monica	 Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)
305	Pete	 Oh, you’re welcome. (He takes a deep breath)

309	Pete	 What?
310	Monica	 You still have feelings for me don’t you?
311	Pete	 Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all.
312	Monica	 Pete.
313	Pete	 Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
314	Monica	 No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.
315	Pete	 Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
316	Monica	 You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.
317	Pete	 What?
318	Monica	 And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.
319	Pete	 Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.
320	Monica	 Okay, bye.
321		(She kisses him on the cheek, and he kisses her back on the mouth.)
322	Pete	 I’m sorry things didn’t work out...

327	Rachel	 Okay.
328		(As they approach the door, Chandler comes out carrying his duck.)
329	Chandler	 Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
330	Ross	 (to Chandler) That’s a duck.
331	Chandler	 That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight, Ross?
332	Ross	 Oh, it was, nah, well....
333	Rachel	 What thing? What thing?
334	Ross	 Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her apartment) Easy.

336		[cut to inside Monica and Rachel’s]
337	Rachel	 What thing? What is this thing?
338	Ross	 I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
339	Rachel	 Oh my God!
340	Ross	 Yeah.
341	Rachel	 Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?
342	Ross	 Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
