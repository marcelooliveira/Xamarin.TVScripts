2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]
3	Ross	 Hey!
4	Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe	 Hey!
5	Ross	 I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?
6	Phoebe	 Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)
7	Ross	 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)
8	Phoebe	 Where were you?
9	Ross	 Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
10		(simultaneously)
11	Chandler	 Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
12	Phoebe	 Oh, which museum?
13	Phoebe	 (just Phoebe) No, answer his.
14	Ross	 Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
15	Chandler	 Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
16	Ross	 No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
17	Chandler	 How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
18	Joey	 Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)
19		Opening Credits
20	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
21	Chandler	 Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
22	Phoebe	 Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.
23	Chandler	 All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.
24	Rachel	 Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.
25	Chandler	 Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
26	Rachel	 Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.
27	Joey	 Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.
28	Chandler	 Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
29	Rachel	 Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?
30	Chandler	 Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
31	Rachel	 Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.
32	Chandler	 Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
33		(Monica enters)
34	All	 Hey!
35	Phoebe	 What’s wrong Mon?
36	Monica	 Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
37	Phoebe	 Oh.
38	Monica	 I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)
39	Phoebe	 Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’
40	Rachel	 Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
41	Monica	 I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)
42	Joey	 Ohhh!
43	Monica	 I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.
44	Rachel	 Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
45	Monica	 I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.
46	Chandler	 Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.
47	Joey	 Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?
48	Monica	 That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
49	Joey	 Good enough to get fired.
50	Monica	 All right, you’re hired!
51	Joey	 Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
52	Chandler	 (he glares at him for a while) Yes.
53	[Scene	 Chandler’s office, he is trying to find Rachel a date.]
54	Chandler	 I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!
55	Drew	 I didn’t think you were gay. I do now.
56	Chandler	 See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
57	Drew	 Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.
58	Chandler	 Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
59	Mike	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
60	Chandler	 (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
61	Mike	 Oh wow! I’m free for her!
62	Drew	 Oh, wait a second! I didn’t say I wasn’t free!
63	Mike	 Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
64	Drew	 Hold on, y’know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
65	Chandler	 Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
66	Mike	 Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
67	Chandler	 Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!
68	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is working on a new song.]
69	Phoebe	 Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
70	Monica, Rachel, and Joey	 Yes!
71	Phoebe	 (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
72	Rachel	 Pheebs, that’s great!
73	Phoebe	 Oh, yay!
74	Rachel	 But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.
75	Phoebe	 I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
76	Joey	 What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
77	Phoebe	 All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?
78	Monica	 Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
79	Rachel	 Oh yeah!
80	Phoebe	 Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
81	Chandler	 (entering) Hello, children!
82	All	 Hey!
83	Chandler	 (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
84	Rachel	 Really?!
85	Chandler	 Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?
86	Joey	 Sure! Where are the seats?
87	Chandler	 Wherever! I’ve got like 20!
88	Rachel	 So, will I like any of these guys?
89	Chandler	 Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
90	Rachel	 Chandler!
91	Chandler	 Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
92	Phoebe	 (shocked) You work with robots!!
93	Chandler	 (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.
94	Rachel	 Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!
95	Chandler	 Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
96	Rachel	 Op, I like credit cards!
97	Chandler	 See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
98	Rachel	 Well, so what does he do?
99	Chandler	 Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
100	Rachel	 Your company has a fine foods division?
101	Chandler	 It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…
102	Joey	 Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
103	Phoebe	 No! No, the robots just work for them.
104	Monica	 (getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
105	Joey	 Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
106	Monica	 You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
107	Joey	 Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
108	Monica	 You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.
109	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, and Chandler are there.]
110	Ross	 Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
111	Chandler	 Oh yeah! With who?
112	Ross	 You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
113	Chandler	 Yeah.
114	Ross	 Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.
115	Phoebe	 If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
116	Ross	 Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.
117	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
118	Ross	 Hey!
119	Chandler	 Hey, man!
120	Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
121	Joey	 (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
122	[Scene	 Allesandro’s, Monica is cooking.]
123	Joey	 (entering from the dining room) Hey.
124	Monica	 Hey.
125	Joey	 Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a burn spot on it)
126	Monica	 They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.
127	Joey	 You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)
128	Monica	 What are you doing?!
129	Joey	 It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.
130	Monica	 Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!
131	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is there.]
132	Rachel	 (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
133	Chandler	 Well, like father, like son.
134	Rachel	 Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
135	Chandler	 Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
136	Rachel	 Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?
137	Chandler	 Ummmmmmmm, no.
138	Rachel	 You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!
139	Chandler	 Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.
140	Rachel	 Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.
141	[Scene	 Allesandro’s, Joey is eating some cheese.]
142	Monica	 Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
143	Joey	 Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
144	A Waiter	 (entering) Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday. (hands him two envelopes)
145	Joey	 (opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!
146	The Waiter	 Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
147	Monica	 Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?
148	The Waiter	 Because we can remember them.
149	Monica	 Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
150	The Waiter	 Well, sure, that too.
151	Monica	 Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…
152	The Waiter	 Can’t hear you!
153	Monica	 (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
154	Joey	 No ma’am.
155	The Waiter	 Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)
156		Commercial Break
157	[Scene	 Allesandro’s, continued from earlier. The other waiters are gone and Monica is confronting Joey about his not speaking up.]
158	Monica	 What the hell happened?!
159	Joey	 I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!"
160	Monica	 Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!
161	Joey	 And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.
162	Monica	 What kinda things have you been saying?
163	Joey	 Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
164	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is working on her holiday song, Chandler is sitting on the couch reading a magazine, and Ross is sleeping on the couch.]
165	Phoebe	 (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…
166	Chandler	 (interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?
167	Phoebe	 What?
168	Chandler	 I’m not Jewish, so…
169	Phoebe	 So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)
170	Chandler	 Bad dream?
171	Ross	 I wasn’t sleeping.
172	Chandler	 Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?
173	Ross	 The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.
174	Phoebe	 So, did you pick one yet?
175	Ross	 No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
176	Phoebe	 Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!
177	Ross	 Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.
178	Phoebe	 Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
179	Chandler	 Prague?
180	Phoebe	 There’s sooo much you don’t know.
181	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing living room golf as Rachel enters. Rachel sees this and holds the door open until Chandler is ready to start his swing, when he is, she slams the door shut which causes the club to fly from his hands. He turns around, shocked.]
182	Rachel	 Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
183	Chandler	 I did! I absolutely did!
184	Rachel	 You idiot!!
185	Chandler	 I’m sure you’re right, but why?
186	Rachel	 You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
187	Chandler	 Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.
188	Rachel	 Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
189	Chandler	 I know! I know!
190	Rachel	 Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
191	Chandler	 Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)
192	Rachel	 Really?
193	Chandler	 Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
194	Rachel	 No.
195	Chandler	 Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
196	Rachel	 Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
197	Chandler	 Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.
198	Rachel	 Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
199		(pause)
200	Chandler	 Have you ever been with a woman?
201	Rachel	 What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
202	Chandler	 So there is no good time to ask that question.
203	[Scene	 A train to Poughkeepsie, Ross is asleep against the window.]
204	The Conductor	 The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
205	The Woman From Poughkeepsie	 (outside Ross’s window) Ross? Ross! (she knocks on the window) Wake up! Ross! (the train starts moving) Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
206	[Scene	 Allesandro’s, Monica is cooking.]
207	Monica	 I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?
208	Kitchen Worker	 I don’t speak English.
209	Monica	 You did a minute ago!
210	Kitchen Worker	 Well, I don’t know what to tell ya!
211	Monica	 Fine!
212		(She goes into the freezer to get it herself, and leaves the door open. The waiter from earlier comes by and closes the door.)
213	Monica	 Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)
214	The Waiter	 You found that handle, did ya?
215	Monica	 That’s not funny.
216	The Waiter	 Well that’s not true.
217	Monica	 (starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…
218	Joey	 (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
219	Monica	 You do?
220	Joey	 You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.
221	Monica	 Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
222	Joey	 What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
223	Monica	 You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
224	The Waiter	 No.
225	Monica	 How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?
226	The Waiter	 No, it’s really good.
227	Monica	 Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!
228	[Scene	 The train, it’s pulling into a station.]
229	The Conductor	 Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
230	Ross	 (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
231	Woman On Train	 I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
232	Ross	 What?
233	Woman On Train	 We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
234	Ross	 (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
235	Woman On Train	 Yes we are. So, coffee?
236	Ross	 Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
237	Woman On Train	 Oh, no. But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
238	[Scene	 Allesandro’s, Joey is coming back in with his coat on.]
239	Joey	 Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
240	Monica	 Thanks.
241	Joey	 Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
242	Monica	 Enough!
243	Joey	 (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
