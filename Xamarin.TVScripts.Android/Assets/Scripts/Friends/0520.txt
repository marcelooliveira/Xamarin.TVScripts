2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Rachel, Joey, and Monica are sitting on the couch as Ross is up getting some coffee.]
3	Monica	 Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
4	Joey	 Oh, yeah, good idea.
5		(Ross returns.)
6	Chandler	 Hey man, what's up?
7	Ross	 (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.)
8	Joey	 Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)
9	Ross	 (turning and looking) What? Where?
10	Joey	 Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
11	Ross	 What am I looking at?
12	Joey	 (to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!
13	Phoebe	 (entering, with Gary) Hey!
14	Gary	 Hello!
15	Monica	 Hey!
16	Gary	 How are you?
17	Phoebe	 Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
18	Joey	 You got to go on a ride along?!
19	Phoebe	 Uh-huh!
20	Joey	 I want to go on a ride along!
21	Ross	 Me too!
22	Gary	 Okay!
23	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah! Me too!
24	Gary	 Really?! You?
25	Chandler	 Yeah.
26	Gary	 Well, it's kinda dangerous.
27	Chandler	 Well, I like danger.
28	Gary	 Okay, you guys free tonight?
29	Joey and Ross	 Yeah!!
30	Chandler	 Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
31		Opening Credits
32	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is kneeling at the coffee table and has a bunch of pictures laid out in front of her as Rachel enters.]
33	Rachel	 Hey!
34	Monica	 Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
35	Rachel	 Ohh, thank God! Finally!
36	Monica	 Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)
37	Rachel	 Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
38	Monica	 You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
39	Rachel	 Great! Thanks!
40	Monica	 All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
41	Rachel	 Okay.
42		(She picks up the box and the bottom falls out, spilling all of the pictures onto Monica's neat little piles.)
43	Rachel	 Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
44	Monica	 I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
45	Rachel	 Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
46	Ross	 Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
47	Rachel	 No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
48	Monica	 All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
49	Rachel	 Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
50	Monica	 Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…
51	Rachel	 What?!
52	Monica	 What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
53		(Rachel slowly leaves the apartment.)
54	[Scene	 Gary's cop car, Ross is in the front seat with Gary of course. Chandler is in the back seat.]
55	Ross	 (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
56	Chandler	 It is starting to get dark out there.
57	Ross	 (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
58	Gary	 Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
59	Chandler	 (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
60		(Gary reaches up to grab that little light that cops have for unmarked cop cars.)
61	Ross	 Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
62	Gary	 It's called the cherry.
63	Ross	 It's the—Chandler!!
64		(Chandler starts laughing at his joke.)
65	Joey	 (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
66	Gary	 Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
67	Joey	 Oh-ho, yeah!
68	Gary	 Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
69	Joey	 Yep!
70	Gary	 Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
71	Joey	 (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
72	Chandler	 Your tax dollars?
73	Joey	 Yeah, okay.
74		[Time lapse, they're still on the ride along and Joey is just sniffing his sandwich.]
75	Chandler	 (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
76	Joey	 Did I say you could smell it?!
77	Chandler	 I can't smell your sandwich?
78	Joey	 Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
79	Chandler	 Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
80	Joey	 Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
81	Chandler	 Okay.
82	Joey	 Are you thinking about Monica?
83	Chandler	 Yeah.
84	Joey	 Yeah, what's that like?
85	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Rachel is just entering. She takes off her coat and heads for the kitchen. As she does, she knocks something off of a bookcase next to the kitchen door with her coat and it breaks.]
86	Rachel	 Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
87	Monica	 (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
88		(Rachel runs over and answers the phone with the blender in hand.)
89	Rachel	 Hey! What's up?!
90	Monica	 I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
91	Rachel	 So all we have is ice?
92	Monica	 See if he has ice.
93	Rachel	 Okay.
94		(She hangs up the phone and starts to head back to the kitchen and notices some money lying out, stops, reaches down to pick it up, the phone rings causing her to drop it, she quickly puts it back, and heads for the kitchen.)
95	Emily	 (on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into the room with the tequila.) I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
96	Rachel	 Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
97	[Scene	 The ride along.]
98	Ross	 So where are we going next?
99	Gary	 This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
100	Chandler	 Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
101	Joey	 Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
102	Gary	 It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
103	Ross	 Yeah, no one talks like that!
104	Joey	 Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
105	Ross	 Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
106	Chandler	 How do you figure that?
107	Ross	 Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
108	Chandler	 Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
109	Ross	 Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
110	Gary	 Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
111	Ross	 Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
112	Gary	 Ross!
113	Ross	 Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
114		(Gary just glares at him.)
115		[Time lapse, Ross has been demoted to the back seat with Joey and Chandler. He's not too happy about it.]
116	Chandler	 Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
117	Joey	 Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
118	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Rachel is playing Emily's message to Monica.]
119	Emily	 (on answering machine) Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
120	Monica	 (does Rachel's) Nooo!
121	Rachel	 (does Monica's) I know!
122	Monica	 Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
123	Rachel	 What?! We can't do that!
124	Monica	 We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
125	Rachel	 Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
126	Monica	 I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?
127	Rachel	 I don't think he's the one who needs help.
128		(They both sit down.)
129	Monica	 No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
130	Rachel	 Ugh!
131	Monica	 Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
132	Rachel	 Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)
133	Answering Machine	 Your messages have been erased.
134	Rachel	 Noooooooo!
135	[Scene	 The ride along, they're all waiting outside of the witness's house and still in the car in the same places as before.]
136	Chandler	 Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
137	Gary	 No. But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this.
138	Ross	 What is it?
139	Gary	 Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
140	Chandler	 (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
141	Gary	 Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
142	Ross	 What? What? What? What is it?
143	Joey	 Is everything okay?
144	Chandler	 What's going on?
145	Gary	 Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
146		(They all turn and look away. Suddenly a loud bang sounds out and in slow motion Joey slowly throws his body over Ross. Gary is shocked at what he sees while Chandler is obviously hurt.)
147	Gary	 Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. (Joey slowly moves off of Ross.) Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
148	Joey	 (To Ross) You okay man?
149	Ross	 Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
150	Chandler	 Uh, HELLO!!
151	Joey	 Hi.
152		Commercial Break
153	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Monica has all the supplies she needs and is getting ready to leave.]
154	Monica	 All right, I guess we should go.
155	Rachel	 No, wait. Wait.
156	Monica	 Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
157	Rachel	 No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
158	Monica	 There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
159	Rachel	 Yeah well unless we tell him.
160	Monica	 Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
161		(The phone rings.)
162	Rachel	 Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
163	Ross	 (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
164	Monica	 Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
165	Rachel	 Right?
166	[Scene	 Central Perk, the guys are returning from the ride along to find Phoebe already there.]
167	Gary	 Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
168	Phoebe	 (excited) John Glenn is here?!
169	Gary	 No, Joey!
170	Ross	 Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…
171	Gary	 Wait! Hold on! (He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe) Hi!
172	Phoebe	 Hi!
173	Gary	 (To Ross) Okay, go ahead.
174	Ross	 Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
175	Phoebe	 My God, Joey!
176	Chandler	 (pouting) It was a car backfire!
177	Ross	 Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
178	Joey	 Yeah, I didn't know that.
179	Ross	 And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
180	Gary	 Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
181	Chandler	 Who jumps at loud noises!
182	Ross	 Wow! I could've died tonight.
183	Chandler	 Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)
184	Ross	 I do have a newfound respect for life.
185	Chandler	 (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
186	Gary	 (To Phoebe) So you wanna get some dinner?
187	Phoebe	 Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
188	Gary	 Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
189	Phoebe	 Okay!
190	Gary	 All right.
191	Phoebe	 Bye!
192	Ross and Joey	 Bye!
193		(They leave as Ross stares in awe at Joey.)
194	Joey	 Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
195	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is pacing as Joey enters.]
196	Joey	 Dude! How come you took off?
197	Chandler	 Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…
198	Joey	 Is something wrong?
199	Chandler	 No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
200	Joey	 Okay.
201	Chandler	 You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
202	Joey	 That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
203	Chandler	 I do not hate Ross!
204	Joey	 Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
205	Chandler	 What picture?
206	Joey	 I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
207	Chandler	 Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
208	Joey	 Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
209	Chandler	 When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
210	Joey	 Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
211	Chandler	 From a bullet!
212	Joey	 I know it doesn't make much sense…
213	Chandler	 Much sense?!
214	Joey	 Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
215	Chandler	 So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
216	Joey	 I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
217	Chandler	 So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
218	Joey	 No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
219	Chandler	 Really?!
220	Joey	 Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.
221	Chandler	 Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
222	Joey	 No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
223		(Chandler takes a bite.)
224	Joey	 How good is that?
225	Chandler	 (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
226	Joey	 See?
227	Chandler	 Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
228	Joey	 Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
229	Chandler	 I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
230	Joey	 Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!
231	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Rachel is trying to repair the thing she broke earlier, but gets interrupted by hearing Ross at the door. She panics and throws the thing into the kitchen. And runs to the couch as Ross enters.]
232	Rachel	 Hey! Hi!
233	Ross	 Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
234	Rachel	 Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
235	Ross	 Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
236	Rachel	 Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
237	Ross	 The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
238	Rachel	 What?! What? What happened?!
239	Ross	 Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
240	Rachel	 Yeah!
241	Ross	 And somebody took a shot at me!
242	Rachel	 (gasps) Really?!
243	Ross	 No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
244	Rachel	 Because a car backfired?
245	Ross	 (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?
246	Rachel	 Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
247	Ross	 You talked to her?
248	Rachel	 No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
249	Ross	 Well, okay, what-what did she say?
250	Rachel	 Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
251	Ross	 Wow!
252	Rachel	 Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
253	Ross	 Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
254	Rachel	 Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
255	Ross	 Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
256	Rachel	 Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
257	Ross	 Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
258	Rachel	 Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
259	Ross	 You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
260	Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
261	Ross	 Huh.
262	Rachel	 I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
263	Ross	 That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
264	Rachel	 Well, there you go!
265	Ross	 Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
266	Rachel	 (laughing) Close call day.
267	Ross	 Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)
268	Rachel	 Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
269	Ross	 Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
270	Rachel	 Oh?
271		(Ross hits the playback button.)
272	Ross	 (on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
273	Rachel	 No. (She heads for the door again.)
274	Ross	 (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
275	Rachel	 Yeah.
276	Ross	 Yeah, I want my money back.
277	Rachel	 (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
278		(Ross is stunned.)
279		Ending Credits
280	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there.]
281	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
282	Phoebe	 Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
283	Ross	 I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
284	Monica	 Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
285	Chandler	 Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
286	Ross	 I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
287	Chandler	 Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
288	Joey	 Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)
289	Phoebe	 Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.
290		(Joey gets all happy with himself, while the rest of the gang is less than enthused.)
