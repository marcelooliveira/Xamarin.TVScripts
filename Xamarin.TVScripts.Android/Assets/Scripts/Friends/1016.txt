5	[Scene	 Joey's place. Rachel and Joey are talking]
6	Joey	 All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
7	Rachel	 Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
8	Joey	 Just flip!
9	Rachel (she flips the coin)	 Ha, tails!
10	Joey	 Damnit!
11		(Chandler and Monica enter the room)
12	Chandler	 Hey!
13	Joey	 Hey!
14	Chandler	 So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
15	Rachel	 Oh, that sounds good!
16	Monica	 Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
17	Rachel	 It's all done!
18	Monica	 Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
19	Rachel	 I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
20	Monica	 Ok, so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?
21	Rachel	 Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
22	Monica	 Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)
23	Chandler	 Where's your passport?
24	Rachel	 It should be right next to my plane ticket.
25	Chandler	 Well, it's not.
26	Rachel	 What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
27	Monica	 Here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)
28	Rachel	 Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
29	Chandler (to Joey)	 At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?

31		OPENING SEQUENCE
32	[Scene	 Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica are talking about the baby, and Monica is rubbing Erica's tummy.]
33	Monica	 Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
34	Erica	 I know.
35	Monica	 You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
36	Erica	 No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
37		(She takes her hand off Erica. Ross enters the room)
38	Ross	 Hey!
39	Erica	 Hi.
40	Ross	 Hey Erica, welcome back to town! (pause) Wow, look how big you've gotten.
41	Erica	 That's because I'm pregnant!
42	Ross	 Right, no, I understand.
43	Erica	 Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
44	Ross	 No, no, I knew (he stares at her breasts).
45	Monica (to Ross)	 Okay, well, stop staring at them.
46	Ross	 She brought them up! (pause) I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
47	Erica	 Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
48	Monica	 Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
49	Ross	 Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
50	Monica	 Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
51	Erica	 Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
52	Ross	 Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
53	Monica	 Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
54	Erica (standing up)	 I'll be right back.
55	Ross	 Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
56	Monica	 Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
57	Ross	 No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
58	Monica	 Yeah, it takes two incomes.
59	Ross	 Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
60	Monica	 Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
61	Ross	 Mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
62	Monica	 Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
63		(Ross takes the tape roll she's handing him and walks to the guest room while mocking Monica's voice)
64		
65	[Scene	 Guest room. Joey has his head wrapped in bubbled wrap and Chandler is punching him. Ross enters the room.]
66	Ross	 What are you guys doing?
67	Joey	 Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross starts punching him too)
68	Monica (enters the room)	 Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
69	Chandler	 We're taking a break!
70	Monica	 From?
71	Chandler	 Jumping on the bed?
72	Monica	 All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
73	Ross	 You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
74	Chandler	 No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
75		(Joey takes the bubble wrap off his head)
76	Joey	 You guys hear a ringing?
77	Chandler	 (holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
78	Joey	 Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
79	Ross	 Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
80	Chandler	 I didn't know Monica had these!
81	Joey	 Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
82	Chandler	 Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
83	Ross	 Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
84		
85	[Scene	 Monica's apartment. Phoebe and Ross enter the room.]
86	Phoebe	 Hey!
87	Monica	 Hey! Where's Mike?
88	Phoebe	 Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
89	Ross	 Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
90	Phoebe	 Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
91	Ross	 Rock on!
92	Phoebe (watching the food on the table)	 Wow, this is quite a spread! (pause) What is all this stuff?
93	Monica	 Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy
94	Joey	 (entering the room) Hey.
95	Chandler	 Hey.
96	Ross	 Hey, where's Rach?
97	Joey	 Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
98	Ross	 Great.
99	Joey	 Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
100	Monica	 Yeah.
101		(Rachel enters the room)
102	Everybody	 Hey Rach, hey you.
103	Ross	 Here she is!
104	Rachel (crying)	 Hi you guys!
105	Joey	 What did I just say?
106	Rachel	 No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
107	Monica	 Come here, I'll make you a drink.
108	Ross	 Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
109	Chandler	 I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
110	Joey (to Ross)	 You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
111	Ross	 Yeah?
112	Joey	 Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute...
113	Chandler	 Yes, Joe?
114	Joey	 I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
115	Phoebe (to Rachel)	 You doing ok?
116	Rachel	 Well, I've been better.
117	Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.
118	Rachel	 You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
119	Phoebe	 Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
120	Rachel	 I'm gonna miss you so much.
121	Phoebe	 I know.
122	Rachel	 You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
123	Ross	 Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
124	Joey	 Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
125		
126	[Scene	 Guest room. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.]
127	Rachel	 Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
128	Phoebe	 Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you.
129	Rachel	 Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
130	Phoebe	 It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
131	Rachel	 I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
132		
133	[Scene	 Monica's apartment. The living room.]
134	Monica	 Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
135	Chandler	 Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
136	Monica	 What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
137	Chandler	 Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
138	Monica	 That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
139	Chandler	 Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
140	Monica	 Rachel used to live in that room.
141	Chandler	 Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
142	Monica	 Joey's bare ass!
143	Chandler	 (he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
144		(Phoebe and Rachel enter the living room.)
145	Rachel	 I love you Phoebe.
146	Phoebe	 I love you too. (they hug) Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! (they hug again)
147	Rachel	 All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
148	Phoebe	 Ok.
149	Rachel	 Ok. Monica?
150	Monica	 Yeah?
151	Rachel	 Can you come here with me for a minute?
152	Monica	 Sure.
153	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
154	Monica	 No.
155	Phoebe	 Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica goes into the guest room)
156	Ross	 (to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
157	Phoebe	 She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
158	Ross	 Are you kidding? Oh my God...
159	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
160	Ross	 Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
161		
162	[Scene	 The guest bedroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.]
163	Rachel	 Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
164	Monica	 I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
165	Rachel	 (starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
166	Monica	 (having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.
167	Rachel	 (says something that cannot be understood)
168	Monica	 What?
169	Rachel	 I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
170	Monica	 That is so sweet. (they hug)
171		
172	[Scene	 Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.]
173	Ross	 (to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
174	Chandler	 Uh, Rach?
175	Ross	 Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
176	Joey	 I really made you think about that thing uh?
177	Chandler	 (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
178	Rachel	 (laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
179	Chandler	 No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
180	Rachel	 Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
181	Chandler	 Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
182	Rachel	 Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
183	Chandler	 Pheebs!
184	Phoebe	 (from the other side of the room) Yeah!
185	Chandler	 I think these are yours.
186	Phoebe	 These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
187	Rachel	 (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
188	Chandler	 Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
189	Phoebe	 Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast)
190		
191	[Scene	 The guest bedroom. Chandler and Rachel.]
192	Rachel	 Oh honey...
193	Chandler	 Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
194	Rachel	 (all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
195	Chandler	 Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
196	Rachel	 Okay. Oh...
197		(Chandler blows raspberry again)
198	Rachel	 Oh!
199	Chandler	 I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
200		
201	[Scene	 Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.]
202	Monica	 (to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
203	Ross	 I don't think so.
204	Chandler	 Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
205	Monica	 You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
206	Chandler	 That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
207	Ross	 God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long?
208	Phoebe	 I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
209		(Rachel and Joey hug, and Rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. At that moment Joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.)
210	All	 No, no, no, no!
211		(Rachel rushes back and pulls Joey back onto the balcony, and takes him inside.)
212	Ross	 Okay, here we go...
213	Rachel	 Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...
214	Ross	 Yeah...
215	Rachel	 I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)
216	Ross	 Huh?
217	Rachel	 Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
218		(She leaves the apartment and they all stare at Ross)
219	Ross	 What? I don't get a goodbye?
220	Joey	 (still very emotional) Lucky bastard!
221		
222	[Scene	 Monica's apartment continued... Phoebe, Chandler, Monica and Joey are sitting down and Ross is pacing up and down.]
223	Ross	 Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
224	Monica	 Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
225	Ross	 Well, it needs to be plicit.
226	Joey	 All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
227	Ross	 No, I don't think so.
228	Phoebe	 You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
229	Monica	 Yeah. Mine too.
230	Chandler	 Mine was a humdinger
231	Ross	 (annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
232	Phoebe	 Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
233	Monica	 And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
234	Ross	 THE HELL I DO!
235		(Ross takes big steps leaving for Joey and Rachel's apartment, where Rachel is going through her papers.)
236	Ross	 I don't get a goodbye?
237	Rachel	 What?
238	Ross	 (talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
239	Rachel	 Ross...
240	Ross	 Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
241		
242	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. The others are still there.]
243	Monica	 I hope Ross isn't too upset.
244	Joey	 I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
245	Phoebe	 Tell me about it.
246	Chandler	 Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
247	Phoebe	 All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
248	Monica	 Uh, where do you think you're going?
249	Phoebe	 I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
250	Monica	 We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
251	Chandler	 Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
252	Joey	 Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
253	Monica	 Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
254	Chandler	 (to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
255	Monica	 Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
256	Phoebe and Joey	 Yeah.
257	Monica	 Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
258	Chandler	 Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
259	Monica	 You did? How?
260	Chandler	 Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
261	Monica	 Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
262	Joey	 Who's that dirty old lady?
263	Chandler	 Monica's grandmother.
264	Monica	 Nana liked it rough!
265		(Erica, the pregnant girl, enters)
266	Erica	 Hi!
267	All	 Hey!
268	Joey	 Come on here, have a seat.
269	Phoebe	 How was your night?
270	Erica	 Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
271	Monica	 Erica, are you okay?
272	Erica	 Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
273	Monica	 Oh my God!
274	Chandler	 Relax! We just get her some antacids.
275	Monica	 She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
276	Chandler	 Oh my God!
277	Phoebe	 Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
278	Monica	 All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)
279	Chandler	 Honey, it's gonna be okay.
280	Erica	 You can do this. Just breathe.
281	Monica	 Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
282	Erica	 (in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?
283	Monica	 Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
284		(there's a lot of supportive cheers from all. Erica, Monica and Chandler leave.)
285	Joey	 Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
286	Chandler	 What?
287	Joey	 If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
288		
289	[Scene	 Ross's apartment. Rachel bursts in.]
290	Rachel	 You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
291	Ross	 That's what it seemed like.
292	Rachel	 I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
293	Ross	 Fine, then why didn't you say something?
294	Rachel	 Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
295	Ross	 Rach!
296	Rachel	 What?
297	Ross	 You keep, you keep... You can't...
298	Rachel	 WHAT?
299		(Ross walks over to her and starts to kiss her passionately. After a while Rachel backs out. She thinks a while and starts kissing him back.)
300		
301		COMMERCIAL BREAK
302	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
303	Joey	 A little more.
304	Phoebe	 Okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)
305	Joey	 A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
306	Phoebe	 All right, ready?
307	Joey	 Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
308	Phoebe	 All right, here it goes...
309		(she knees him in the crotch. He jumps up a bit)
310	Joey	 (in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)
311		THE END
