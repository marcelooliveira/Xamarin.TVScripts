3	Joey	 (thinking) All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
4	Rachel	 (coming from her room) Hi, sweetie.
5	Joey	 (thinking) Hey, it’s your girlfriend, Rachel!
6		Opening Credits
7	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s, Chandler is sitting on the couch watching TV as Monica comes out of the bathroom.]
8	Monica	 (airily) Hi.
9	Chandler	 Are you, are you high?
10	Monica	 I just had the most amazing bath.
11	Chandler	 Really? I don’t like baths.
12	Monica	 Wait, you like them with me.
13	Chandler	 Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.
14	Monica	 Oh, baths are so relaxing!
15	Chandler	 Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
16	Monica	 How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
17	Chandler	 Honey, it’s 2
18	Joey	 (entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
19	Chandler	 Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
20	Joey	 Well, neither.
21	Chandler	 Oh my God, what’s up?!
22	Joey	 I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is… (Pause) You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! (Starts to leave)
23	Chandler	 Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.
24	Joey	 All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
25	Chandler	 Do you?
26	Joey	 It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
27	Chandler	 In London?
28	Joey	 Yeah.
29	Chandler	 Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
30	Joey	 You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
31	Chandler	 If that.
32	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch. Ross sits down.]
33	Rachel	 Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!
34	Ross	 Right.
35	Phoebe	 Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
36	Ross	 No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.
37	Rachel	 Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
38	Ross	 And smart!
39	Rachel	 Popular.
40	Ross	 With an aptitude for science.
41	Phoebe	 Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
42	Rachel	 Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!
43	Ross	 Really? Me too!
44	Phoebe	 Me too!
45	Rachel	 Really?!
46	Phoebe	 Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!
47	Ross	 Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)
48	Rachel	 Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.
49	Ross	 Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
50	Rachel	 Okay fine, what do you have?
51	Ross	 Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.
52	Rachel	 Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
53	Phoebe	 Yeah, by Sandrine.
54	Ross	 You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
55	Rachel	 I’m really, really not.
56	Phoebe	 How-how about you each get five vetoes?
57	Ross	 All right.
58	Rachel	 All right.
59	Ross	 That sounds fair.
60	Rachel	 Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.
61	Ross	 Veto.
62	Rachel	 Why?
63	Ross	 Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
64	Phoebe	 I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
65	Ross	 Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
66	Rachel	 Ross, why do you hate our child?
67	Ross	 Fine, you go.
68	Rachel	 Okay, James.
69	Ross	 Huh.
70	Rachel	 But only if it’s a girl.
71	Ross	 Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
72	Rachel	 Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
73	Ross	 Veto. Stewart?
74	Rachel	 Veto. Sawyer?
75	Ross	 Veto. Helen?
76	Rachel	 Veto.
77	Phoebe	 Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
78	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s, Monica comes from the bathroom as Chandler enters.]
79	Chandler	 Hey.
80	Monica	 Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
81	Chandler	 Sex on the balcony?
82	Monica	 No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?
83	Chandler	 What is it?
84	Monica	 I drew you a bath!
85	Chandler	 Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
86	Monica	 Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!
87	Chandler	 Well, this does butch it up a bit.
88	Monica	 I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
89	Chandler	 All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
90	Monica	 Absolutely.
91		(Chandler runs into the bathroom)
92	Monica	 Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.
93		[Cut to Chandler laying in the bathtub. "Only Time," is playing in the background.]
94	Chandler	 (thinking) All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.
95	Monica	 (entering) So?
96	Chandler	 Oh my God.
97	Monica	 I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
98	Chandler	 I’m going to need a bigger boat.
99	[Scene	 The Doctor’s Office, the doctor is writing something as Rachel is on the table, and Ross is standing.]
100	Ross	 I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
101	Rachel	 Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
102	Dr. Long	 Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
103	Ross	 Uh, no. No, we’re not.
104	Rachel	 But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
105	Dr. Long	 That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…
106	Ross	 No, no, we want to wait, right?
107	Rachel	 Right. Right.
108	Dr. Long	 (looks at her beeping pager) Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I know it’s really not my place, but please don’t name your child Phoebo.
109	Rachel	 (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
110	Ross	 What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.
111	Rachel	 Third one from the left?
112	Ross	 Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it. (Rachel starts to peek at the file) Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!
113	Rachel	 What?!
114	Ross	 You’re looking!
115	Rachel	 I didn’t!
116	Ross	 I saw you!
117	Rachel	 Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.
118	Ross	 Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
119	Rachel	 Okay, but Ross just listen to me…
120	Ross	 No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!
121	Rachel	 But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
122	Ross	 Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?
123	Rachel	 (holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
124	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica’s, Monica is entering.]
125	Monica	 Hello?
126	Chandler	 I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.
127	Monica	 You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.
128	Chandler	 I’m in the bathtub.
129	Monica	 Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?
130	Chandler	 I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
131	Monica	 What?
132	Chandler	 The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different. (Pause) It’s interesting.
133	Monica	 Okay, let’s talk about something else.
134	Chandler	 Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
135	Monica	 Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…
136	Chandler	 I had the exact same conversation.
137	Monica	 You did? What was he talking about?
138	Chandler	 I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
139	Monica	 (groans) That was a long night.
140	Chandler	 All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
141	Monica	 Okay, he was talking about rules.
142	Chandler	 Uh-huh.
143	Monica	 Umm, and looking at people differently.
144	Chandler	 He didn’t say anything about that to me.
145	Monica	 What did he tell you?
146	Chandler	 He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
147	Monica	 Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
148	Chandler	 But what did he mean by rules?
149	Monica	 Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
150	Chandler	 Because he was looking at her differently.
151	Monica	 And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
152	Chandler	 My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
153	Phoebe	 (from outside the bathroom) You guys?
154	Monica	 Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!
155	Chandler	 You don’t say anything.
156	Monica	 Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
157	Chandler	 I’m not going to let you say anything.
158	Monica	 You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)
159	Chandler	 Oh, God!
160		(Monica runs out to Phoebe, who is in the kitchen)
161	Phoebe	 Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
162	Monica	 Oh, you had that?
163	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
164	Monica	 I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
165	Phoebe	 Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
166		(Monica starts smiling)
167	Phoebe	 What?
168	Monica	 Nothing.
169	Phoebe	 Okay.
170	Monica	 I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.
171	Phoebe	 Fine.
172	Monica	 It’s a humdinger!
173	Phoebe	 Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
174	Monica	 Somebody likes you!
175	Phoebe	 (Groans) Is it Chandler?
176	Monica	 No!
177	Phoebe	 Well, then tell him to stop staring!
178	Monica	 It’s Joey!
179	Phoebe	 Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
180	Monica	 Is it something you’d be interested in?
181	Phoebe	 I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.
182	Monica	 I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?
183	Phoebe	 Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
184	Monica	 Not Chandler, just Joey.
185	Phoebe	 Sure.
186		Commercial Break
187	[Scene	 Central perk, Ross is sitting on the chair as Rachel walks in.]
188	Rachel	 Hey.
189	Ross	 Hey.
190	Rachel	 You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
191	Ross	 Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!
192	Rachel	 I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
193	Ross	 I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
194	Rachel	 I would—Sequoia?
195	Ross	 Veto.
196	Rachel	 Fine.
197	Ross	 Unless… (Rachel groans.) You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
198	Rachel	 But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
199	Ross	 Not like this!
200	[Scene	 Rachel and Joey’s, Joey is sitting on his recliner as Phoebe enters.]
201	Phoebe	 Hey.
202	Joey	 Hey. Well, what’s up?
203	Phoebe	 Umm, Joey, I know.
204	Joey	 What?
205	Phoebe	 I knooow.
206	Joey	 Whaaat?
207	Phoebe	 I know about your feelings.
208	Joey	 Oh my God. You do?
209	Phoebe	 Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.
210	Joey	 I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.
211	Phoebe	 For God sakes, it’s Rachel!
212	Joey	 I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!
213	Phoebe	 Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.
214	Joey	 What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?
215	Phoebe	 Yeah.
216	Joey	 She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
217	Phoebe	 Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
218	Joey	 You think?
219	Phoebe	 Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
220	Joey	 Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.
221	Phoebe	 That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.
222	Joey	 Not really.
223	Phoebe	 Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
224	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is on the couch as Ross enters.]
225	Ross	 So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
226	Rachel	 What?
227	Ross	 That’s right. The student has become the master.
228	Rachel	 Ross, I swear, I don’t know.
229	Ross	 Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!
230	Rachel	 A what?!
231	Ross	 You really didn’t know?
232	Rachel	 We’re having a girl?
233	Ross	 No.
234	Rachel	 That’s what you just said!
235	Ross	 No.
236	Rachel	 You said girl!
237	Ross	 Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
238	Rachel	 I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!
239	Ross	 I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!
240	Rachel	 Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…
241	Ross	 Permission to veto.
242	Rachel	 Yes, please.
243	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s, Chandler enters as Monica comes from the bathroom.]
244	Monica	 Hey.
245	Chandler	 Do I smell essential oils?
246	Monica	 Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.
247	Chandler	 Okay.
248		(As soon as Monica leaves the room, Chandler takes off his jacket and runs to the bathroom. Monica enters the bathroom to find Chandler in the bathtub.)
249	Monica	 What do you think you’re doing?
250	Chandler	 L-leaving my troubles behind?
251	Monica	 I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
252	Chandler	 Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
253	Monica	 Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!
254		(Phoebe enters the bathroom)
255	Chandler	 (upset) Hey!
256	Phoebe	 Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
257	Chandler	 (To Monica) You told her?!
258	Monica	 She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?
259	Phoebe	 Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!
260	Monica	 What?
261	Phoebe	 Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?
262	Monica	 (Pause) I don’t think I’d care.
263	Phoebe	 Really? Lee Majors is hot!
264	Joey	 (from outside the bathroom) Hello?
265	Phoebe	 We’re in the bathroom!
266	Joey	 Why?
267	Chandler	 (sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
268	Joey	 (entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?
269	Monica	 Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!
270	Chandler	 You like Rachel?!
271	Joey	 It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
272	Phoebe	 (checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.
273	Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)
274	Monica	 Honey, cover it up with the boat!
275	Ross	 (from outside the bathroom) Hello?
276	Chandler	 (sarcastically) Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
277	Ross	 (entering) Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh, cool boat—(Sees why the boat’s there)—Oh, no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel) Hey, did you, did you tell them?
278	Rachel	 No, I was waiting for you!
279	Phoebe	 Tell us what?
280	Rachel	 We’re having a girl.
281	All	 Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
282		(They all hug and then turn and look at Chandler)
283	Chandler	 I’ll…I’ll get you later!
284	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel’s, Joey is sitting at the counter eating Cocoa Puffs.]
285	Joey	 (thinking) All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.
286	Rachel	 (entering) Hi, sweetie.
287	Joey	 (thinking) I love you.
288		Closing Credits
289	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica’s bathroom. Both are sitting on opposite ends of the bathtub.]
290	Monica	 It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?
291	Chandler	 Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
292	Monica	 I’m not touching you.
293	Chandler	 You’re not?
294	Monica	 It’s the salts.
295	Chandler	 Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
296	Monica	 (To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
297		End
