3	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is in the kitchen as Joey enters from his bedroom.]
4		
5	Joey	 Morning, roomie!
6		
7	Rachel	 Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
8		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
9	Joey	 Fifth day's a charm.
10		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
11	Rachel	 Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
12		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
13	Joey	 Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
14		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
15		(Ross enters.)
16		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
17	Ross	 Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
18		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
19	Rachel	 Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
20		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
21	Joey	 She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
22		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
23	Rachel	 Bye!
24		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
25		(She leaves.)
26		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
27	Ross	 Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
28		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
29	Joey	 No, hey, it's been great.
30		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
31	Ross	 Yeah?
32		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
33	Joey	 Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
34		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
35	Ross	 Yeah, that'll do it.
36		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
37	Joey	 Wow! So, how are you?
38		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
39	Ross	 I'm, I'm okay.
40		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
41	Joey	 Really?
42		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
43	Ross	 Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
44		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
45	Joey	 Well, actually it...
46		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
47	Ross	 No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
48		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
49	Joey	 Wow, really?
50		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
51	Ross	 Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
52		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
53	Joey	 Sure, I know lots of girls.
54		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
55	Ross	 Yeah? Any names come to mind?
56		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
57	Joey	 Ooh, names?
58		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
59		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
60		Opening credits.
61		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
62		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
63	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters.]
64		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
65	Phoebe	 Hey.
66		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
67	Joey	 Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
68		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
69	Phoebe	 What you got?
70		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
71	Joey (checks the refrigerator)	 Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
72		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
73	Phoebe	 Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
74		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
75	Joey	 I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
76		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
77	Phoebe	 Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
78		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
79	Joey	 Why are they doing this?
80		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
81	Phoebe	 I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
82		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
83	Joey	 You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
84		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
85	Phoebe	 I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
86		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
87	Joey	 I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
88		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
89	Phoebe	 I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
90		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
91	Joey	 Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
92		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
93	Phoebe	 You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
94		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
95	Joey	 Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night
96		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
97	Phoebe	 So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
98		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
99	Joey	 I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
100		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
101	Phoebe	 Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
102		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
103	Joey	 Ooh, that's a great plan!
104		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
105	Phoebe	 Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A maniacal laugh follows.)
106		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
107		(They both start laughing really loudly.)
108		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
109	Joey	 Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
110		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
111		(He looks at his bedroom door, but he can't remember the name of the girl.)
112		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
113		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
114	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're in the kitchen as Rachel enters.]
115		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
116	Rachel	 Hey!
117		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
118	Monica	 Hey!
119		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
120	Rachel	 You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
121		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
122	Chandler	 See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
123		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
124	Rachel	 I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
125		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
126	Monica	 Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
127		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
128	Rachel	 Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
129		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
130	Monica	 Oh my god.
131		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
132	Chandler	 Wow.
133		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
134	Rachel	 Why? What's the big deal?
135		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
136	Monica	 Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
137		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
138	Rachel	 What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
139		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
140	Chandler	 Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
141		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
142	Monica	 You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
143		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
144	Rachel	 So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
145		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
146	Monica	 Oh, it's perfect.
147		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
148	Rachel	 Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
149		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
150	Chandler (reading the newspaper)	 Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
151		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
152		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
153	[Scene	 Central Perk. Joey is drinking coffee by the counter as Phoebe enters.]
154		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
155	Phoebe	 Ooh, Joey.
156		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
157	Joey	 Hey.
158		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
159	Phoebe	 Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
160		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
161	Joey	 All right! Who is he?
162		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
163	Phoebe	 Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
164		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
165	Joey (gives a thumbs up sign)	 Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
166		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
167	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah.
168		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
169		(They sit down on the couch.)
170		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
171	Joey	 She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
172		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
173	Phoebe	 A teacher?
174		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
175	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
176		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
177	Phoebe	 Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
178		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
179	Joey	 Oh my god, you're right!
180		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
181	Phoebe	 Yeah.
182		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
183	Joey	 She even reads for pleasure!
184		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
185	Phoebe	 How do you even know a woman like that?
186		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
187	Joey	 What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
188		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
189	Phoebe	 Joey.
190		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
191	Joey	 I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
192		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
193	Phoebe	 So now what do we do?
194		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
195	Joey	 Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
196		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
197	Phoebe	 What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
198		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
199	Joey	 Ooh...I hear that's bad.
200		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
201	Phoebe	 Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
202		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
203	Joey	 Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)
204		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
205	Phoebe	 It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
206		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
207		(They both start laughing again.)
208		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
209	Joey	 Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
210		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
211	Phoebe	 No, I think we killed it.
212		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
213		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
214	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Emma is there in her playpen, while Chandler is behind the couch.]
215		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
216	Chandler	 Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
217		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
218		(He does the ancient trick of going downstairs while behind the couch. As soon as he's out of sight, Emma starts crying.)
219		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
220	Chandler	 No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
221		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
222		(Monica enters from their bedroom with a calendar.)
223		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
224	Monica	 Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
225		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
226	Chandler	 I don't do that.
227		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
228		(Monica looks at him.)
229		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
230	Chandler	 I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
231		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
232	Monica	 Yeah.
233		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
234	Chandler	 Today is the sixth.
235		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
236	Monica	 No, it's not.
237		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
238		(Points at the calendar.)
239		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
240	Chandler	 Yes, it's also 2003.
241		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
242	Monica	 Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
243		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
244	Chandler	 It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
245		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
246	Monica	 Okay.
247		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
248		(She runs to the bathroom, while Chandler starts acting like a chicken in front of Emma. Emma is silent, however.)
249		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
250	Chandler	 Tough crib.
251		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
252	Monica	 Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
253		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
254	Chandler	 I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
255		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
256	Monica	 Chandler!
257		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
258	Chandler	 I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
259		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
260		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
261	[Scene	 Delmonico's restaurant. Ross is waiting for his blind date to show up. A waiter walks past him.]
262		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
263	Ross	 Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
264		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
265	Waiter	 Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
266		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
267	Ross	 Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
268		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
269	Waiter	 Can I get you another glass of wine?
270		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
271	Ross	 Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
272		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
273	Waiter	 Got stood up, huh?
274		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
275	Ross	 Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
276		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
277	Waiter	 Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
278		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
279	Ross	 No!
280		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
281		(The waiter leaves.)
282		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
283		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
284	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica emerges from the bathroom.]
285		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
286	Monica	 We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
287		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
288	Chandler	 Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
289		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
290	Monica	 So, let's do this.
291		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
292	Chandler	 I - I don't think I can.
293		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
294	Monica	 Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
295		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
296	Chandler	 Because of Emma.
297		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
298	Monica	 Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
299		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
300	Chandler	 Sorry.
301		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
302	Monica	 Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
303		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
304	Chandler	 Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
305		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
306	Monica	 Canoodling?
307		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
308	Chandler	 Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
309		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
310	Monica	 I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
311		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
312	Chandler	 Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
313		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
314	Monica	 I guess you're right.
315		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
316	Chandler	 You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
317		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
318	Monica	 But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
319		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
320		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
321	[Scene	 Another restaurant. Rachel is studying the menu together with her date, Steve. Steve is the stoned restaurateur from 115 TOW the Stoned Guy.]
322		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
323	Rachel	 Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
324		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
325	Steve (staring at Rachel)	 I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
326		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
327	Rachel	 Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
328		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
329	Steve	 I'm kind of funny looking.
330		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
331	Rachel	 What?
332		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
333	Steve	 Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
334		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
335	Rachel (feeling awkward)	 So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
336		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
337	Steve	 I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
338		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
339	Rachel	 Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
340		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
341	Steve	 I lost it. To drugs.
342		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
343		(Steve makes a face as if his mouth is too dry.)
344		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
345	Steve	 I silk-screen t-shirts now.
346		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
347	Rachel	 Really? What's that like?
348		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
349	Steve	 It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
350		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
351	Rachel (awkward chuckle)	 Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
352		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
353	Steve	 I do like my hair.
354		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
355	Rachel	 Really?
356		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
357		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
358	[Scene	 Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are there. Phoebe's cell phone rings.]
359		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
360	Phoebe	 Hello?
361		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
362		(Rachel is still at the restaurant, but Steve is gone.)
363		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
364	Rachel	 Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
365		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
366	Phoebe	 Hey, Rach!
367		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
368	Rachel	 This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
369		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
370	Phoebe	 You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
371		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
372	Rachel	 I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
373		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
374	Phoebe	 Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
375		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
376	Rachel	 He's not stoned.
377		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
378	Phoebe	 Did he go out for a cigarette?
379		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
380	Rachel	 Yeah, four times.
381		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
382	Phoebe	 My dear, sweet Rach.
383		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
384		(Rachel hangs up in disgust.)
385		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
386	Phoebe (to Joey)	 Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
387		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
388	Joey	 Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
389		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
390	Phoebe	 By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
391		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
392		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
393	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Emma has fallen asleep in her playpen, and Chandler has fallen asleep right next to her on the floor. He's even sucking on a pacifier.]

539		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

599	Ross	 But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
600		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
601	Rachel	 Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
602		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]

622	Phoebe	 How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?

640		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
641	Rachel	 Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
642		[if !supportEmptyParas] [endif]
643	Ross	 Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
