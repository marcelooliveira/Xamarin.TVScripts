3	[Scene	 Central Perk. Rachel is getting a cup of coffee as Joey and Phoebe enter and sit down.]
4	Phoebe	 Oh! Hey, Rach!
5	Rachel	 Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!
6	Phoebe	 Oh, you, too.
7	Joey	 Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?
8	Rachel	 It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.
9	Phoebe	 Okay.
10	Joey	 Bye.
11		(Rachel exits with coffee)
12	Joey	 There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
13	Phoebe	 (sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
14	Joey	 Thanks. But maybe later.
15	Phoebe	 Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
16	Gunther	 (to Joey) You want anything?
17	Joey	 You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!
18	Gunther	 We have red bagels.
19	Joey	 Oh, okay.
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s. Phoebe and Ross are sitting in the living room talking.]
22	Phoebe	 So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
23	Ross	 Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’
24	Phoebe	 Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.
25	Ross	 Uh, I’m going to take off.
26	Phoebe	 All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
27	Ross	 What is it?
28	Phoebe	 It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
29	Ross	 All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’
30	Phoebe	 Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
31	Monica	 (entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
32	Phoebe	 Oh, Monica, grow up!
33	Ross	 Hey, what’s behind your back?
34	Monica	 Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.
35	Ross	 You don’t want my opinion?
36	Monica	 Not really.
37	Ross	 Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!
38	Monica	 All right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles of clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
39	Ross	 (quietly) The red one.
40	[Scene	 Joey and…wait…just Joey’s. Joey is sitting at the counter eating a pizza.]
41	Phoebe	 (knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
42	Joey	 No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
43		(Phoebe goes into the hall and brings a dog inside!)
44	Phoebe	 He-hee!
45	Joey	 Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
46	Phoebe	 This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
47	Joey	 Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joey’s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.
48	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s. Chandler enters with a bouquet of roses.]
49	Chandler	 Happy Valentine’s!
50	Monica	 (from her bedroom) Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
51	Chandler	 (picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some "porn")
52		(A woman on TV breaths hard)
53	Man on TV	 Yeah, just relax.
54	Chandler	 I love you, St. Valentine.
55		(The woman groans, moans, grunts, and screams. Chandler’s eyes get huge!)
56	Chandler	 Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!
57	Man on TV	 Now, push!
58	Woman on TV	 Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
59	Chandler	 Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)
60	Woman on TV	 Ohhh! Make it stop!
61	Chandler	 I am trying!
62	[Scene	 Joey’s. Joey is playing fetch with the dog.]
63	Joey	 Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesn’t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you’re cute, but you’re not too smart!
64		(The dog returns with a ball that looks exactly like the same one Joey has.)
65	Joey	 (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?
66	Rachel	 (entering) Hi.
67	Joey	 Hi.
68	Rachel	 I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who is this?
69	Joey	 Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
70	Rachel	 (talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)
71	Joey	 (to the dog) C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.
72	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s. Chandler is sitting on the couch staring at the tape on the coffee table with his eyes huge and his mouth wide open.]
73	Monica	 (entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)
74		(Chandler glances up at Monica with his mouth still wide open and his eyes still huge)
75	Monica	 (to herself) I’ve still got it!
76	Chandler	 (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
77	Monica	 What is it?
78	Chandler	 It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…
79	Monica	 Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?
80	Chandler	 I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
81	Monica	 Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
82	Chandler	 Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
83	Monica	 Honey, what’s going on?
84	Chandler	 Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
85	Monica	 Mm-hmm.
86	Chandler	 How long it took to go back in the water?
87	Monica	 Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!
88	Chandler	 You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
89	Monica	 Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.
90	Chandler	 Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he’s going to throw up!)
91	Monica	 Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
92	Chandler	 See, honey, there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)
93	Monica	 Don’t touch me!
94	[Scene	 Central Perk. Ross is sitting on the couch reading a magazine as Mona enters.]
95	Mona	 Hi!
96	Ross	 Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?
97	Mona	 Good.
98	Ross	 Yeah?
99	Mona	 I brought you back a present.
100	Ross	 Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.
101	Mona	 I think it’s interesting.
102	Ross	 I do too! I missed you!
103	Mona	 I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
104	Ross	 Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
105	Mona	 How exciting!
106	Ross	 Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
107	Mona	 Oh no.
108	Ross	 Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
109	Mona	 (laughing) Yeah right!
110	Ross	 What?
111	Mona	 Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’ (she laughs again)
112	Ross	 (not amused) Huh…uh-huh.
113	Mona	 Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! (Mona laughs…yes…again!)
114		(Ross fake laughs, obviously not finding this funny, and he’s starting to panic, so he shoves the whole saltwater taffy he’s eating in his mouth)
115	Mona	 So, what’d you tell him?
116	Ross	 (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)
117		Commercial Break
118	[Scene	 Central Perk. Ross and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]
119	Phoebe	 How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
120	Ross	 I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
121	Phoebe	 Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.
122	Ross	 Ever?!
123	Phoebe	 Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?
124	Ross	 Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
125	Phoebe	 If I haven’t said it before
126	[Scene	 Joey’s. Joey is laying on his recliner, depressed, and the dog is laying on the footrest.]
127	Joey	 So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
128	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
129	Joey	 Hey.
130	Phoebe	 Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog? (the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?
131	Joey	 No.
132	Phoebe	 Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
133	Joey	 Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!
134		(Joey follows Phoebe into the kitchen)
135	Phoebe	 He’s miserable! What happened to him?
136	Joey	 Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
137	Phoebe	 What stuff?
138	Joey	 Rachel stuff.
139	Phoebe	 Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
140	Joey	 He’s breathing!
141	Phoebe	 Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.
142	Joey	 No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
143	[Scene	 Ross and…Rachel’s…I guess I have to call it that now. Rachel is reading on the couch as Ross enters.]
144	Ross	 Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
145	Rachel	 Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
146	Ross	 Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—
147	Rachel	 Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
148		(There is a knock on the door.)
149	Rachel	 Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)
150	Ross	 (opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!
151	Mona	 Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!
152	Ross	 (he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)Ayyyayyyy!
153	Rachel	 (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!
154	Mona	 Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! (to Ross) What’s she doing here?
155	Ross	 I have no idea!
156	Rachel	 I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
157	Mona	 Seriously, what is she doing?
158	Ross	 Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.
159	Mona	 Why?
160	Ross	 I think she’s lonely.
161	Mona	 Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!
162	Ross	 I know.
163	Mona	 Can’t we just ask her to go?
164	Ross	 No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
165		(Doorbell rings)
166	Rachel	 I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
167	Mona	 Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
168	Ross	 Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.
169	Rachel	 You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)
170	Ross	 And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.
171	Mona	 You got another ex-wife back there?
172	Ross	 (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
173	Rachel	 (entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.
174	Mona	 Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, but, um… what are you doing?
175	Rachel	 Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?
176	Mona	 No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
177	Rachel	 (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.
178	Ross	 (handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.
179	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch still staring at the screen.]
180	Monica	 How long has it been this time?
181	Chandler	 90 seconds.
182	Monica	 That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.
183	Chandler	 You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
184	Monica	 Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
185	Chandler	 I can do that.
186	Monica	 Okay.
187		(Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)
188	Chandler	 Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
189		(Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they can’t do it and back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone knocks on the door.)
190	Monica	 Oh, thank God!
191	Chandler	 Oh, I know!
192	Monica	 Come in!
193	Rachel	 (entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
194	Monica	 Oh, my God.
195	Chandler	 Poor Ross.
196		(Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the action in Ross’ apartment)
197	Chandler	 Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
198	Monica	 Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.
199	Chandler	 Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it
200	Rachel	 Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
201	Chandler	 Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
202	Rachel	 Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
203	Monica	 No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
204	Rachel	 C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!
205	Monica	 She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.
206	Chandler	 (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.
207	Rachel	 Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
208	Chandler	 Why have I seen this thing three times?!
209	Monica	 It’s…still beautiful.
210	Rachel	 Uh! It’s horrible!
211	Monica	 I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!
212	Rachel	 Oh, my God!
213		(Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes)
214	Chandler	 Wait, you guys, look!
215	Rachel	 What? Did her ass explode?!
216	Chandler	 No, the baby’s out! Look, look!
217	Monica	 Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
218	Chandler	 And look how happy the mom is now!
219	Monica	 Oh…Rach!
220	Rachel	 Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!
221	[Scene	 Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee as Joey comes from…God knows where! Some back area of Central Perk around the corner that we’ve never seen! Weeeiiirrrddd….]
222	Ross	 Hey, hey, man!
223	Joey	 Hey, what’s up?
224	Ross	 Uh…Mona just dumped me.
225	Joey	 Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?
226	Ross	 Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
227	Joey	 Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.
228	Ross	 Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?
229	Joey	 Sort of.
230	Ross	 Really?!
231	Joey	 You don’t have to seem so happy about it.
232	Ross	 Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
233	Joey	 Oh, I…I d—
234	Ross	 Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during sex.
235		(Two girls sitting at a table next to them look up in disgust, and Ross and Joey move away)
236	Ross	 Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
237	Joey	 Forget about it. It’s no big deal.
238	Ross	 C’mon! Joey! What is it?
239	Joey	 It’s nothing.
240	Ross	 Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?
241	Joey	 Okay, uh…sit down. (they do) Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.
242	Ross	 She’s not a Tribbiani?
243	Joey	 No!
244	Ross	 I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
245	Joey	 Yes.
246	Ross	 Well, uh, does she like you?
247	Joey	 Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.
248	Ross	 Why not?
249	Joey	 Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.
250	Ross	 So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?
251	Joey	 No. I don’t think so.
252	Ross	 Okay. Um… is he a good guy?
253	Joey	 Yeah, he’s the best.
254	Ross	 Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
255	Joey	 Oh, I don’t know.
256	Ross	 Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
257	Joey	 I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—
258	Ross	 Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
259	Gunther	 (placing a cup in front of Ross) Here’s your warm milk.
260	Ross	 I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
261	Joey	 Oh, yeah.
262	Ross	 Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)
263	Joey	 It’s Rachel.
264		(Ross just stands in the doorway, for like a minute…Ahh! What’s going to happen next??!!! I can’t make it all the way through the Olympics!!!)
265		Closing Credits
266	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel’s. Rachel is standing in front of the TV holding a video.]
267	Rachel	 (thinking) You’re going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)
268	Woman on TV	 I came to the big city to become a star! I’ll do…anything to make that happen!
269	Man on TV	 Anything?
270		(Music starts playing…yes…you know what kind of music…)
271	Rachel	 (thinking) Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
272		End
