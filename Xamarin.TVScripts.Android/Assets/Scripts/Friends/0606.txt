2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is balancing a mini hockey stick on his hand as Chandler enters from his room carrying a bunch of bills.]
3	Chandler	 (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
4	Joey	 Right! And when is that due?
5	Chandler	 First of the month.
6	Joey	 And that’s every month?
7	Chandler	 No, just the months you actually want to live here.
8	Joey	 Ahhh.
9	Chandler	 Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
10	Joey	 (looking at it) Oh my God!!
11	Chandler	 That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?
12	Joey	 No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
13	Chandler	 It’s not charity, Joe…
14	Joey	 No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.
15	Chandler	 Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
16	Joey	 This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
17	Chandler	 Uh, yeah.
18		(Joey runs over and shuts off the lights.)
19	Chandler	 So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about trying to give Joey some money.]
22	Phoebe	 So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
23	Chandler	 No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.
24	Phoebe	 Well, how much do you think he needs?
25	Chandler	 I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
26	Phoebe	 Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
27	Chandler	 Well that would help the pride thing.
28	Monica	 (entering from her room) Hey!
29	Chandler	 Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
30	Monica	 (thinks) Okay.
31	Chandler	 Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
32	Monica	 Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
33	Phoebe	 And also, my birthday.
34	Monica	 It’s not your birthday.
35	Phoebe	 What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!
36		(Joey and Ross enter.)
37	Joey	 Hey!
38	Ross	 Hey!
39	Chandler	 Hey!
40	Phoebe	 Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
41	Chandler	 Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.
42	Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
43	Joey	 I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
44	Ross	 I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
45	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering…
46	Monica	 You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
47	Rachel	 Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
48	Monica	 Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.
49	Rachel	 Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
50	Phoebe	 My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.
51		[Cut to Rachel’s bedroom, Phoebe and her are entering. And it’s obvious that she’s not packed.]
52	Phoebe	 Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.
53	Rachel	 Yeah, yeah, I know.
54	Phoebe	 Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.
55	Monica	 (entering) Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!
56	Rachel	 Surprise!!
57	Monica	 What?
58	Rachel	 No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
59	Monica	 (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?
60	Phoebe	 I have plans.
61	Monica	 You’re plans were with us.
62	Phoebe	 That’s right.
63	Monica	 All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
64	Phoebe	 Okay.
65	Monica	 Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!
66		[Cut to living room, Phoebe enters and closes Rachel’s door behind her.]
67	Phoebe	 Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)
68	Monica	 (entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…
69	Chandler	 Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
70	Monica	 I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
71	Chandler	 Yes, but for the last time.
72	Monica	 Okay fine, now Ross…
73	Ross	 Oh, but-but I can’t do it.
74	Monica	 Why not?
75	Joey	 (quietly) I’ve got Ben.
76	Ross	 Because, because I’ve got Ben.
77	Monica	 It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
78	Chandler	 He’s at a dinner party.
79	Monica	 Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
80	Ross	 Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
81	Monica	 All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel’s room.)
82	Ross	 (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
83	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is entering carrying two pizzas.]
84	Joey	 Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
85	Chandler	 Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
86	Joey	 Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
87		(Chandler stares at him, dumbfounded, then finally agrees.)
88	Chandler	 Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
89	Joey	 What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
90	Chandler	 Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
91	Joey	 Okay, you’re on.
92	Chandler	 Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
93		(They start playing.)
94	[Scene	 Rachel’s bedroom, she’s in her closet bringing down her pair of roller blades from a top shelf.]
95	Rachel	 Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.
96	Monica	 (starting to cry) Oh God!
97	Rachel	 You remember when we got these?
98	Monica	 No.
99	Rachel	 I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.)
100	Phoebe	 You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?
101	Rachel	 I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.
102	Monica	 I’m gonna miss you so much.
103	Phoebe	 Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.
104	Monica	 I don’t think there’s anything.
105	Phoebe	 Come on, there’s gotta be something.
106	Monica	 Nope, she’s perfect.
107	Rachel	 I have one.
108	Phoebe	 Good! Great! You can go first.
109	Rachel	 Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
110	Phoebe	 Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
111	Monica	 Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
112	Phoebe	 Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?
113	Monica	 Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
114	Rachel	 You get your messages!
115	Monica	 Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
116	Rachel	 So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
117	Phoebe	 Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
118	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, they are just finishing up another game of foosball.]
119	Joey	 (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.
120	Chandler	 Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
121	Joey	 You serious?
122	Chandler	 Oh yes!
123	Joey	 Okay, get ready to owe me!
124	Chandler	 Okay.
125	Joey	 Okay, here we go. Ready?
126		[In slow motion, as some haunty demonic music plays in the background, Joey throws the ball in, Chandler quits playing and goes for his Chinese food. Joey smacks the ball really hard, shooting it down the table. Chandler slowly takes a bite, the ball bounces off of the wall, heads back up the table, and scores the goal for Chandler.]
127	Chandler	 No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.
128		(In frustration, Joey kicks the table, breaking it.)
129	Chandler	 See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
130	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Monica answers it as Rachel and Phoebe move a box into the living room.]
131	Monica	 Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!
132	Rachel	 Ooh, your brother. Score!
133	Monica	 (on phone) What’s up?
134	Ross	 Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
135	Monica	 Oh, put him on!
136	Ross	 Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
137	[Scene	 Rachel’s bedroom, Rachel is entering carrying two glasses of wine. She gives one to Phoebe, keeps one, and completely ignores Monica.]
138	Phoebe	 Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
139	Rachel	 You know what else I’m not gonna miss? "I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
140	Monica	 "Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!"
141	Rachel	 "I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
142	Phoebe	 Hey! I call her!
143	Monica	 "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
144	Rachel	 "Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
145		(Monica picks up one of those boxes of hair curling things, dumps it in a box, and storms out.)
146	Phoebe	 Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
147		Commercial Break
148	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is examining the broken foosball table as Chandler enters from his room.]
149	Chandler	 Still broken?
150	Joey	 This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
151	Chandler	 Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
152	Joey	 Nah, not my game.
153	Chandler	 Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.
154	Joey	 Well, what’s it called?
155	Chandler	 Cups.
156	Joey	 I don’t know how to play Cups.
157	Chandler	 I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.
158	Joey	 All right.
159	Chandler	 Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?
160	Joey	 A two and a five.
161	Chandler	 Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
162	Joey	 Really?!
163	Chandler	 Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?
164	Joey	 A four and a nine.
165	Chandler	 You’re kidding right?
166	Joey	 No. Why?
167	Chandler	 Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)
168	Joey	 Damn! I am good at Cups!
169	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is whining to Phoebe about Rachel.]
170	Monica	 I’m not talking to her!
171	Phoebe	 Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
172	Monica	 Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!
173	Phoebe	 I know, I took it hard too.
174		(Monica goes into Rachel’s room.)
175	Monica	 Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)
176	Rachel	 I’m unpacking!
177	Monica	 What?!
178	Rachel	 I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that picture straight?
179	Monica	 It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
180	Rachel	 Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
181	Monica	 Because it’s my apartment!
182	Rachel	 Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
183	Monica	 How about, you’re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")
184	Rachel	 Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
185	Phoebe	 Hey, how are you guys doing?
186	Rachel	 Great! Monica’s moving!
187	Monica	 (entering) I am not!
188	Rachel	 Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
189	Phoebe	 Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.
190	Monica	 No Phoebe I am mad!
191	Phoebe	 Well, deep-deep-deep down!
192	Rachel	 Yeah, I’m just mad!
193	Phoebe	 Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
194	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, they’re still playing Cups.]
195	Chandler	 You win.
196	Joey	 Well, what did you have?
197	Chandler	 It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
198	Joey	 Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
199	Chandler	 Not 700 exactly?
200	Joey	 Yeah.
201	Chandler	 Double it! (He does.)
202	Joey	 What?
203	Chandler	 Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
204	Joey	 Really?
205	Chandler	 Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)
206	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica carries a box out of Rachel’s room.]
207	Monica	 Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
208	Rachel	 Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
209	Phoebe	 Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
210	Monica and Rachel	 What?!
211	Phoebe	 You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
212	Rachel	 Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
213	Monica	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
214	Rachel	 Oh really? Like what Monica?
215	Monica	 Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…
216	Rachel	 Oh yeah, good start Mon.
217	Monica	 She lets you borrow them.
218	Rachel	 Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
219	Monica	 Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (To Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
220	Phoebe	 What else?
221	Monica	 When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
222	Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
223	Phoebe	 That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
224	Monica	 When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
225	Rachel	 Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
226	Monica	 And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
227	Rachel	 Oh, it’s gonna be fine.
228	Phoebe	 Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!
229	Rachel	 But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
230	Phoebe	 Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
231	Monica	 Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!
232		[Cut to Ross’s apartment, he’s watching TV and eating some popcorn as the phone rings.]
233	Ross	 (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
234	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, (Ohh, that’s the last time I’m ever gonna type that line. It’s just so sad.) Joey is entering, angrily.]
235	Joey	 Hey!
236	Chandler	 What’s wrong?
237	Joey	 Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
238	Chandler	 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
239	Joey	 The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!
240	Chandler	 Oh man!!
241	Joey	 And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.
242	Chandler	 All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!
243	Joey	 No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
244	Chandler	 I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
245	Joey	 It’s him, not it!
246	Chandler	 No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
247	Joey	 Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!
248	Chandler	 When did I try to give you money?
249	Joey	 Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
250	Chandler	 I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
251	Joey	 I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.
252	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, (And that’s the last time for that line, no more Chandler and Joey’s or Monica and Rachel’s, ever!) Joey and Ross are carrying the last table of Rachel’s. Rachel follows slowly, but is stopped by Monica.]
253	Monica	 Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
254	Rachel	 Okay.
255	Monica	 I’m really gonna miss you.
256		(They hug.)
257	Rachel	 Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
258	Monica	 Thanks.
259	Rachel	 Yeah.
260		(Silence ensues.)
261	Rachel	 Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)
262	Monica	 Yeah.
263	Rachel	 Bye house!
264		(They break the embrace.)
265	Rachel	 Bye Mon.
266	Monica	 Bye.
267		(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel’s old and now empty room.)
268	Chandler	 (entering) Hey.
269	Monica	 She really left.
270	Chandler	 I know. (He kisses her.)
271	Monica	 Thank you.
272	Chandler	 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
273	Monica	 Can I ask you a question?
274	Chandler	 Sure!
275	Monica	 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
276		(And with that, an era ends as Chandler moves in with Monica as Rachel moves in with Phoebe. It ‘tis a sad and happy time for Friends.)
277		Ending Credits
278	[Scene	 Ross’s apartment, Chandler is trying to get Joey’s money back from Ross.]
279	Chandler	 I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
280	Ross	 And now you want that money back.
281	Chandler	 Exactly.
282	Ross	 Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)
283	Chandler	 It’s not a real game! I made it up!
284	Ross	 I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
285	Chandler	 At a fake game!!
286	Ross	 Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
287	Chandler	 Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
288	Ross	 No.
289	Chandler	 Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
290		End
