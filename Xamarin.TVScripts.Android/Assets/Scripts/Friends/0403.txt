2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in the canoe as Joey runs through the door carrying an outdoor patio table.]
3	Joey	 Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)
4	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!
5	Joey	 (Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!
6	Chandler	 Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
7	Joey	 Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
8		(They both sit down at the table and the chick and the duck enter from Joey’s bedroom.)
9	Chandler	 Could we be more white trash?
10		Opening Credits
11	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
12	Monica	 (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?
13	Rachel	 Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.
14	Monica	 I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.
15	Phoebe	 How come?
16	Monica	 Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
17	Ross	 Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.
18	Monica	 You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.
19	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is reading the paper and Chandler is getting ready for work.]
20	Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
21	Joey	 Just pickle.
22	Chandler	 Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
23	Rachel	 My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.
24	Chandler	 Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
25	Rachel	 (laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?
26	Chandler	 (laughs) No. No!
27	Joanna	 (Coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) Hello, Rachel. (She goes into Chandler’s bedroom)
28	Chandler	 Well, not at first.
29	Rachel	 What is she doing here?
30		(Joey makes a sound like a creaking bed.)
31	Rachel	 I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’
32	Chandler	 Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
33		(Joey creaks louder)
34	Rachel	 Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
35	Chandler	 Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.
36		(Joey makes a sound imitating one person making a bed creak and Chandler turns and glares at him.)
37	Rachel	 Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.
38	Chandler	 Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.
39	Rachel	 Thank you.
40	Chandler	 I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
41	Joey	 Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
42	[Scene	 The Geller household kitchen, Monica and Phoebe are cooking for Mrs. Geller’s party.]
43	Mrs. Geller	 (entering) How’s the hired help?
44	Monica	 Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
45	Mrs. Geller	 What’s this? Blue nail polish?
46	Monica	 Yeah, I thought it was cute.
47	Mrs. Geller	 Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her.
48	Monica	 Let me ask you a question.
49	Mrs. Geller	 Hmm.
50	Monica	 Why did you hire me?
51	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something. (Leaves)
52	Monica	 (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.
53	Phoebe	 Okay, I didn’t hear that.
54	Monica	 Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.
55	Phoebe	 Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives her a thumbs up)
56	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is scrapping gum off the table as there is a knock on the door. He goes over and opens it.]
57	The Salesman	 (Entering before Joey can say anything) Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
58	Joey	 Uhhhh. (He’s not sure)
59	The Salesman	 Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
60	Joey	 No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
61	The Salesman	 Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you’re not really sure what they’re talking about?
62		(We go into a flashback sequence with Joey remembering some of those times.)
63		[Cut to Monica and Rachel’s apartment, all are there.]
64	Ross	 …I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.
65	Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel	 Oh yeah, I totally agree.
66		(Joey just nods his head.)
67		[Cut to Central Perk, the entire gang is there.]
68	Monica	 …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod ‘Yes.’)
69	All	 Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)
70		[Cut to Monica and Rachel’s, they’re all there playing cards.]
71	Chandler	 …it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)
72		[Cut back to the present day.]
73	The Salesman	 (Interrupting the flashback) Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
74	Joey	 Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
75	[Scene	 The Geller’s Kitchen, Monica and Phoebe are still cooking.]
76	Phoebe	 That’s weird.
77	Monica	 What?
78	Phoebe	 Your nails.
79	Monica	 Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.
80	Phoebe	 Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.
81	Monica	 (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!
82	Phoebe	 Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.
83	Mrs. Geller	 (entering) (to Monica) Honey, don’t bite your nails.
84	Monica	 Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.
85	Phoebe	 And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
86	Mrs. Geller	 (laughs) I’m not freaking out.
87	Monica	 Then why are you laughing?
88	Mrs. Geller	 It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
89	Monica	 What? You bet I’d lose a nail?
90	Mrs. Geller	 Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d need these. (Opens the freezer to reveal…)
91	Monica	 Frozen lasagnas?
92	Mrs. Geller	 Um-hmm.
93	Monica	 You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…
94	Mrs. Geller	 No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
95	Monica	 You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.
96	Mrs. Geller	 Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself.
97	Monica	 (laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
98	Phoebe	 I don’t get it.
99	Mrs. Geller	 No, I have faith…
100	Monica	 (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.)
101	Oven	 Ding!
102	Phoebe	 Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
103	[Scene	 Joanna’s office, Joanna and Chandler are making out on her chair. Chandler isn’t wearing any pants.]
104	Chandler	 It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.
105	Joanna	 No, we are. I’m sad.
106	Chandler	 Okay.
107		(They start kissing again, but are interrupted by the phone.
108	Joanna	 (answering the phone) Yes. (listens) Uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow? (listens) All right. (hangs up) Unbelievable!!
109	Chandler	 Thanks.
110	Joanna	 No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
111	Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)
112	Joanna	 What are you doing?
113	Chandler	 I’m getting dressed.
114	Joanna	 Why?
115	Chandler	 When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
116	Joanna	 Wait. I wanna show you something.
117	Chandler	 What is it?
118	Joanna	 Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (She’s holding a pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.
119	Chandler	 Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.
120	Joanna	 (kisses him) I’ll be back in ten minutes. (Starts to leave)
121	Chandler	 You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?
122	Joanna	 Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.
123	Chandler	 Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!
124		[Cut to Joanna’s outer office, where Rachel and Sophie work. They are both coming back from lunch.]
125	Joanna	 (locking her door) Oh.
126	Sophie	 Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
127	Joanna	 Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose. (She grabs the cookie and walks out.)
128	Rachel	 That’s weird, she locked the door.
129	Sophie	 Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
130	Rachel	 Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?
131	Sophie	 Yeah!
132		(Rachel unlocks and opens the door to reveal a half-naked Chandler handcuffed to the chair. They both gasp and Chandler stares at them in shock and surprise.)
133	Chandler	 Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?
134		(Rachel and Sophie both back out and close the door without saying anything.
135		Commercial Break
136	[Scene	 Joanna’s office, Chandler, still handcuffed to the chair, is looking through the lingerie catalogue by turning the pages with his teeth. The phone rings and Chandler answers it with his nose.]
137	Chandler	 Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last name)…’s office.
138	Joanna	 (on speaker phone) I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
139	Chandler	 How little?!
140	Joanna	 A couple of hours, I feel awful.
141	Chandler	 Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!
142	Joanna	 I can’t!!
143	Chandler	 Why not?!
144	Joanna	 I’m in my boss’s car!
145	Chandler	 What?!
146	Joanna	 Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)
147		(Chandler gets an idea)
148		[Cut to Rachel’s office as her intercom buzzes.]
149	Rachel	 (answering it) (angrily) What?!
150	Chandler	 (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
151		(Rachel goes into talk to Chandler.)
152	Chandler	 Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
153	Rachel	 You promised you would break up with her!
154	Chandler	 I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
155	Rachel	 And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
156	Chandler	 It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
157	Rachel	 Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
158	Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna’s desk.)
159	Rachel	 Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!
160	Chandler	 Never!
161	Rachel	 You never come into this office again!
162	Chandler	 Fine!
163	Rachel	 You give me back my Walkman!
164	Chandler	 I—never borrowed your Walkman.
165	Rachel	 Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
166	Chandler	 You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)
167	Rachel	 Does it hurt?
168	Chandler	 No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!
169	Rachel	 Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
170	Chandler	 About what?
171	Rachel	 When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!
172	Chandler	 I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
173	Rachel	 No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)
174	Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!
175		(He starts to put his pants on, but Rachel manages to drag him to the chair. When they get to the chair, Chandler drops his pants and knocks the chair away. Rachel then backs him up and locks him to the top drawer of a filing cabinet.)
176	Chandler	 Well, this is much better.
177	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, The salesman is trying to sell Joey the encyclopedias.]
178	The Salesman	 So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
179	Joey	 He cut off his ear.
180	The Salesman	 And?
181	Joey	 I’m out.
182	The Salesman	 He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in the book)
183	Joey	 Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
184	The Salesman	 Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?
185	Joey	 In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.
186	The Salesman	 Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
187	Joey	 Spock’s birth control.
188	The Salesman	 (laughs) You need these books.
189	[Scene	 Monica’s childhood bedroom (which has been turned into a gym), Monica is lying on the treadmill as Phoebe enters.]
190	Phoebe	 Hey!
191	Monica	 Hi.
192	Phoebe	 This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.
193	Monica	 Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.
194	Phoebe	 Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
195	Monica	 Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.
196	Phoebe	 No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.
197	Monica	 What?
198	Phoebe	 Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change.
199	Monica	 (getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.
200		(She exits and Phoebe goes over and sits down at the machine that works your shoulders and tries to do one, which she does, easily.)
201	Phoebe	 Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)
202	[Scene	 Joanna’s office, Rachel and Chandler are having a little tug-of-war with his pants.]
203	Rachel	 Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.
204	Chandler	 Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
205	Rachel	 What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
206	Chandler	 It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww, disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.
207	Rachel	 Foot rubs for a month!
208	Chandler	 Freedom!
209	Rachel	 I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
210	Chandler	 Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)
211	Rachel	 Sophie sit!!
212		(She closes the door and puts his tie into his mouth as a gag.)
213	Rachel	 No! God, would you just calm down!
214		(Chandler screams a little bit, then realises that he can spit out his gag. He does so with a ‘Pouff!’)
215	Chandler	 I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)
216	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is now reading the ‘V’ book, with the salesman watching.]
217	Joey	 Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)
218	The Salesman	 So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
219	Joey	 Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.
220	The Salesman	 Well ah, what can you swing?
221	Joey	 How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
222	The Salesman	 You don’t have, anything?
223	Joey	 You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
224	The Salesman	 Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time. (Starts to leave)
225	Joey	 And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.
226	The Salesman	 For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
227	Joey	 Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
228	[Scene	 Joanna’s office, Rachel and Chandler are still negotiating.]
229	Rachel	 I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
230	Chandler	 No!
231	Rachel	 I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
232	Chandler	 With extra pulp?
233	Rachel	 (happily) Yeah!!
234	Chandler	 No!
235	Rachel	 D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!
236	Chandler	 You don’t have it.
237	Rachel	 I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
238	Chandler	 How do Monica and Phoebe know?
239	Rachel	 Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.
240	Chandler	 (intrigued) Go on.
241	Rachel	 I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.
242	Chandler	 And Milton Berle has a…
243	Rachel	 Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)
244	[Scene	 The Geller’s kitchen, Phoebe is bringing in some dirty dishes.]
245	Monica	 Well?
246	Phoebe	 They’re not even touching the lasagna!
247	Monica	 Really?!
248	Phoebe	 Oh, they love your casserole.
249	Monica	 Yes!!
250	Phoebe	 It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
251	Mrs. Geller	 (entering) Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
252	Monica	 And you?
253	Mrs. Geller	 I thought it was… quite tasty.
254	Monica	 So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…
255	Mrs. Geller	 (interrupting) A bitch?
256	Monica	 Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
257	Mrs. Geller	 Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
258	Monica	 Wow!
259	Phoebe	 Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head ‘No.’)
260	Mrs. Geller	 And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer. (She starts to bite her nails)
261	Monica	 That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.
262	[Scene	 Central Perk, all except Chandler, are there.]
263	Chandler	 (hello) Hello.
264	Joey, Rachel, and Ross	 Hey!
265	Monica	 (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)
266	Chandler	 (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)
267	Joey	 Wh-what’s going on?
268	Phoebe	 Oh.
269		(She motions for them to come closer, they lean in and she whispers what Rachel told her. The guys both lean back laughing.]
270	Joey	 No he doesn’t!
271	Chandler	 (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!
272	Rachel	 So did you break up with Joanna?
273	Chandler	 I think so.
274	Joey	 Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
275	Ross	 The volcano?
276	Joey	 Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
277	Rachel	 What?!
278	Joey	 Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
279	Monica	 Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
280	Joey	 Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
281	Monica	 Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)
282	All	 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
283	Phoebe	 Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
284	Ross	 With such a sad history.
285	Chandler	 Could there be more Kims?
286		(They all laugh and Joey joins them, not to be left out. When the laughing dies down, he has a depressed look on his face.)
287		Closing Credits
288	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Rachel is coming in for the day.]
289	Joanna	 (from her office) Who’s out there?
290	Rachel	 It’s me! Good morning!
291	Joanna	 Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
292	Rachel	 Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word!
293	Joanna	 I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
294	Rachel	 Oh, yeah! Yeah!
295		(She goes back and forth, not sure what to do first, put the bagel down or grab the key. She finally puts the bagel down and grabs the key and goes over to unlock Joanna.)
296	Joanna	 You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definately broken up this time.
297	Rachel	 Okay.
298		End
