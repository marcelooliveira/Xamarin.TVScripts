2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone has just finished Thanksgiving dinner and are groaning over their fullness.]
3	Rachel	 Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
4	Ross	 I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
5	Joey	 I need something sweet.
6	Phoebe	 Does anyone wanna watch TV?
7	All	 Yeah, sure.
8		(She starts pushing the power button on the remote, but it's not facing the TV so it doesn't work.)
9	Phoebe	 Monica your remote doesn't work.
10	Monica	 Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
11	Phoebe	 Oh. Aw, forget it.
12	Rachel	 Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
13	Joey	 Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
14	Monica	 That's very nice.
15	Chandler	 That's sweet, Joey.
16	Joey	 Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. (Note
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier. Joey is talking about the wonder that is the thong.]
19	Joey	 I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
20	Chandler	 Are you aware that you're still talking?
21	Monica	 Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
22	Ross	 Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
23	Phoebe	 Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
24	Ross	 I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
25	Chandler	 No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
26	Rachel	 Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
27	Ross	 Oh God, no.
28	Joey	 Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
29	Chandler	 It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
30		(And with that, we start a series of flashbacks to Thanksgiving's of years gone by.)
31		Thanksgiving 1978
32	[Scene	 The Bing household, Mr. and Mrs. Bing and Young Chandler are eating Thanksgiving dinner as a housekeeper serves them.]
33	Mrs. Bing	 Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
34	The Housekeeper	 More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)
35		Present Day
36	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
37	Ross	 You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
38	Phoebe	 I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
39	Chandler	 Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
40	Phoebe	 Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
41		Thanksgiving 1862
42	[Scene	 A Union battlefield hospital, Phoebe, in a past life, is tending to a wounded Union soldier. (By the way, for historical perspective, 1862 was the second year of the American Civil War.)]
43	Past Life Phoebe	 More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying—(She is cut off by an exploding shell just outside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping out like you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says…) Oh no.
44		Present Day
45	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
46	Ross	 In this life, Phoebe.
47	Phoebe	 Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
48	Joey	 Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
49	Phoebe	 Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
50	Rachel	 I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
51	Monica	 Oh, let's not tell this story.
52	All	 Oh, come on!
53	Phoebe	 Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
54	Rachel	 What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
55	Joey	 Hey, it's not like it sounds.
56	Chandler	 It's exactly like it sounds.
57		Thanksgiving 1992
58	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Phoebe is entering.]
59	Joey	 (muffled) Hello?
60	Phoebe	 (surprised) Hello?
61	Joey	 Phoebe?
62	Phoebe	 Joey? What's going on?
63	Joey	 Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
64	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
65	Joey	 I know! It's stuck!!!
66	Phoebe	 (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
67	Joey	 I put it on to scare Chandler!
68	Phoebe	 Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
69	Joey	 Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
70	Phoebe	 Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
71		(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck on Joey's head.)
72	Monica	 (entering) Hey!
73	Phoebe	 Hey!
74	Monica	 Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
75	Joey	 It's Joey.
76	Monica	 What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
77	Phoebe	 No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
78	Monica	 Well, get it off now!
79	Joey	 I can't! It-it's stuck!
80	Monica	 Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
81	Phoebe	 All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
82		(They all start thinking. Joey starts rubbing his chin, of course his chin is currently inside the turkey so he ends up rubbing the turkey. And I didn't do that joke one bit of justice. It's one of those you have to see it to get it jokes.)
83	Monica	 Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!
84	Joey	 Sorry! Sorry.
85		(They get into position to pull the turkey off.)
86	Monica	 Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
87		(They both pull but Joey slips out and starts to fall backwards just as Chandler enters, scaring him.)
88	Chandler	 Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
89	Joey	 (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
90	Chandler	 I'm over here big guy.
91	Joey	 (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!
92		Present Day
93	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
94	Chandler	 (laughing) You did look like an idiot.
95	Joey	 Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
96	Ross	 Yeah that's the same.
97	Monica	 That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
98	Phoebe	 Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
99	All	 Which one?
100	Monica	 Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
101	Chandler	 Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
102	Monica	 Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
103		Thanksgiving 1987
104	[Scene	 The Geller household, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner. The doorbell rings.]
105	Mrs. Geller	 Monica! I think Rachel's here!
106	Monica	 I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!
107	Big Nosed Rachel	 Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
108	Fat Monica	 Oh, why? Why? What happened?
109	Big Nosed Rachel	 Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over…
110	Fat Monica	 Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
111	Big Nosed Rachel	 Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets Monica's parents.) Hi!
112	Mr. Geller	 Hi Rachel!
113	Big Nosed Rachel	 Happy Thanksgiving!
114	Mrs. Geller	 You too sweethart!
115	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
116		(He brought home Chandler for Thanksgiving. Chandler is sporting the very popular Flock of Seagulls haircut. Yeah, it's another you have to see it to believe it kinda thing.)
117	Mr. Geller	 Oh my!
118	Ross	 Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
119	Fat Monica	 Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)
120	Ross	 Oh, this is Monica.
121	Fat Monica	 Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
122	Chandler	 (seeing her) Okay.
123	Mrs. Geller	 I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
124	Ross	 Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
125	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
126	Fat Monica	 Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
127	Chandler	 Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
128		(As she is drinking, Monica laughs and Chandler's joke and Diet Coke comes out of her nose.)
129	Fat Monica	 dammit! (Runs off.)
130		(Ross points out Rachel to Chandler and goes over to talk to her. Rachel is checking out her nose in her compact mirror.)
131	Ross	 So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
132	Big Nosed Rachel	 Oh! No, not really.
133	Ross	 Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
134		(Rachel wanders into the kitchen where Monica is making Chandler's dinner.)
135	Big Nosed Rachel	 Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
136	Fat Monica	 I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
137	Big Nosed Rachel	 Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
138	Ross	 Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
139	Fat Monica	 Call them mom and dad you loser!
140	Ross	 (in a high pitched voice) Monica!
141		[Time lapse, dinner has finished and Chandler is sitting on the couch eating some pie. Monica sits down beside him, and he gets pushed up a little by the wave she makes in the couch.]
142	Fat Monica	 Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
143	Chandler	 Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
144	Fat Monica	 Okay!
145		(He gets up and walks away as Rachel come running over all excited.)
146	Big Nosed Rachel	 Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
147	Fat Monica	 Oh that's so great!
148	Big Nosed Rachel	 I know!
149	Fat Monica	 Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
150	Big Nosed Rachel	 Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
151	Fat Monica	 I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
152	Big Nosed Rachel	 I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
153		[Cut to the kitchen, Ross and Chandler are doing the dishes.]
154	Ross	 So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
155	Chandler	 Emotional Knapsack?
156	Ross	 Yeah.
157	Chandler	 Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
158	Ross	 Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night.
159	Chandler	 Dude, don't do that too me!
160		(Monica enters behind them.)
161	Ross	 All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
162		(Monica suddenly gets very happy.)
163	Chandler	 No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
164	Ross	 Hey!
165		(Upon hearing this, Monica starts to break down and storms out. Only to be stopped by her parents.)
166	Mrs. Geller	 (holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
167	Fat Monica	 No. No, thank you!
168	Mr. Geller	 Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
169		Commercial Break
170	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, back to the present day.]
171	Chandler	 I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
172	Monica	 Well, I do.
173	Chandler	 I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
174	Phoebe	 Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
175	Ross	 I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
176	Chandler	 I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
177	Rachel	 Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
178	Monica	 Yes, it was!
179	Rachel	 No, it wasn't. It was actually the…
180	Monica	 (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
181	Phoebe	 Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
182	Chandler	 We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
183	Phoebe	 Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
184		Thanksgiving 1988
185	[Scene	 The Geller household kitchen, Mrs. Geller is cooking and Rachel, post nose job, is helping her.]
186	Mrs. Geller	 So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
187	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
188	Mr. Geller	 (entering) Hi Rachel.
189	Rachel	 Oh hi!
190	Mr. Geller	 Wow, love your new nose!
191	Mrs. Geller	 Jack.
192	Mr. Geller	 What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see? (He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)
193	Mrs. Geller	 I'll get it.
194	Rachel	 No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)
195		(She opens the door to reveal Chandler and Ross. Unfortunately, they seem to have their holidays mixed up. They think it's Halloween and they're going as Crockett and Tubbs from that legendary TV show of the late 80's, Miami Vice. God, we looked silly back then!)
196	Rachel	 Hey!
197	Ross	 Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!
198	Mr. Geller	 (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!
199	Chandler	 Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
200	Ross	 So uh, where's Monica?
201	Mrs. Geller	 She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
202		(Monica enters, but she forgot something. Oh, about 150 pounds. In other words, she lost weight, big time!)
203	Monica	 Hi, Chandler.
204	Chandler	 Oh my God!
205	Monica	 What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
206	Chandler	 You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
207	Ross	 Dude!
208	Chandler	 Sorry!
209	Mrs. Geller	 Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
210	Ross	 Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
211	Monica	 So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
212		(She heads for the kitchen and Chandler watches her leave and admires the view.)
213	Mr. Geller	 Dude!
214	Chandler	 Sorry.
215		(In the kitchen.)
216	Rachel	 (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
217	Monica	 Well it didn't!
218	Rachel	 What?!
219	Monica	 Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
220	Rachel	 Okay, that we may be able to do.
221	Monica	 How?
222	Rachel	 Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
223	Monica	 What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
224	Rachel	 Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
225	Monica	 Yeah.
226	Rachel	 Yeah.
227	Monica	 And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
228	Rachel	 Then, you will definitely get him back!
229	Monica	 Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
230	Rachel	 Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
231	Monica	 What do you mean?
232	Rachel	 Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
233	Monica	 (excited) I can do that!
234	Rachel	 Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)
235	Chandler	 Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
236	Monica	 Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
237	Chandler	 Okay.
238	Monica	 Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
239	Chandler	 Are you all right?
240	Monica	 Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
241	[Scene	 The hospital, Chandler has been rushed to the emergency room.]
242	The Doctor	 What do we got here?
243	The Paramedic	 Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
244		(They go through the doors into the trauma room, opening them by ramming the gurney through them, only Chandler's foot is hanging off the end and he screams in pain.)
245	Ross	 Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
246	The Doctor	 It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
247	Mr. Geller	 Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
248	The Doctor	 Did you bring the toe?
249	Monica	 Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)
250	The Doctor	 (opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and—(Stops suddenly.)
251	Monica	 What?! What is it?
252	The Doctor	 You brought a carrot.
253	Chandler	 What?
254	The Doctor	 This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
255	Rachel	 You brought a carrot?!
256	Mrs. Geller	 Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
257	Monica	 God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
258	The Doctor	 It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
259	Chandler	 Without my toe?! I need my toe!
260	Monica	 Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
261	Mr. Geller	 Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
262		Present Day
263	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is reacting to the story.]
264	Chandler	 That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
265	Monica	 I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
266	Chandler	 That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
267	Monica	 I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
268	Chandler	 Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)
269	Monica	 Chandler! (Follows him out.)
270	Ross	 (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
271	Joey	 You're a dork.
272		[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is standing in front of his door.]
273	Chandler	 I can't believe this.
274	Monica	 Chandler, I said I was sorry.
275	Chandler	 Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
276	Monica	 Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
277	Chandler	 Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
278	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is sitting on one of the chairs and the duck is running around him and quacking.]
279	Chandler	 Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I’m happy all the time!
280		(There's a knock on the door and Chandler gets up to answer it. He opens the door to reveal Monica with a turkey over her head.)
281	Chandler	 Nice try.
282	Monica	 Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
283	Chandler	 Look, Monica…
284	Monica	 Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
285	Chandler	 This is not going to work.
286	Monica	 I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
287	Chandler	 You are so great! I love you!
288		(Monica stops suddenly and turns around slowly.)
289	Monica	 What?
290	Chandler	 Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
291	Monica	 You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
292	Chandler	 No I didn't!
293	Monica	 Yes, you did!
294	Chandler	 No I didn't!
295	Monica	 You love me!
296	Chandler	 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
297		(Joey walks in and sees Monica. He freaks out and runs back into the hallway, screaming.)
298		Ending Credits
299		Thanksgiving 1915
300	[Scene	 The Western front during World War I, Phoebe, in yet another past life, is once again a nurse tending to yet another dying soldier. But this time she's doing it with a French accent.]
301	French Phoebe	 Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! (A shell explodes outside next to the tent and when the smoke clears, Phoebe still has her arm.) Whew! (Her arm falls off and starts pumping out blood.) This is getting ridiculous uh!
