3	Chandler	 Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
4	Monica	 You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to necklace of shells he’s wearing.)
5		(Joey and Phoebe burst forth from his apartment.)
6	Phoebe	 Hi!
7	Joey	 Hey! You’re back! (Hugs and kisses all around.)
8	Monica	 Hi sweetie!
9	Phoebe	 Come on in!
10		(They grab the luggage and drag it into Joey and Rachel’s forcing Monica and Chandler to follow.)
11	Phoebe	 So how was the honeymoon?
12	Monica	 Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
13	Phoebe	 That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
14	Monica	 No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
15	Chandler	 They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.
16	Monica	 Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
17	Chandler	 I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
18	Monica	 I know.
19	Joey	 A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to Phoebe), two people?
20	Monica	 This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
21	Phoebe	 Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
22	Chandler	 Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…
23	Joey	 Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
24	Chandler	 We really…didn’t get a chance to…
25	Phoebe	 You have got to be kidding me!
26	Monica	 We didn’t get anything for anyone.
27	Joey	 Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
28	Monica	 That you can have.
29		Opening Credits
30	{Transcriber’s Note	 Tradition was broken here as there were no commercials immediately after the opening credits, just more show.}
31	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Rachel are entering with the rest of the gang already inside.]
32	Rachel	 Hi!
33	All	 Hey!
34	Ross	 Hello!
35	Rachel	 Welcome home.
36	Ross	 So, how was the honeymoon?
37	Monica	 It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby!
38	Rachel	 Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
39	Monica	 Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)
40	Chandler	 Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
41	Monica	 All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
42	Phoebe	 Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.
43		(Rachel looks at Ross and gets his approval.)
44	Rachel	 Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
45	Joey	 You’re welcome buddy.
46	Ross	 (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
47	Rachel	 And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
48	Ross	 (laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
49	Rachel	 What is?
50	Ross	 The lie you just told.
51	Rachel	 That-that you came on to me?
52	Ross	 There’s the one!
53	Rachel	 But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.
54	Ross	 Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
55	Joey	 Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That’s right.
56	Rachel	 You know you kissed me first.
57	Ross	 What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
58	Rachel	 I was sending you signals?
59	Ross	 Yeah!
60	Rachel	 Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)
61	Ross	 Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
62	Rachel	 Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
63	Ross	 Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
64	Rachel	 No please, show me how I begged you!
65	Ross	 I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s an expression.
66		Commercial Break
67	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, time has lapsed, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are sitting at the kitchen table.]
68	Phoebe	 I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!
69	Joey	 Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
70	Chandler	 Y’know who has a great video camera?
71	Phoebe	 (nasally) Greg and Jenny?
72	Monica	 Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
73	Chandler	 Let’s call ‘em.
74	Joey	 Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
75		(Monica goes over and dials their number.)
76	Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?
77	Joey	 Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.
78	Monica	 (on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)
79	Chandler	 Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
80	Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It’s the deli again!
81	Joey	 All right! I’ll have a sandwich!
82	Monica	 (hangs up) I don’t think this number’s right!
83		(Joey and Phoebe laugh.)
84	Chandler	 What?
85	Phoebe	 You got fake numbered.
86	Monica	 What?! People don’t do that!
87	Joey	 Oh I think we do.
88	Monica	 They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
89	Chandler	 I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
90	Monica	 And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
91	Joey	 Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
92	Phoebe	 Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.
93	Ross	 (entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
94	Phoebe	 Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
95	Ross	 Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
96	Phoebe	 That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
97	Ross	 Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
98	Joey	 Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.
99	Ross	 About…about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn’t had sex in months?
100	Joey	 (laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about.
101		Six Weeks Earlier
102	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is reading a cereal box as Ross enters wearing the red sweater.]
103	Ross	 Hey!
104	Joey	 Hey.
105	Ross	 Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about.
106	Joey	 Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
107	Ross	 I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
108	Joey	 Whoa, for like months?
109	Ross	 Five to be lying, six.
110	Joey	 Six months? Whoa that’s rough.
111	Ross	 Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
112	Joey	 The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
113	Ross	 Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!
114	Joey	 Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty.
115	Ross	 Really? Well then tell it to me.
116	Joey	 Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
117	Ross	 (sarcastic) I’ll try to control myself.
118	Joey	 Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe…
119	Ross	 (laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
120	Joey	 Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
121	Ross	 (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
122	Joey	 I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…
123	Ross	 (intently listening) Why?
124	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, Ross is on his date with Kristen and they’re drinking wine.]
125	Kristen	 Umm, this is great wine.
126	Ross	 It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
127	Kristen	 Really?
128	Ross	 Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
129	Kristen	 I studied for a year in Barcelona. (Ross is stunned and worried.)
130	Ross	 Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…
131	Kristen	 I love hiking!
132	Ross	 (whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
133	Kristen	 I think its Tibidabo.
134	Ross	 Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
135	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the counter as Ross enters.]
136	Joey	 Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
137	Ross	 Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
138	Joey	 Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.
139	Ross	 No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.
140	Joey	 How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?
141	Ross	 I was backpacking across Western Europe.
142	Joey	 I’m not feeling it.
143	Ross	 I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…
144	Joey	 No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?
145	Ross	 It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
146	Joey	 Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.
147	Ross	 I’ll try that.
148	Joey	 All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?
149	Ross	 Thanks.
150	Joey	 Good luck.
151	Ross	 Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
152	Joey	 Yeah?
153	Ross	 Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
154	Joey	 (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
155		(Ross pours himself a glass of wine, hits record, and sits down in front of the camera.)
156	Ross	 Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
157	Rachel	 Oh Ross!
158	Ross	 Hi!
159	Rachel	 Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
160	Ross	 That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
161		(They sit down on the couch, which is in front of the still recording camera.)
162	Ross	 (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
163		(Pause)
164	Chandler	 Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)
165	Monica	 Yeah, definitely.
166	Ross	 What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
167	Joey	 Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!
168	Ross	 Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "You’ll show me right?") No!
169	Joey	 You’re right. (Mouths, "I know you’ll show me, right?)
170	Ross	 Joey! No!
171	Joey	 Loud and clear! (Mouths, "You’ll show me," and nods.)
172		(Ross storms out.)
173	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in the living room.]
174	Monica	 I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
175	Joey	 Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.
176	Monica	 Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.
177	Joey	 Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
178	Phoebe	 Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
179	Chandler	 I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.
180	Monica	 I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
181	Chandler	 I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
182	Monica	 (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)
183	Chandler	 Well maybe it was all of your questions.
184	Monica	 What about my questions?
185	Chandler	 The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
186	Monica	 Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?
187	Chandler	 (angrily) Was that another question?
188	Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?
189	Joey	 Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
190	Rachel	 Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
191	Ross	 Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
192	Rachel	 Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?
193	Monica	 Hell yeah!!!
194	Rachel	 I am not gonna show you this!
195	Phoebe	 No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
196	Ross	 Forget it, she’s destroying it.
197	Phoebe	 Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
198	Ross	 Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
199	Rachel	 I wanna see it.
200	Ross	 What?!
201	Rachel	 Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
202	Joey	 (confused) Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!
203	Ross	 I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
204	Rachel	 Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)
205	Ross	 Rachel, please…
206	Rachel	 Ah, a little preview!
207	Ross	 Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)
208		(They both sit down.)
209	Rachel	 Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)
210	Ross	 (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
211	Joey	 (To Phoebe) I’m so happy!
212		Commercial Break
213	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, the scene is continued from earlier.]
214	Rachel	 (on tape) Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
215	Rachel	 There I am.
216	Phoebe	 You’re gonna get pregnant.
217	Rachel	 (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…
218	Ross	 (on tape) You didn’t do it?
219	Rachel	 (on tape) I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
220		(Chandler is shocked and Rachel gets scared of Monica very quickly.)
221	Monica	 (taking Rachel’s hand) Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.
222	Rachel	 Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.
223	Monica	 I know.
224	Rachel	 (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…
225		(Rachel hits fast forward. Monica is completely shocked.)
226	Chandler	 Did you do it on our invitations?!
227	Ross	 (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
228	Chandler	 So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
229		(Rachel stops fast forwarding.)
230	Rachel	 (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
231	Ross	 (on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost…
232	Rachel	 (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?
233	Ross	 (on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
234	Rachel	 (on tape) Oh I wanted to.
235		(Ross and Rachel trade looks while watching the tape.)
236	Ross	 (on tape) So we…we both wanted to.
237	Rachel	 (on tape) Interesting.
238	Ross	 (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
239	Rachel	 (on tape) Oh yeah, sure.
240	Rachel	 Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.
241	Ross	 And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
242	Rachel	 (on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
243		(Joey’s shocked and everyone else looks at Rachel.)
244	Rachel	 Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!
245	Phoebe	 Oh, you came on to Ross!
246	Rachel	 What?!
247	Ross	 Now I’m so happy.
248	Rachel	 What are you talking about?!
249	Monica	 You used the Europe story!
250	Chandler	 That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
251	Rachel	 How do you know about that story?!
252	Joey	 How do you know about that story?!
253	Rachel	 I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
254	Joey	 (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)
255	Rachel	 No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
256	Joey	 (raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!
257	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is looking at the tape sitting on the counter as Ross enters.]
258	Ross	 Hi.
259	Rachel	 So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
260	Ross	 Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
261	Rachel	 It was an amazing night.
262	Ross	 It was. It was an amazing night.
263		(Pause)
264	Rachel	 You think it looked amazing?
265	Ross	 I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.
266	Rachel	 Yeah, me neither. Yet…
267	Ross	 Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
268	Rachel	 Yeah, it would be really weird.
269		(Ross grabs the tape and heads for the VCR as Rachel goes over and puts the chain on the door and locks it.)
270	Ross	 Good luck.
271	Rachel	 Good luck to you.
272		(Ross pushes play.)
273	Ross	 Mind if I mute?
274	Rachel	 Oh please. (He does so.)
275	Ross	 Oh, oh there go the clothes.
276	Rachel	 You are undressing very quickly.
277	Ross	 Six months Rachel, six months.
278	Ross and Rachel	 Ah. (Pause) Oh.
279	Ross	 Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.
280	Rachel	 That’s what I was gonna say.
281	Ross	 Oh nice tan!
282	Rachel	 Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
283	Ross	 Ah….
284	Rachel	 Have you been working out?
285	Ross	 I have been working out.
286	Rachel	 Really? Wow, this is so much better than I…
287	Ross and Rachel	 Ohh! Ew!
288	Ross	 Oh that’s not pretty.
289	Rachel	 Oh! Oh!
290	Ross	 No!
291	Rachel	 Oh God!
292	Ross	 Oh no!
293	Rachel	 Oh, make it stop!
294	Ross	 Oh no!!
295	Rachel	 Make it stop!!
296	Ross	 No!!
