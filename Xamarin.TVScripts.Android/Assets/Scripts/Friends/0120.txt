3	Chandler	 I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
4	Joey	 No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
5	Ross	 I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
6	Monica	 (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
7	Ross	 I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
8	Rachel	 Oh, that is so sick.
9	Chandler	 I feel violated. And not in a good way.
10	Phoebe	 How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
11		Opening Credits
12	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
13	Chandler	 I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
14	Monica	 So have you called her yet?
15	Chandler	 Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
16	Joey and Ross	 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
17	Monica	 I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
18	Phoebe	 Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
19	Chandler	 Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
20	Joey	 Her answer machine?
21	Chandler	 No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
22	Phoebe	 So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
23	Chandler	 Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
24	Monica	 Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
25	Ross	 Okay, okay, what's going on?
26	Phoebe	 Okay, they're just talking...
27	Ross	 Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
28	Phoebe	 No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
29	Ross	 What? What? What?!
30	Phoebe	 That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
31	Chandler	 (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
32	All	 Oh!... Right!
33	Chandler	 Hey Rach!
34	Monica	 How'd it go?
35	Rachel	 Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
36	Phoebe	 Not a good day for birds...
37	Rachel	 Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
38	Ross	 That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
39	Rachel	 Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
40	Ross	 That's, that's nice twice!
41	Monica	 Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
42	Joey	 Duh, where've you been?
43	Rachel	 Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
44		(Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)
45	Chandler	 Yes!
46	Rachel	 Why?
47	Chandler	 I have my reasons.
48	Monica	 Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
49	Rachel	 All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
50	[Scene	 Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.]
51	Rachel	 Wow... Wow!
52	Barry	 Yeah.
53	Rachel	 I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
54	Barry	 Nooo, it wasn't.
55	Rachel	 Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
56	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.]
57	Chandler	 (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
58	Monica	 That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
59	Chandler	 Hey, I've been honing!
60	Ross	 What was with the dishes?
61	Chandler	 Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
62	Monica	 (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
63	Phoebe	 Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!
64	Monica	 Great, now he's waving back.
65	Joey	 Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
66	Monica	 What kinda stuff?
67	Joey	 Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
68	Phoebe	 You cook naked?
69	Joey	 Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
70		(A pause as they look at Chandler.)
71	Chandler	 What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
72	[Scene	 Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.]
73	Barry	 What's the matter?
74	Rachel	 Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
75	Barry	 No, it was. It was very very good.
76	Rachel	 Well, what about Mindy?
77	Barry	 Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
78	Rachel	 No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
79	Barry	 Well, if you want, I'll justâ€”I'll just break it off with her.
80	Rachel	 No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
81	Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
82	Barry	 (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.
83	Rachel	 Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
84	Barry	 We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
85		(Pause as Rachel realises...)
86	Rachel	 I had a bra.
87		(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.)
88	Bobby	 Hey, Dr. Farber.
89		(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)
90	Barry	 All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
91		(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)
92	Rachel	 What?!
93	Bobby	 I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
94		(Rachel glares at him.)
95	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.]
96	Chandler	 Can I use your phone?
97	Monica	 Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
98		(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)
99	Chandler	 Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
100	Joey	 Maybe she never got your message.
101	Phoebe	 Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
102	Chandler	 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
103	Ross	 ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
104	Chandler	 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
105		(He calls and quickly hangs up.)
106	Phoebe	 How many beeps?
107	Chandler	 She answered.
108	Monica	 Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
109	Chandler	 I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
110		(Rachel enters.)
111	All	 Hey! Hi!
112	Phoebe	 How'd he take it?
113	Rachel	 Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
114	Monica	 (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
115	Rachel	 Oh, do I?
116	Monica	 Uh huh.
117	Rachel	 (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
118	Monica	 You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
119	Ross	 You-you had what?
120	Phoebe	 Sex in his chair.
121	Ross	 What, uh... what were you thinking?
122	Rachel	 I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
123	Ross	 No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
124	Rachel	 Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
125		(Ross flounders.)
126	Chandler	 If it helps, I could slide over.
127	Ross	 It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
128	Phoebe	 Where are you going?
129	Ross	 (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
130		(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)
131	Chandler	 Hello? Hello?
132		(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops. As she talks on the phone, an elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)
133	Rachel	 (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
134	Chandler	 So how's Mindy?
135	Rachel	 Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
136		Commercial Break
137	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning. Chandler is sitting and staring at his phone. Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler.]
138	Monica	 Brrrrrrr!
139		(Chandler clutches at his phone before realising.)
140	Chandler	 Hell is filled with people like you.
141	Joey	 (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
142		(Rachel enters from her room.)
143	Joey	 (ducking) Get down!
144	Rachel	 Get down?
145	Chandler	 ...And boogie!
146	Rachel	 Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
147	Monica	 Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
148	Rachel	 Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
149	Joey	 (intrigued) Yeah?
150	Rachel	 And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
151	Joey	 ..Naughty!
152	Rachel	 Right, I'll see you guys later...
153	Joey	 Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...
154		(Joey exits.)
155	Chandler	 Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
156	Monica	 Why don't you just take it with you?
157	Chandler	 Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
158	Monica	 Why don't you just call her?
159	Chandler	 I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
160	Monica	 Do you?
161	Chandler	 No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
162	Monica	 Don't you have to pee?
163	Chandler	 'S'why I'm dancing...
164	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters.]
165	Rachel	 Mindy.
166	Mindy	 Hey, you.
167	Rachel	 Hey, you.... So, what's up?
168	Mindy	 Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
169	Rachel	 Sure we should... So.
170	Mindy	 Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
171	Rachel	 Okay.
172	Mindy	 Will you be my maid of honour?
173	Rachel	 Of course!
174	Mindy	 Oh that's so great!
175	Rachel	 Was that all you wanted to ask me?
176	Mindy	 That's all!
177	Rachel	 Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
178	Mindy	 That's not all.
179	Rachel	 Oh sure it is!
180	Mindy	 Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
181	Rachel	 Um, what- what would make you think that?
182	Mindy	 Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
183	Rachel	 (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
184	Mindy	 Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
185	Rachel	 What? What's what you were afraid of?
186	Mindy	 Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
187	Rachel	 What?
188	Mindy	 I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
189	Rachel	 Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
190	Mindy	 What do you mean?
191	Rachel	 (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
192	Mindy	 Oh no.
193	Rachel	 Oh, I am so sorry.
194	Mindy	 No me, I am so sorry...
195		(They hug and Joey enters.)
196	Joey	 (watches them for a while) Oh my.
197	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking, and Chandler is still staring at his phone.]
198	Ross	 Four letters
199	Chandler	 Ring dammit, ring!
200	Ross	 Thanks.
201	Joey	 (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?
202	Chandler	 What?!
203	Joey	 I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
204	Chandler	 (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
205	Monica	 Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
206	Joey	 Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
207	Chandler	 Nngghhh!!!!!!!
208	Joey	 (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
209	Ross	 "Heating device."
210	Phoebe	 Radiator.
211	Ross	 Five letters.
212	Phoebe	 Rdtor.
213	Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney's a woman.
214	Monica	 So she's a woman! So what?
215	Joey	 Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel likeâ€”(Listens)â€”Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
216	Monica	 Joey!!
217	Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
218	Monica	 The green dress? Really?
219	Joey	 Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
220	Monica	 (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
221	[Scene	 Barry's Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters.]
222	Rachel	 Hey. Got a second?
223	Barry	 Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...
224	Mindy	 Hello, sweetheart.
225	Barry	 Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
226	Rachel	 Uh, we are here to break up with you.
227	Barry	 Both of you?
228	Mindy	 Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
229	Barry	 I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
230	Rachel	 Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
231	Barry	 ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
232	Rachel	 Even when we were having sex in that chair?
233	Barry	 (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
234	Rachel	 Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
235	Mindy	 (to Rachel) You did it twice?
236	Rachel	 Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
237	Mindy	 Okay...
238	Barry	 (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
239	Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
240	Barry	 Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
241		(Barry exits)
242	Rachel	 Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
243	Mindy	 Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
244	Rachel	 What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
245	Mindy	 Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
246	Rachel	 Oh God.
247	Mindy	 I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
248	Rachel	 And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
249	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]
250	Monica	 You okay?
251	Rachel	 Yeah.
252	Monica	 Really?
253	Rachel	 Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
254	Monica	 Aww... (They hug)
255		(Joey enters and looks on approvingly.)

263	Chandler	 Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
264	All	 Hi. Hi.
265	Chandler	 What are you doing here?
266	Danielle	 Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
267	Chandler	 ...I'm, I'm okay.
268	Danielle	 Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
269	Chandler	 That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
