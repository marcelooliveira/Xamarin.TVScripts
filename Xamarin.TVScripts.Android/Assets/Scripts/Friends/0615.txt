Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.}
3	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters.]
4	Rachel	 Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
5	Monica	 Oh my God!
6	Phoebe	 Wow!
7	Joey	 (To Ross) What is the matter with you?!
8	Phoebe	 No! Barry and Mindy.
9	Joey	 Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?
10	Rachel	 Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
11	Joey	 Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?
12	Rachel	 Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
13	Monica	 Why did they get divorced?
14	Rachel	 Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
15	Ross	 I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
16	Phoebe	 Which time?
17	Ross	 The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
18	Joey	 (starts to imagine it) I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.
19	Ross	 I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. (That’s karate, he’s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.
20	Chandler	 Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
21	Monica	 And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.
22	Chandler	 Sure I would!
23	All	 (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
24	Chandler	 What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?
25	Ross	 No, I just think Monica was that fat.
26	Joey	 Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!
27	Chandler	 What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.
28	Phoebe	 What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
29	Ross	 What?!
30	Rachel	 Merrill Lynch?
31	Phoebe	 Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
32	Rachel	 Well why didn’t you take the job?
33	Phoebe	 Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
34	Ross	 Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?
35		Opening Credits
36	{Transcriber’s note	 This is where the opening credits are, but they’re not the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel’s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they’re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn’t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.}
37	[Scene	 A newsstand, Ross is buying a magazine and gets in line behind a woman.]
38	Ross	 (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
39	Rachel	 (gasps) Rob Tillman!
40	Ross	 No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!
41	Rachel	 Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
42	Ross	 No, no-no, Ross Geller.
43	Rachel	 Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!
44	Ross	 Yeah. Right.
45	Rachel	 Wow! How are you?!
46	Ross	 Good-good, I’m-I’m married. (Shows her his ring.)
47	Rachel	 Ohh! Me too!
48	Ross	 Is-isn’t it the best?
49	Rachel	 Oh, it’s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So, umm how’s Monica?
50	Ross	 Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
51	Rachel	 Ohh, I would love too.
52	Ross	 Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!
53	Rachel	 Ohh! Okay!
54	Ross	 Come on! (They start to leave.)
55	Rachel	 Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?
56	Ross	 No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…
57	Rachel	 (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.
58	Ross	 (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
59	Rachel	 But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
60	Ross	 Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let’s go see Monica!
61	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Fat Monica, and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch. Monica’s boyfriend is getting up to get something. For future reference, for the rest of this episode Monica’s fat, I won’t be calling her Fat Monica throughout.]
62	Joey	 So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
63	Monica	 He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.
64	Monica's Boyfriend	 (returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to Monica and sits down.)
65	Monica	 Thanks.
66	Monica's Boyfriend	 Yeah. Y’know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it’s a seed.
67	Joey	 (not impressed) Wow!!
68	Monica's Boyfriend	 Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut?
69	Joey	 Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)
70	Chandler	 (entering, depressed) Hey.
71	Joey	 Hey.
72	Monica	 Oh no! What’s the matter?
73	Chandler	 Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
74	Monica's Boyfriend	 Y’know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
75	Monica	 Okay.
76	Monica's Boyfriend	 (kisses her) Okay.
77	Monica	 Bye.
78	Monica's Boyfriend	 Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)
79	Chandler	 Was his question what’s more boring than him?
80	Joey	 Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
81	Chandler	 Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
82	Joey	 Really?
83	Chandler	 Ehh.
84	Monica	 Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
85	Joey	 That’s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
86	Monica	 No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
87	Joey	 That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!
88	Chandler	 I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
89	Joey	 Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
90	Chandler	 Okay!
91	Joey	 All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!
92	Chandler	 All right!
93		(As Joey goes to the bathroom, Corporate Phoebe enters. She’s wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase.)
94	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
95	Monica	 Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
96	Phoebe	 What?
97	Monica	 Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
98	Phoebe	 Ohh that’s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
99		(She hangs up as Ross and Rachel enter.)
100	Ross	 Hey Mon!
101	Monica	 Hey!
102	Ross	 Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
103	Monica	 (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!
104	Rachel	 Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She’s not quite sure of that one.)
105	Monica	 You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
106	Ross	 And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
107	Chandler	 Hey.
108	Rachel	 Oh yeah.
109	Ross	 And that’s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
110	Phoebe	 Hi!
111	Monica	 Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?
112	Ross	 (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
113	Rachel	 Oh yeah. Right. So now, are—do you, do you still do music?
114	Ross	 Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…
115	Rachel	 (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
116	Monica	 Rach, he’s a friend of ours.
117	Rachel	 (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
118	Chandler	 Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
119	Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
120	Rachel	 He’s coming over! He’s coming over!
121	Monica	 (getting up) Joey!
122	Joey	 (holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)
123	Monica	 Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
124	Rachel	 (giggles and can’t look at him) Hi!
125	Joey	 (shaking Rachel’s hand) Hi!
126	Rachel	 (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
127	Joey	 Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.
128	Rachel	 Ah!
129	Joey	 (turning and whispering to Monica) She’s not crazy is she?
130	Monica	 No.
131	Joey	 (To Rachel) So uh, how you doin’?
132	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there. Phoebe’s cell phone rings and she goes through her little routine of lighting a cigarette before answering the phone.]
133	Phoebe	 Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who’s this? (Listens) Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
134	Joey	 (entering) Hey there you are!
135	Chandler	 Uh-oh, it’s my boss!
136	Joey	 All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)
137	Chandler	 (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
138	Monica	 (laughs) You realize what you are don’t you?
139	Chandler	 What?
140	Monica	 You’re his bitch.
141	Phoebe	 (yelling from Monica’s room) No-no!! No!!
142	Monica	 (panicked) Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
143	Phoebe	 No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
144	Chandler	 But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
145	Phoebe	 What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
146	Monica	 What?!
147	Phoebe	 (louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe.
148	Chandler	 Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
149	Phoebe	 Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
150	Monica	 Yes!!
151	Phoebe	 Then yes that is what I’m having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.)
152	Monica	 Oh my God!
153		Commercial Break
154	[Scene	 A hospital, Phoebe is recovering from her heart attack as Ross, Monica, and Chandler are there to comfort and support her.]
155	Ross	 Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.
156	Phoebe	 Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
157	Monica	 Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.
158	Chandler	 I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
159	Monica	 Let’s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)
160	Phoebe	 (To Ross) So what’s going on with you?
161	Ross	 Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
162	Phoebe	 Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
163	Ross	 Yeah.
164	Phoebe	 How long has it been since you had sex?
165	Ross	 Well, last weekend…
166	Phoebe	 Oh that’s not so bad.
167	Ross	 …will be two months…
168	Phoebe	 That is.
169	Ross	 …since I stopped trying.
170	Phoebe	 Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
171	Ross	 What-what do you mean?
172	Phoebe	 I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
173	Ross	 Oh.
174	Phoebe	 Y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys…
175	Ross	 Wow!
176	Phoebe	 Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
177	Ross	 Okay, I think I got it.
178	Phoebe	 Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.
179	[Scene	 A hospital hallway, Chandler is sitting on a gurney with his hands spread out behind his back. Then Monica comes and plops down on the gurney and one of his hands. Chandler immediately recoils in extreme pain.]
180	Monica	 Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?
181	Chandler	 Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I’m with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I’m lost and I can’t find food."
182	Joey	 (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
183	Monica	 Yeah! She’s right in there! (Points to Phoebe’s room.)
184	Joey	 Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
185	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, Joey is showing Rachel around the set.]
186	Joey	 All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
187	Rachel	 Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
188	Joey	 Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
189	Rachel	 Hey!
190	Joey	 All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
191	Rachel	 (laughs) Wow! Umm, y’know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn’t.
192	Joey	 Why? (In Drake’s voice.) Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
193	Rachel	 (awestruck, then not) Isn’t that a line from the show?!
194	Joey	 Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake’s voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
195	Rachel	 That’s a line from the show too!
196	Joey	 Okay, you watch too much TV.
197	Chandler	 (approaching) Here you go Joe, here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
198	Joey	 Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there’s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)
199	Chandler	 Yeah?
200	Joey	 I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?
201	Chandler	 I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
202	Joey	 Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
203	Rachel	 Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
204	Joey	 (To Chandler) Iced tea.
205	Chandler	 Okay, anything for you sir?
206	Joey	 (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?
207	Rachel	 (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.
208	Joey	 (To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?
209	Chandler	 It’s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
210	[Scene	 Ross and Carol's, Ross is trying to talk to Carol about what Phoebe told him.]
211	Ross	 So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
212	Carol	 Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
213	Ross	 Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
214	Carol	 What do you mean?
215	Ross	 Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…
216	Ben	 (entering) Dad!! (Runs and hugs him.)
217	Ross	 Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
218	Ben	 Yay! (Runs off.)
219	Ross	 Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?
220	Carol	 Like what?
221	Ross	 Well I don’t know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol’s shocked and obviously doesn’t like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn’t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
222	Carol	 (quickly) I love that idea!
223	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is eating breakfast as Chandler enters.]
224	Chandler	 Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
225	Monica	 Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
226	Chandler	 Aww.
227	Monica	 Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out…) My last Kit-Kat bar!
228		(Chandler tries to take it, but Monica won’t let go. He tugs harder, and she still doesn’t budge.)
229	Chandler	 You wanna share it?
230	Monica	 Okay!!
231	Joey	 (entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
232	Monica	 It’s not mayonnaise!!
233	Joey	 Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)
234	Chandler	 What’s this?
235	Joey	 Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
236	Chandler	 Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
237	Monica	 Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
238	Joey	 Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!
239	Chandler	 Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.
240	Joey	 Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
241	Chandler	 Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.
242	Joey	 Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!
243	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is there as Rachel enters.]
244	Rachel	 Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
245	Monica	 Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
246	Rachel	 Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
247	Monica	 Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?
248	Rachel	 Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
249	Monica	 Well, you’re not.
250	Rachel	 Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
251	Monica	 Yeah I can! (Laughs) And don’t think I don’t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)
252	Rachel	 Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right?
253	Monica	 (giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?
254	Rachel	 Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!
255	Monica	 Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
256	Guy All the Way in the Back	 Yeah, I heard it.
257	Monica	 It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.
258	Rachel	 Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!
259	Monica	 Y’know what? You are right?!
260	Rachel	 Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…
261	Monica	 Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!
262	Rachel	 Oh what do you know? Virgin!
263	[Scene	 The hospital, Ross and Monica are in Phoebe’s room. Phoebe is in the bathroom and Monica notices smoke coming out from underneath the door.]
264	Monica	 Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
265	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
266	Monica	 Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
267	Phoebe	 No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
268	Monica	 Put it out!!
269	Phoebe	 Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I’m so glad you’re here.
270	Ross	 Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
271	Phoebe	 Oh, give it to me.
272	Ross	 I got it!
273	Phoebe	 Give it!
274		(He does a kara-tay move to silence her, then answers the phone.)
275	Ross	 (on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can’t come to the phone right now. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
276	Phoebe	 Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
277	Ross	 J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
278	Phoebe	 Thank God.
279	Ross	 (To Monica) Yeah, she’s fired.
280	[Scene	 Rachel and Barry’s bedroom, Rachel is watching Days of Our Lives. Of course it’s a Dr. Drake Remoray scene. It’s set in a hospital room, and Dr. Wesley and a nurse are talking about a female patient with a bandage around her head.]
281	Nurse	 You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
282	Dr. Wesley	 Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
283		(He goes to turn off a machine. Suddenly, Dr. Drake Remoray appears at the door with two cops!)
284	Dr. Drake Remoray	 Not so fast Wesley! (Rachel does a silent clap.)
285	Dr. Wesley	 (with evil dripping off his tongue) Remoray!
286	Dr. Drake Remoray	 That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!
287	Rachel	 (very relived) Oh! Thank God!
288		[Cut back to the TV, the cops are leading Dr. Wesley out, and as they pass Remoray and Wesley exchange evil glances.]
289	Dr. Drake Remoray	 Hope! Hope!
290	Hope	 (sleepily) Drake!
291	Dr. Drake Remoray	 You’re not dying Hope, you’re gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.

294	Rachel	 Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joey’s phone number, and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
295		Commercial Break
296	{Transcriber’s Note	 This is where Part II begins, which means this is now episode 616.}
297	[Scene	 Ross and Carol's, Carol is working on something at the table and Ross is reading a newspaper on the couch.]
298	Ross	 So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…
299	Carol	 Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
300	Ross	 Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone’s been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
301	Carol	 Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so…
302	Ross	 Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…
303	Carol	 Oh, me too.
304	Ross	 Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.
305	Carol	 Oh umm, y’know I think it would be better if we just save it.
306	Ross	 Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
307	[Scene	 The hospital, Chandler and Monica are there with Phoebe as Ross enters.]
308	Ross	 Hey, Pheebs!
309	Phoebe	 Hey.
310	Ross	 Hey, how’s it going?
311	Phoebe	 Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
312	Monica	 (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.
313	Phoebe	 What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
314	Monica	 But, I put some honey in it.
315		(Phoebe mocks what Monica just said. Ross pulls Chandler aside.)
316	Ross	 She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?
317	Chandler	 No, the doctors say it may kill her.
318	Phoebe	 What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
319	Chandler	 (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
320	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
321	Phoebe	 Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)
322	Chandler	 Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
323	Phoebe	 I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?
324	Monica	 Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
325	Phoebe	 Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
326	Chandler	 Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
327	Phoebe	 Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
328	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, (The one he had when he was Dr. Drake Remoray, because he still is.) Rachel is there and admiring the big ceramic fake dog.]
329	Rachel	 Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!
330	Joey	 I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. You’ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.
331	Rachel	 Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
332	Joey	 (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?
333	Rachel	 Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!
334	Joey	 Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.
335	Rachel	 Umm, can I use your bathroom?
336	Joey	 It’s uh, right through there. (Points.)
337	Rachel	 Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…
338	Joey	 Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?
339	Rachel	 Yeah, it sure is!
340	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is pouring wine for her boyfriend, Dr. Roger.]
341	Monica	 I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?
342	Dr. Roger	 They have parasites?
343	Monica	 No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
344	Dr. Roger	 What people?
345	Monica	 People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)
346	Dr. Roger	 So oysters, huh?
347	Monica	 And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
348	Dr. Roger	 Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases…
349	Monica	 No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!
350	Dr. Roger	 Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay!
351	Monica	 Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!
352	Dr. Roger	 I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
353	Monica	 I can’t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)
354	[Scene	 Ross and Carol's, Ross and Carol are waiting anxiously for their new partner to arrive.]
355	Ross	 We’re really gonna do this, huh?
356	Carol	 Looks like it.
357	Ross	 Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
358	Carol	 (jumping up to get it) I got it!
359	Ross	 Okay.
360	Carol	 (opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who’d you think it was gonna be?)
361	Susan	 Hey! (They hug.)
362	Carol	 Thank you so much for coming.
363	Susan	 Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.
364		(They start moving towards the bedroom, never taking their eyes off each other. They move past Ross and stop.)
365	Ross	 I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
366	Susan	 (not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands it to him.) I love what you’ve done with this space.
367	Carol	 Thank you so much.
368		(They disappear into the bedroom leaving Ross standing in the living room holding Susan’s coat.)
369	Ross	 How hot is this?!
370	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are eating Monica’s dinner.]
371	Chandler	 I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.
372	Monica	 Yeah, me too.
373	Chandler	 Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.) "Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
374	Monica	 Stop it!! That’s not funny!!
375	Chandler	 Okay.
376	Monica	 I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
377	Chandler	 What was tonight?
378	Monica	 You don’t want to know what tonight was.
379	Chandler	 Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
380	Monica	 Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.
381	Chandler	 With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
382	Monica	 All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!
383	Chandler	 Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!
384	Monica	 How many?
385	Chandler	 Nine.
386	Monica	 I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
387	Chandler	 Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
388	Monica	 No. He’s not a horrible guy.
389	Chandler	 Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.
390	Monica	 Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!
391	Chandler	 No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
392	Monica	 Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
393	Chandler	 Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
394	Monica	 I was kidding.
395	Chandler	 So was I.
396	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Rachel is now three sheets to the wind and Joey is watching her.]
397	Rachel	 Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
398	Joey	 Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
399	Rachel	 Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
400	Joey	 Yeah you did.
401	Rachel	 Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)
402	Joey	 Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
403	Rachel	 Yeah?
404	Joey	 When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
405	Rachel	 Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.
406	Joey	 Come, come here.
407		(He takes her hands in his and kisses each one, then kisses her on the lips. When the break the kiss, Rachel starts to get nauseous and throw up. Joey backs away in horror.)
408	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, continued from earlier. Monica and Chandler are still discussing the previous question.]
409	Chandler	 We can’t do this.
410	Monica	 No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?
411	Chandler	 Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.
412	Monica	 Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?
413	Chandler	 I do like that.
414	Monica	 It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
415	Chandler	 Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
416	Monica	 Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)
417	Chandler	 Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!
418	Monica	 Noo!! Okay!!
419	Chandler	 Okay! (They both get up.)
420	Monica	 Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
421	Chandler	 I have some moves.
422	Monica	 I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (Giggles.) Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.
423	Chandler	 Yeah, let’s just forget it.
424	Monica	 What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)
425	Chandler	 Okay!
426		(She turns out the lights and in the darkened room Chandler starts to moan.)
427	Chandler	 Oh yeah.
428	Monica	 Chandler?
429	Chandler	 (sexily) Yeah?
430	Monica	 That’s the couch.
431		Commercial Break
432	[Scene	 Monica’s bedroom, she has just lost her flower to Chandler.]
433	Chandler	 Oh my God!
434	Monica	 I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
435	Chandler	 Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
436	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, the next morning, Rachel is passed out on the couch.]
437	Joey	 (entering) Morning!
438	Rachel	 (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.
439	Joey	 Yeah.
440	Rachel	 (groans) Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
441	Joey	 Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
442	Rachel	 Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…
443	Joey	 No! No! No, not after seeing that.
444	Rachel	 God I’m just a horrible person.
445	Joey	 Wh-why?
446	Rachel	 Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
447	Joey	 That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
448	Rachel	 Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.
449	Joey	 Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…
450	Rachel	 The ring from the cave, yeah.
451	Joey	 Wow! Uh okay, well uh… (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)
452	Rachel	 (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
453	Joey	 Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
454	Rachel	 No! No-no-no…
455	Joey	 Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.
456	Rachel	 But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
457	Joey	 Look, do you want the ring or not?!
458	Rachel	 Yeah!
459	[Scene	 Phoebe’s hospital room, Joey and Ross enter as Phoebe comes out of the bathroom wearing her robe.]
460	Ross	 Hey!
461	Joey	 Hey!
462	Ross	 Look at you! You’re up!
463	Joey	 All right!
464	Phoebe	 I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.
465	Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
466	Phoebe	 No. I’ve learned my lesson.
467		(She goes out into the hall and when she’s there and the door is closed; she rips off her robe to reveal her work clothes.)
468	Phoebe	 Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
469		[Cut back to her room, Joey and Ross are sitting there waiting for her.]
470	Ross	 Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?
471	Joey	 (not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I….
472	Ross	 No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.
473	Joey	 You?
474	Ross	 Yeah!
475	Joey	 Wow!
476	Ross	 Yeah!
477	Joey	 All right! So, was it amazing?
478	Ross	 It was, it was okay.
479	Joey	 Just okay—Did you do it right?!
480	Ross	 Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?"
481	Joey	 Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?
482	Ross	 Oh-oh, absolutely!
483		(They both laugh.)
484	Ross	 It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
485	Joey	 But you got to be with both of them, right?
486	Ross	 Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
487	Joey	 Not the other one?
488	Ross	 No, she kept kicking me away!
489	Joey	 Yeah, you don’t want that.
490	Ross	 No!
491	Joey	 Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
492	Ross	 Oh I a lot of stuff!
493	Joey	 You got a little bored?
494	Ross	 A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
495	Joey	 Yeah? What did ya have?
496	Ross	 Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…
497	Joey	 Sounds good.
498	Ross	 It really was!
499	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is making a sandwich as Chandler enters.]
500	Chandler	 Hey!
501	Monica	 Hey!
502	Chandler	 Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
503	Monica	 Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!
504	Chandler	 So you uh, want to do something tonight?
505	Monica	 Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
506	Chandler	 Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when… (He fakes falling asleep.)
507	Monica	 Are you okay?
508	Chandler	 Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
509	Monica	 Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
510	Chandler	 I bet he can.
511	Monica	 Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure you’re okay?
512	Chandler	 Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)
513	[Scene	 Rachel and Barry’s bedroom, Rachel is returning from her disastrous attempt at an affair to find that Barry was much, much more successful with his.]
514	Rachel	 Ohh! My God! Barry!!

516	Rachel	 Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!

522	Phoebe	 Uh, I don’t think so!
523	Jack	 Phoebe?
524	Phoebe	 Jack!! Hey!
525	Jack	 What are you doing here?
526	Phoebe	 All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
527	Jack	 Well, you were fired.
528	Phoebe	 Nu-uh!
529	Jack	 I told that guy who answered your phone.
530	Phoebe	 Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.
531	Jack	 Uh, Phoebe you-you don’t have an office.
532	Phoebe	 That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
533	Jack	 (approaches her) Phoebe, listen…
534	Phoebe	 You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…
535	Jack	 You lost 13 million dollars.
536	Phoebe	 Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
537	Jack	 Are you all right?
538	Phoebe	 I’m having another heart attack!
539	Jack	 What?!
540	Phoebe	 I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
541	Jack	 Take it easy. (Sits her down.)
542	Phoebe	 (to Arthur, he’s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!
543	Woman	 Hey Pheebs! How’s it going?!
544	Phoebe	 Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.
545	Woman	 Wow! Well, welcome back!

554	Rachel	 Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!
555	Ross	 Yeah.
556	Rachel	 Sit down!
557	Ross	 Okay. (He does so.)
558	Rachel	 Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
559	Ross	 We’re sorry.
560	Rachel	 No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
561	Ross	 Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
562	Rachel	 Aw what are you?! A detective?
563	Ross	 Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
564	Rachel	 Oh. (Doesn’t believe it.)
565	Ross	 Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
566	Rachel	 Who are these men?
567	Ross	 Men. I guy I know.
568	Rachel	 Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.
569	Ross	 She is not… (Realizes) She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
570	Rachel	 Good day for married people huh?
571	Ross	 I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
572	Rachel	 I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.
573	Ross	 Try telling my wife that.
574	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is blowing out a candle as Chandler enters.]
575	Chandler	 (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
576	Monica	 Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
577	Chandler	 Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
578	Monica	 What?!
579	Chandler	 I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)
580	Monica	 Why would you do that?
581	Chandler	 Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.
582	Monica	 Really?
583	Chandler	 Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.
584	Monica	 Chandler!
585	Chandler	 I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a "doctor…"
586		(Monica runs over and kisses him.)
587	Monica	 There was just one woman, wasn’t there?
588	Chandler	 No, there were two.
589	Monica	 Including me?
590	Chandler	 Oh yeah.

593	Phoebe	 (singing)
594		It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see… One of them won’t do it, but the second one will set you free… Tell all your hate and anger, it’s time to say good-bye… And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die! La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la……
