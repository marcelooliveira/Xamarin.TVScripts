2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is sitting on the chair, and they’re all talking.]
3	Rachel	 Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
4	Joey	 Probably Monica and Chandler.
5		(A woman walks up to Gunther in the background.)
6	Woman	 (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
7	Gunther	 Oh umm, uh we don’t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street. (Points.)
8	Woman	 That’d be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.)
9	Rachel	 (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.
10	Melissa	 (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)
11	Rachel	 (screaming) Melissa!
12	Melissa	 You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?!
13	Rachel	 Wh—(Turns and looks at the gang who’s staring)—Why don’t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)
14	Melissa	 So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel’s hand and notices that she doesn’t have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.
15	Rachel	 Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
16	Melissa	 Shut up!
17	Rachel	 I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
18	Melissa	 Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
19	Rachel	 Oh please…
20	Melissa	 (excitedly) Are you?!
21	Rachel	 No.
22	Melissa	 Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
23	Rachel	 Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…
24	Melissa	 You do now. You’re having dinner with me.
25	Rachel	 Shut up.
26	Melissa	 I-I’ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so listen, just call me. Here’s my card. (Hands the card over.)
27	Rachel	 Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!
28	Melissa	 Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
29	Rachel	 Wow! What do you do now?
30	Melissa	 (quietly) I’m a party planner. I’ll see you tomorrow. (Exits.)
31	Rachel	 Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
32	Joey	 Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!
33	Rachel	 Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college.
34	Ross	 She seems really, really fun!
35	Rachel	 She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
36	Monica	 Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…
37	Joey	 (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
38	Rachel	 (To Monica) Yes.
39	Monica	 Wow!
40	Joey	 (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!
41	Rachel	 It’s not a big deal!
42	Monica	 (To Joey) They were lovers.
43	Ross	 What?!
44	Joey	 What?!
45	Rachel	 No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.
46	Ross	 So that’s two of my wives.
47		Opening Credits
48	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is working on the seating chart while Chandler looks on and Rachel reads.]
49	Monica	 (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay, so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have people’s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel’s place.)
50	Rachel	 Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?
51	Monica	 (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
52	Chandler	 This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
53	Monica	 Chandler, relax it’s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a close one.
54	Joey	 (entering) Hello!
55	Rachel	 Hey!
56	Joey	 Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)
57	Rachel	 Stop picturing it!!
58	Monica	 Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?
59	Joey	 Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
60	Monica	 Oh! (Gets up) Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away) you’re parents will be at home in Queens.
61	Joey	 What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!
62	Monica	 Why would they think they’re invited?
63	Joey	 (looking around) You got me. I don’t…
64	Monica	 Joey!
65	Joey	 Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!
66	Monica	 Ross’s parents are my parents!
67	Joey	 Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!
68	Chandler	 Y’know I think we should invite them.
69	Monica	 Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
70	Chandler	 Well this is just sad!
71	Monica	 All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
72	Rachel	 That is not a problem.
73	Joey	 (leaning down to her) Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?
74	Rachel	 Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)
75	[Scene	 Ralph Lauren, Rachel is showing Chandler the selection of tuxedos.]
76	Rachel	 (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
77	Chandler	 Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
78	Rachel	 I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!
79	Chandler	 (sees another rack) Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.
80	Rachel	 Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.
81	Chandler	 You mean like for award shows?
82	Rachel	 Some of them.
83	Chandler	 You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
84	Rachel	 Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
85	Chandler	 Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
86	Rachel	 Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
87	Chandler	 Not bad.
88	Rachel	 (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.
89	Chandler	 Who’s that?
90	Rachel	 He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
91	Chandler	 Pierce Brosnan?
92	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
93	Chandler	 Are you serious?
94	Rachel	 Yeah.
95	Chandler	 007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
96	Rachel	 Yeah.
97	Chandler	 Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!
98	Rachel	 It’s a pretty cool tux.
99	Chandler	 Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
100	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are moving chess pieces around on the board and hitting the timer at random.]
101	Joey	 We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
102	Phoebe	 I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like in Checkers.) Chess!
103	Joey	 Nice move.
104	Phoebe	 Yeah.
105	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
106	Joey	 Hey!
107	Phoebe	 Hey!
108	Rachel	 So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding
109	Joey	 No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.
110	Rachel	 Well, what are you going to wear?
111	Joey	 Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
112	Rachel	 Huh. Does Monica know about this?
113	Joey	 I don’t think so.
114	Rachel	 Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
115	Phoebe	 Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
116	Rachel	 Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
117	Joey	 (excitedly) Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.
118	Phoebe	 What is this? What’s going on?
119	Joey	 Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
120	Rachel	 Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?
121	Phoebe	 Joey’s!
122	Joey	 Okay…
123	Rachel	 Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.
124	Phoebe	 (laughs) Yeah, I’m sure that happened.
125	Rachel	 It-it did!
126	Phoebe	 Sure!
127	Joey	 Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!
128	Rachel	 Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
129	Phoebe	 (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
130	Joey	 Why are you taking this away from me?
131	Rachel	 Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
132	Phoebe	 Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
133	Rachel	 I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!
134	Phoebe	 Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.
135	Rachel	 (shocked) Vanilla?!
136	Phoebe	 Yeah.
137	Rachel	 I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
138	Phoebe	 To Ross.
139	Rachel	 All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
140	Phoebe	 Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.
141	Joey	 Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
142	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch reading as Ross enters carrying a garment bag.]
143	Ross	 Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
144	Chandler	 A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
145	Ross	 No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!
146	Chandler	 What?
147	Ross	 That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
148	Chandler	 You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
149	Ross	 So?
150	Chandler	 So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
151	Ross	 Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
152		(Chandler mimics him.)
153	Chandler	 Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
154	Ross	 Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
155	Chandler	 Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
156	Ross	 When I got married you slept with my sister.
157	Chandler	 That was pretty 007.
158	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still working on the seating chart as Joey enters.]
159	Joey	 Hey.
160	Monica	 Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
161	Joey	 Yeah, they’re not coming.
162	Monica	 (looking at him) What?!
163	Joey	 Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.
164	Monica	 Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.
165	Joey	 Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…
166	Monica	 Oh Joey!
167	Joey	 Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
168	Monica	 No she hasn’t.
169	Joey	 Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?
170	Monica	 Well, what am I going to say?
171	Joey	 I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)
172	Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What, are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)
173	[Scene	 A restaurant, Melissa, Rachel, and Phoebe are talking.]
174	Melissa	 …anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
175	Rachel	 Oh. Oh, that’s great!
176	Melissa	 Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
177	Phoebe	 Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
178	Melissa	 What one?
179	Phoebe	 Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
180	Melissa	 Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? (Phoebe agrees by grunting.)
181	Rachel	 (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
182	Melissa	 (shocked) What?
183	Rachel	 Remember?! We—come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
184	Melissa	 Yeah?
185	Rachel	 …we went back to the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
186	Melissa	 Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about.
187	Phoebe	 Really?!
188		Commercial Break
189	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch as Chandler disgustedly enters.]
190	Chandler	 Ross is Batman!
191	Monica	 Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
192	Chandler	 Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
193	Monica	 What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
194	Chandler	 Batman has a utility belt!
195	Monica	 007 has a fancy car!
196	Chandler	 Batman has the Batmobile!
197	Monica	 007 gets all the ladies.
198	Chandler	 Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
199	Monica	 How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.
200	Chandler	 Actually, I don’t like martinis.
201	Monica	 How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
202	Chandler	 Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
203	Joey	 (entering) Hey.
204	Monica	 Hey.
205	Joey	 Listen, I know the invitation says 6
206	Monica	 The show?!
207	Joey	 Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
208	Monica	 Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
209	Joey	 Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!
210	Monica	 The wedding starts at six.
211	Joey	 Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?
212	Monica	 You’ll vamp?!
213	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no-one better! There is no-one greater!
214	[Scene	 The restaurant, continued from earlier.]
215	Rachel	 How can you not remember us kissing?!
216	Melissa	 I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened.
217	Rachel	 Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?
218	Phoebe	 Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.
219	Rachel	 Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.
220	Melissa	 I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
221	Rachel	 No!!
222	Phoebe	 Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
223	Rachel	 Thank you Phoebe.
224	Melissa	 She didn’t.
225	Phoebe	 I know.
226	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as Ross enters carrying his tux around.]
227	Ross	 Hey!
228	Monica	 You just carry that around?
229	Ross	 Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
230	Monica	 Between you and…
231	Ross	 Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
232	Chandler	 I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
233	Monica	 A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
234	Ross	 Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
235	Chandler	 Well, does that mean that you’re not going to be wearing yours?
236	Ross	 What, are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!
237	Chandler	 (standing up) Let me try it on!
238	Ross	 Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
239	Chandler	 (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What’s this?
240	Ross	 What?
241	Chandler	 An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
242	Ross	 Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
243	Chandler	 The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
244	Joey	 (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
245	Monica	 All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the altar and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!
246	Joey	 No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
247	Monica	 (defeated) Oh.
248	Chandler	 Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.
249	Joey	 Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.
250	[Scene	 Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.]
251	Rachel	 It happened! I am telling you it happened!
252	Melissa	 Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don’t think I’ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y’know you’ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.
253		(She’s about to get in when…)
254	Rachel	 What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
255	Melissa	 My God! You love me!
256	Rachel	 (shocked) What?
257	Melissa	 Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin’ together I… (Phoebe is shocked.) I just didn’t want to tell you ‘cause I didn’t think that you’d return my love, and now that you have… (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)
258	Rachel	 (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
259	Melissa	 Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)
260	Rachel	 (moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!
261	Melissa	 (suddenly frightened) Shut up!
262	Rachel	 I’m sorry!
263	Melissa	 (laughs) Oh you don’t have to be (Laughs again) sorry. I’m…I’m obviously kidding. I’m not in love with you. (To Phoebe) I’m not in love with her. I don’t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don’t…picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh…kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and drives off.)
264	Rachel	 Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…
265		(Suddenly, Phoebe leans in and kisses her on the lips!)
266	Rachel	 What the hell was that?!
267	Phoebe	 I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
268	Rachel	 And?
269	Phoebe	 I’ve had better.
270		Ending Credits
271	[Scene	 Ralph Lauren, Rachel is hooking Chandler up with another tuxedo.]
272	Chandler	 (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
273	Rachel	 Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!
274	Chandler	 Whose is it?
275	Rachel	 Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
276	Chandler	 Whose is it?
277	Rachel	 I don’t want to say.
278	Chandler	 Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?
279	Rachel	 Diane Keaton.
