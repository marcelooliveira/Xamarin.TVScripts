3	Monica	 What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
4	Joey	 Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
5	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah!
6	Rachel	 Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
7	Monica	 Absolutely.
8	Chandler	 Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
9	Ross	 Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
10	Chandler	 The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
11	Rachel	 Yeah, well, word of advice
12	Joey	 (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
13		Opening Credits
14	[Scene	 Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.]
15	Ross	 No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
16	Marsha	 Well, she has issues.
17	Ross	 Does she.
18	Marsha	 He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
19	Ross	 Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
20	Marsha	 Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
21		(Carol, Ross's ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.)
22	Ross	 (trying to ignore her) No. No.
23	Marsha	 Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
24	Ross	 Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
25		(Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.)
26	Ross	Hi.
27	Carol	 So.
28	Ross	 You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
29	Carol	 Sorry. You look good too.
30	Ross	 Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
31	Carol	 A lesbian?
32	Ross	 Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
33	Carol	 Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
34	Ross	 Why- why are you here, Carol?
35	Carol	 I'm pregnant.
36	Ross	 Pregnant?!
37	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching Three's Company.]
38	Chandler	 Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
39	Phoebe	...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
40	Monica	 (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
41	Joey	 Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
42	Monica	 Whose little ball of paper is this?!
43	Chandler	 Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
44		(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)
45	Phoebe	 She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
46	Monica	 Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
47	Chandler	 Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
48	Phoebe	 Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
49	Joey	 Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
50	Monica	 That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
51	Chandler	 (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
52	Monica	 What?
53	Chandler	 Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
54	All	 Eeaagh!
55		(Rachel enters from her room.)
56	Rachel	 Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
57	Phoebe	 Yeah, it's beautiful.
58	Rachel	 Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)
59	Phoebe	 No, look, don't touch that!
60	Rachel	 Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
61	Monica	 Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
62	Chandler and Joey	 Oh! Yeah!
63	Joey	 Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
64	Phoebe	 Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
65	Chandler	 You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
66	Rachel	 I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
67	Chandler	 ...Dinah?
68	Rachel	 (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
69	Monica	 You didn't.
70	Rachel	 Oh, I am sorry...
71	Monica	 I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
72	Rachel	 Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
73	Chandler	 Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
74	Monica	 (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
75	Chandler	 Boys? We're going in.
76		(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there's a knock on the door which Monica answers.)
77	Ross	 (standing outside the door).....Hi.
78	Monica	 Wow. That is not a happy hi.
79	Ross	 Carol's pregnant.
80	Phoebe	 (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
81	Monica	 W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
82	Ross	 Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)
83	Chandler	 Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
84	Rachel	 Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
85	Ross	 Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
86	Phoebe	 She is so great! I miss her.
87	Monica	 What does she mean by 'involved'?
88	Chandler	 I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
89	Ross	 Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
90	Rachel	 So what are you gonna do?
91	Ross	 I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
92		(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)
93	Joey	 .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
94		[Scene, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their parents.]
95	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?
96	Monica	 Curry.
97	Mrs. Geller	 Mmmm!
98	Ross	 I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
99	Mr. Geller	 (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
100	Mrs. Geller	 They all had a thing for him.
101	Ross	 Aw, Mom...
102	Monica	 I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
103	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
104	Monica	 No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
105	Mrs. Geller	 Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)
106	Monica	 Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
107	Ross	 Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)
108	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
109	Monica	 I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
110		[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]
111	Mrs. Geller	 What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
112	Mr. Geller	 I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
113	Mrs. Geller	 Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
114	Monica	 What's that supposed to mean?
115	Mrs. Geller	 Nothing! It's an expression.
116	Monica	 No it's not.
117	Mr. Geller	 Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
118		[Time Lapse.]
119	Mr. Geller	 Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
120		[Time Lapse.]
121	Mr. Geller	 ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
122	Monica	 (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
123	Ross	 (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
124		(Stunned silence ensues.)
125	Mrs. Geller	 (To Monica) And you knew about this?!
126		Commercial Break
127	[Scene	 Central Park, everyone's there.]
128	Joey	 Your folks are really that bad, huh?
129	Ross	 Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
130	Monica	 Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
131	Ross	 Must pee. (Goes to pee.)
132	Phoebe	 Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
133	Rachel	 You're twins?
134	Phoebe	 Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
135	Chandler	 What does she do?
136	Phoebe	 She's a waitress.
137	Rachel	 All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)
138	Monica	 Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
139	Chandler	 Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
140	Rachel	 The lights, please..
141		(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up. Ross enters from the bathroom.)
142	Ross	 ...How long was I in there?
143	Rachel	 I'm just cleaning up.
144	Ross	 D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
145	Rachel	 Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)
146	Ross	 Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
147	Rachel	 Oh.. a little..
148	Ross	 Mm-hmm..
149	Rachel	 A lot.
150	Ross	 Mm.
151	Rachel	 So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
152	Ross	 Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
153	Rachel	 Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
154	Ross	 Got me.
155	Rachel	 Remember when we were in high school together?
156	Ross	 Yeah.
157	Rachel	 I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?
158	Ross	 Yes, yes!
159	Rachel	 Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)
160	Ross	 Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)
161	[Scene	 Carol's OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.]
162	Ross	 (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
163		(Susan enters holding a drink.)
164	Susan	 Hi.
165	Carol	 Ross, you remember Susan.
166	Ross	 How could I forget?
167	Susan	 Ross.
168	Ross	 (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
169	Carol	 Dr. Oberman.
170	Ross	 ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
171	Susan	 She.
172	Ross	 -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
173	Carol	 Yes, and she's very supportive.
174	Ross	 Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.
175	Carol	 Thanks.
176	Ross	 (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..
177	Carol	 Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)
178		[Scene Barry's office, Barry is working on patient, Robbie, as Rachel enters.]
179	Rachel	 Barry?
180	Barry	 C'mon in.
181	Rachel	 (hesitates) Are you sure?
182	Barry	 Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
183	Robbie	 Huh?!
184	Barry	 So, how ya doin?
185	Rachel	 I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
186	Barry	 Yeah, well..
187	Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
188	Barry	 (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.
189		(As Barry exits Robbie stares at Rachel.)
190	Rachel	 I dumped him.
191	Robbie	 Okay.
192	[Scene	 Carol's OB/GYN, they're talking about how this is going to work.]
193	Ross	 So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
194	Carol	 Give me a 'for instance'.
195	Ross	 Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
196	Carol	 Marlon-
197	Ross	 Marlon?!
198	Carol	 -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
199	Ross	 ...As in Mouse?
200	Carol	 As in my grandmother.
201	Ross	 Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
202	Carol	 Julia..
203	Susan	 We agreed on Minnie.
204	Ross	 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
205	[Scene	 Barry's office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry's lamp as Barry enters.]
206	Barry	 Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
207	Rachel	 Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
208	Barry	 Oh, that's great.
209	Rachel	 Why are- why are you so tanned?
210	Barry	 Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
211	Rachel	 Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
212	Barry	 No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
213	Robbie	 Me?!
214	Barry	 No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.
215	Rachel	 Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
216	Barry	 Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
217	Rachel	 Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!
218	Barry	 Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
219	Rachel	 And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
220	Barry	 Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
221	Rachel	 Okay..
222	Barry	 See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
223	Rachel	 Wow.
224	Barry	 You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
225	Rachel	 What?
226	Robbie	 Me. (Spits.)
227	Rachel	 Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
228	Barry	 Well, thank you for giving it back.
229		(Barry and Rachel look at each other.)
230	Robbie	 Hello?!
231	[Scene	 Carol's OB/GYN, they're still arguing about what to name the baby.]
232	Susan	 Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
233	Ross	 Helen Geller? I don't think so.
234	Carol	 Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
235	Ross	 Thank you!
236	Carol	 No, I mean it's not Geller.
237	Ross	 What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
238	Carol	 No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
239	Ross	 Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
240	Susan	 It's my baby too.
241	Ross	 Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
242	Susan	 Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
243	Carol	 All right, you two, stop it!
244	Ross	 No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
245	Carol	 Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
246	Ross	 Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
247	Susan	 Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
248	Ross	 My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
249	Dr. Oberman	 (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
250	All	 Yeah. Yeah. A little.
251	Dr. Oberman	 Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..
252	Ross	 You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
253		(He turns to go, but the sound of the sonogram catches hes ear. He returns and stares at it.)
254	Ross	 Oh my God.
255	Susan	 Look at that.
256	Carol	 I know.
257		Closing Credits
258	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram. Rachel is on the phone.]
259	Ross	 Well? Isn't that amazing?
260	Joey	 What are we supposed to be seeing here?
261	Chandler	 I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
262	Phoebe	 You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
263	Ross	 Then don't do that, alright?
264	Phoebe	 Okay!
265	Ross	 (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?
266	Monica	 (welling up) Mm-hmm.
267	Ross	 Wh- are you welling up?
268	Monica	 No.
269	Ross	 You are, you're welling up.
270	Monica	 Am not!
271	Ross	 You're gonna be an aunt.
272	Monica	 (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
273	Rachel	 (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
