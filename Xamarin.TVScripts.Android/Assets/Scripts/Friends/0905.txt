227	Phoebe	 Aw ... what?
228	Rachel	 N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
229	Monica	 Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she toldme she was out of town.
230	Rachel	 Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is onthe ground.
231	Phoebe	 's a good toast.
232	Rachel	 (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?
233	Ross	 W-oa ... Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
234	Phoebe	 (getting up) Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pickup the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I'm sorry, was thatrude?

Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, butall I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday.And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy tocall.
