7	Monica	 Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
8	Phoebe	 I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.
9	Monica	 Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.
10	Phoebe	 Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
11	Monica	 Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
12	Phoebe	 Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.
13	Monica	 Where’s that?
14	Phoebe	 In your atlas!
15	Monica	 I don’t have an atlas.
16	Phoebe	 Oh.
17	Monica	 Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
18	Phoebe	 Oh.
19	Monica	 Hold on.
20	Joey	 So Pheebs what’s this guy like?
21	Phoebe	 Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
22	Monica	 ‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)
23	Phoebe	 What is this?
24	Monica	 It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
25		(Phoebe puts the globe right up next to her eye to try and find the country.)
26	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.
27	Monica	 Oh, no thanks.
28	Chandler	 Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
29	Monica	 Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
30	Joey	 Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
31	Chandler	 Yeah! You wanna come?
32	Joey	 Yeah!
33		Opening Credits
34	[Scene	 The Xerox place, Chandler and Joey are waiting in line.]
35	Chandler	 Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
36	Issac	 (to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?
37	Chandler	 Uh-oh.
38	Joey	 Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.
39	Issac	 Chloe, switch with me, there’s some guys here that got a crush on you.
40	Chandler	 (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.
41	Chloe	 Hi guys. I haven’t seen you since this morning.
42	Chandler	 Well ah, ........y'know.
43	Chloe	 Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
44	Joey	 Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)
45	Chloe	 Maybe. Does that scare ya?
46		(They both start laughing. They look at each other, stop and step apart a little bit.)
47	Chloe	 Relax. It’s just Issac’s D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
48	Joey	 We’ll be there.
49	Chloe	 Great. I’ll ah, see ya then.
50	Chandler	 All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)
51	[Scene	 A Street, Phoebe is walking along with the diplomat (Sergei) and his translator (Mischa).]
52	Sergei	 (something in Russian or Polish)
53	Mischa	 He’s says, ‘Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.’
54	Phoebe	 Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.
55		(Sergei goes up to her at her door and says something.)
56	Mischa	 (leaning in) Your eyes are very pretty.
57	Phoebe	 (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!
58		(Sergei says something and leans in to kiss her, but just as he’s about to....)
59	Mischa	 (leaning in) He would like to kiss you.
60	Phoebe	 (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now. (Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over.
61		(Sergei says something and kisses her.)
62	Phoebe	 Oh.
63	Mischa	 Oy!
64	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is showing Monica where Sergei’s country is.]
65	Phoebe	 (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.
66	Monica	 Wow! It’s small.
67	Phoebe	 Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
68	Monica	 So you had fun, huh?
69	Phoebe	 Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.
70	Monica	 No.
71	Ross	 (entering) Hey.
72	Phoebe and Monica	 Hey.
73	Ross	 What is ah, Rach in her room?
74	Monica	 Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
75	Ross	 Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?
76	Monica	 All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.
77	Ross	 What’s that on the bottom?
78	Monica	 Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) She’s fancy.
79		(Ross calls Rachel)
80	Rachel	 (answering her phone at work) Hello.
81	Ross	 Hey, honey.
82	Rachel	 Oh, hi.
83	Ross	 Hey, what’s going on?
84	Rachel	 Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.
85	Ross	 What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
86	Rachel	 No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much to deal with.
87		[Cut to kitchen.]
88	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.
89	Monica	 Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
90	Phoebe	 Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
91	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the big couch.]
92	Chandler	 Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
93	Joey	 Uh, 10
94	Chandler	 What time is it now?
95	Joey	 4
96	Chandler	 Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.
97	Joey	 Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
98	Chandler	 Yes. Vividly.
99	Joey	 She was kidding about that right?
100	Chandler	 Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...
101	Joey	 God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
102	Chandler	 Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
103	Joey	 Dude, I don’t know.
104	Chandler	 She was kidding.
105	Joey	 Yeah.
106	Chandler	 She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
107	Joey	 Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.
108	Chandler	 Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
109	Joey	 Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
110	Chandler	 Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
111	Joey	 Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?
112	Chandler	 Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.
113	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Rachel and a co-worker (Sophie) are dealing with the crisis.]
114	Rachel	 (on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding.
115	Ross	 (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!
116	Rachel	 (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
117	Ross	 Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the basket)
118	Sophie	 You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That’s it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
119	Rachel	 Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
120	Ross	 Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
121	Rachel	 Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.
122	Ross	 Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here. (lights a candle)
123	Rachel	 But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?! (listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the phone!
124	Sophie	 I love Mark. (to Ross) Do you know Mark?
125	Ross	 Yeah!!
126	Rachel	 Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)
127	Ross	 (stopping grinding) Pepper?
128	Rachel	 (angrily) None for me.
129	Ross	 Okay sorry, whew.
130	Rachel	 I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!
131	Ross	 (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
132	Rachel	 (on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?
133	Ross	 I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
134	Rachel	 Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.
135	Ross	 Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?
136	Rachel	 I don’t have ten minutes!!
137	Ross	 What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
138	Rachel	 Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!
139	Ross	 Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.
140	Rachel	 Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out)
141	Ross	 Yeah, but wait...
142	Rachel	 Good bye!
143		(Ross starts to pack up the picnic in anger, and throws a three hole punch in the basket.)
144	Sophie	 Actually, that’s our three hole punch.
145	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]
146	Ross	 Hey.
147	Rachel	 Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
148	Ross	 No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
149	Rachel	 (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
150	Ross	 For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
151	Rachel	 You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
152	Ross	 Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
153	Rachel	 But I told you, I didn’t have the time!
154	Ross	 Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
155	Rachel	 Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
156	Ross	 No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!
157	Rachel	 Just a job!
158	Ross	 Yes.
159	Rachel	 Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
160	Ross	 No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.
161	Rachel	 Well neither do I!
162	Ross	 Is this about Mark?
163	Rachel	 (shocked) Oh my God.
164	Ross	 Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
165	Rachel	 Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.
166	Ross	 Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
167	Rachel	 I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
168	Ross	 Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
169	Rachel	 No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
170		(Ross looks at her, then leaves slamming the door behind him.)
171		Commercial Break
172	[Scene	 The Philly, Chandler and Joey are talking to Chloe.]
173	Chloe	 And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
174		(Chandler agrees in an absolutely bored way.)
175	Chloe	 (seeing Ross enter) Hey, it’s the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross) Hi, Ross.
176	Ross	 Oh, hi Chloe.
177	Chloe	 I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’
178	Chandler	 And that’s the only colour that comes in.
179	Issac	 Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
180	Chloe	 Oh! (storms off)
181	Chandler	 So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
182	Ross	 Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.
183		(Chandler and Joey stare at each other in shock.)
184	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Monica and Phoebe are on their dates with Sergei and Mischa.]
185	Monica	 Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?
186	Mischa	 Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
187	Monica	 Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
188	Phoebe	 (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
189		(Mischa does so.)
190	Phoebe	 You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.
191	Mischa	 (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.
192		(Sergei responds.)
193	Mischa	 He says he was too.
194	Phoebe	 Interesting.
195	Mischa	 (to Monica) So I was wondering....
196	Phoebe	 Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
197		(Mischa does so, and Sergei complements Phoebe, and says it slowly)
198	Mischa	 (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a chef?
199	Monica	 I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
200	Mischa	 Oh, really.
201	Phoebe	 Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?
202	Monica	 Well, I was having a conversation.
203	Phoebe	 Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.
204	Monica	 What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
205	Phoebe	 That would be great. Thank you.
206	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is lying in front of the bay window, and the phone rings.]
207	Rachel	 (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!
208	Mark	 Oh, hi. It’s Mark.
209	Rachel	 (disappointed) Oh.
210	Mark	 What? Is it my breath?
211	Rachel	 No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
212	Mark	 Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn’t tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
213	Rachel	 Yeah. Well, umm.....
214	Mark	 Rach, are you okay?
215	Rachel	 (on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine.
216	Mark	 You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
217	Rachel	 No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.
218	Mark	 All right, all right, I’m coming over, and I’m bringing Chinese food.
219	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.
220	Mark	 It’s for me.
221	Rachel	 Oh. Okay, bye.
222	[Scene	 The Philly.]
223	Joey	 So what are you gonna do?
224	Ross	 What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
225	Chandler	 Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
226	Ross	 Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?
227	Chandler	 Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
228		(Ross goes to call her.)
229	Chandler	 Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
230	Joey	 Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
231	Chandler	 Why? What happened to him?
232	Joey	 Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.
233	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]
234	Rachel	 Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.
235	Mark	 Wow. I’m sorry. Eggroll?
236	Rachel	 No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.
237	Mark	 Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.
238	Rachel	 Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.
239		(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)
240	Rachel	 Hello.
241	Ross	 Hi! It’s me.
242	Rachel	 Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.
243	Ross	 Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
244	Mark	 Hey, what do you want to drink?
245	Ross	 Who’s that?
246	Rachel	 Nobody.
247	Mark	 Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
248		(Rachel mouths ‘Shoot!’ or something similar.)
249	Ross	 Is that Mark?
250	Rachel	 Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
251		[Cut to The Philly.]
252	Ross	 Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)
253	Chloe	 Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
254	Ross	 Ah, that’s okay, thanks.
255	Chloe	 Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.
256	Ross	 Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
257	Chloe	 Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him)
258	[Scene	 The Restaurant, after dinner.]
259	Mischa	 (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
260	Monica	 Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
261	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
262		(Sergei says something to Mischa.)
263	Mischa	 (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
264	Phoebe	 Well, tell him, apology accepted.
265		(Mischa does so.)
266	Mischa	 (to Monica) Oh, he’s unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English, Sergei?
267	Phoebe	 Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?
268	Monica	 Hey, the man’s dog just died.
269		(Sergei insults Mischa, and they get into a huge fight, in Russian.)
270	Mischa	 (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
271	Monica	 It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)
272	Sergei	 Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?
273	Phoebe	 Plate! Yes, plate.
274	Sergei	 Plate. Plate. Plate.
275	Phoebe	 See, we don’t need them.
276	Sergei	 (picking up a cup) Plate?
277	Phoebe	 Yeah.
278	[Scene	 The Philly, With or Without You is playing. (Which is the same song Ross played for Rachel in TOW the List.)]
279	Ross	 (to Chloe) I like this song.
280	Chloe	 Well, you’re practically dancing already. Why don’t you just do it over here?
281	Ross	 Oh, no, no.
282	Chloe	 What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay.
283	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is next to the bay window again, Mark has left.]
284	Rachel	 (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.
285	[Scene	 The Philly, Ross is dancing with Chloe.]
286	Chloe	 Still no smile?
287		(She kisses him. Ross leans back for a second, and then they both kiss, more passionately this time as U2's With or Without You plays in the background.)
288		To Be Continued......
