2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is sitting in the living room as Monica enters.]
3	Monica	 Hey.
4	Chandler	 Hey.
5		(Monica notices something.)
6	Monica	 Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
7	Chandler	 Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.
8	Monica	 Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
9	Chandler	 No, it wasn’t you.
10	Monica	 Well then who?
11	Chandler	 I got a maid. Yay!
12	Monica	 (shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…
13	Chandler	 Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
14	Monica	 Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
15	Chandler	 Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
16	Monica	 Did she really say that?
17	Chandler	 Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
18	Monica	 Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.
19	Chandler	 What’s the matter?
20	Monica	 Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!
21		Opening Credits
22	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there as someone’s cell phone starts to ring with one of those fancy ring tones.]
23	Phoebe	 (looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.
24	Ross	 I think it’s coming from your bag.
25	Phoebe	 (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
26	Eric	 Hi, it’s Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula’s fianc�e.
27	Phoebe	 Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?
28	Eric	 Oh, I have a friend who’s a cop and he got it for me.
29	Phoebe	 Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
30	Eric	 Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
31	Phoebe	 Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
32	Rachel	 Wow! What did he do?
33	Phoebe	 Shhh! I’m talking.
34	Eric	 Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eats lunch.
35	Phoebe	 Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
36	Eric	 Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye.
37	Phoebe	 No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.
38	Eric	 Uhh, I won’t take no for an answer.
39	Phoebe	 Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
40	Eric	 Great! But wh-wh—How do you know where I live?
41	Phoebe	 I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.
42	Eric	 Bye.
43		(She hangs up.)
44	Phoebe	 Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch. (Exits.)
45	Ross	 So apparently I’m available for lunch.
46	Rachel	 I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
47	Ross	 You’re moving?
48	Rachel	 Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) "How you doin’?"
49	Ross	 So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
50	Rachel	 Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
51	Ross	 That’s not really porn.
52	Rachel	 Not so much.
53	Ross	 Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
54	Rachel	 Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
55	Ross	 Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.
56	Rachel	 Yeah that would really be great.
57	Ross	 Yeah.
58	Rachel	 Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
59	Ross	 Yeah. No. No you’re right.
60		(Pause as they both take another sip of coffee.)
61	Rachel	 Shall we?
62	Ross	 Yeah.
63		(They both exit.)
64	[Scene	 Ross’s Building, they are approaching the apartment of the woman who died. Ross knocks on the door and a woman answers it.]
65	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 Yes?
66	Ross	 Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
67	Rachel	 And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.
68	Ross	 I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.
69	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 She didn’t pass.
70	Ross	 What?
71	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 My mother’s still alive.
72	Ross	 Oh, thank God!
73	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she’s a tough old bird.
74	Rachel	 Ahh.
75	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 Are you close with her?
76	Ross	 Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
77	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 You speak Dutch? (In Dutch) Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten. (Translation
78	Ross	 Y’know I would it’s just painful.
79	Rachel	 So she’s really not dead.
80	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 No, she’s hanging in there.
81	Rachel	 Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
82	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is observing the new maid, Brenda, clean.]
83	Brenda	 Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?
84	Monica	 Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.
85	Brenda	 Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator.
86	Monica	 (To Chandler) I love her.
87	Brenda	 I’ll be back in a minute.
88	Monica	 Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
89	Chandler	 See? I told you.
90	Monica	 She stole my jeans!
91	Chandler	 (pause) What?
92	Monica	 I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
93	Chandler	 So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
94	Monica	 Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!
95	Chandler	 She must’ve been planning this for years!
96	Monica	 I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
97	Chandler	 Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
98	Monica	 I guess.
99	Chandler	 So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
100	Monica	 Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.
101	Chandler	 Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
102	Monica	 Yeah! (Laughs.)
103	[Scene	 Eric’s Apartment, he’s opening the door to reveal Phoebe.]
104	Phoebe	 Hi!
105	Eric	 Come in, I’m so glad you’re here.
106	Phoebe	 Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
107	Eric	 Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
108	Phoebe	 Oh.
109	Eric	 Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just…I got so angry just looking at her…(Looks at Phoebe)…face.
110	Phoebe	 Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
111	Eric	 I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
112	Phoebe	 Maybe this is too weird.
113	Eric	 No wait! There’s only a problem when I look at you. (Sits down on the couch.) Oh I got it! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)
114	Phoebe	 No don’t tear out your eyes!!
115	Eric	 I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
116	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?
117	Eric	 Not really. You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You’re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe…If I-if I just don’t look at you for a while. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? It…it works. I’m not, I’m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
118	Phoebe	 Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)
119	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is reading some book and Gunther serves him a cup of coffee.]
120	Ross	 Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)
121	Gunther	 Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar? (Translation
122	Ross	 Yeah, we’re done.
123	Gunther	 Ezel. (Translation
124	Ross	 Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
125	Joey	 (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
126	Ross	 Really?!
127	Joey	 (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
128	Ross	 Sweet!
129	Joey	 All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.
130	Ross	 Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
131	Joey	 To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!
132	Ross	 No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
133	Joey	 Oh, you’re switching apartments?
134	Ross	 It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.
135	Joey	 But Rachel has an apartment.
136	Ross	 Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.
137	Joey	 She is?
138	Ross	 Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?
139	Joey	 I guess I didn’t really think about it.
140	Ross	 (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!
141	Gunther	 Jij hebt seks met ezels. (Translation
142	Ross	 Damnit!
143	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Brenda is sweeping and Monica is sitting at the kitchen table.]
144	Monica	 Nice jeans!
145	Brenda	 Oh thanks! I like your top.
146	Monica	 Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You’re not gettin’ it.
147		(Brenda bends down to use the dustpan and Monica leans over to look for the stain, but leans so far over she falls out of the chair.)
148	Brenda	 What happened?!
149	Monica	 Oh, I fell asleep.
150	Brenda	 I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
151	Monica	 Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.
152	Brenda	 All right.
153		(Brenda pulls a chair to the counter and uses it to get up on the counter in order to clean the top of the cabinets. Monica sneaks over, bends over, and tries to see the stain. That doesn’t work so she sticks her head between Brenda’s legs. Suddenly Brenda changes her stance and traps Monica’s head between her legs.)
154	Monica	 Hello.
155	Brenda	 What’s going on?!
156	Monica	 I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?
157		Commercial Break
158	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating pizza as Joey returns from the Knicks game.]
159	Rachel	 Hey!
160	Joey	 Hey!
161	Rachel	 How was the game?
162	Joey	 Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.
163	Rachel	 Oh.
164	Joey	 Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
165	Rachel	 Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
166	Joey	 I was kinda hoping you’d stay.
167	Rachel	 Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.
168	Joey	 No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? (Mumbles that it’s over in the corner.)
169	Rachel	 Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.
170	Joey	 I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.
171	Rachel	 Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
172	Joey	 I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.
173	Rachel	 I know.
174	Joey	 Y’know I blame Ross for this.
175	Rachel	 I do too a little bit.
176	Joey	 I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.
177	[Scene	 Eric’s Apartment, he and Phoebe are still making out.]
178	Phoebe	 Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
179	Eric	 Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.
180	Phoebe	 No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.
181	Eric	 Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way you kiss.
182	Phoebe	 Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. (Exits.)
183	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Brenda is shaking out the rugs on the balcony as Monica pouts in the living room.]
184	Chandler	 (entering) Hi!
185	Monica	 Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
186	Chandler	 How come?
187	Monica	 Because I put my head between her legs.
188	Chandler	 To see her pants?
189	Monica	 They’re my pants!
190	Chandler	 Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
191	Monica	 No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
192	Chandler	 God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
193	Monica	 Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She’s wearing my bra!
194	Chandler	 Oh dear God!
195	Monica	 My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
196	Chandler	 And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
197	Monica	 Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!
198	Chandler	 Here’s another plan…No!
199	Monica	 I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!
200	Chandler	 Why?
201	Monica	 Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!
202	Chandler	 I fear a jury will see it the same way!
203	Monica	 Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!
204	Chandler	 You see that?
205	Monica	 Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.)
206	Chandler	 All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
207	Monica	 Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.
208	Chandler	 You need new clothes.
209	[Scene	 Mrs. Verhoeven’s Apartment, Ross is back to inquire about the elder Verhoeven’s health or lack there of.]
210	Ross	 Hi. How is she?
211	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 It’s not looking good.
212	Ross	 (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
213	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 That’s so sweet. (Takes the flowers.) Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I’m sure it would mean a lot to her.
214	Ross	 Oh I don’t know that it would.
215	Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
216	Ross	 All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
217	[Scene	 Eric’s Apartment, he’s resting on the bed as Phoebe enters.]
218	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
219	Eric	 Welcome back!
220	Phoebe	 Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
221	Eric	 I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
222	Phoebe	 Why?
223	Eric	 Uh, the sex.
224	Phoebe	 What sex?
225	Eric	 Our sex.
226	Phoebe	 We didn’t have sex.
227	Eric	 Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…
228	Phoebe	 (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
229	Eric	 (simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
230	Phoebe	 You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!
231	Eric	 Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and…
232	Phoebe	 You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
233	Eric	 Well I was just so excited to see you.
234	Phoebe	 Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.
235	Eric	 No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.
236	Phoebe	 So I guess this is it.
237	Eric	 Yeah. (They hug.) Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her.
238	Phoebe	 Yeah, so do you.
239	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Brenda is wiping the coffee table and Chandler is trying to look at her bra and leans over on the coffee table to get a good look.]
240	Brenda	 (noticing him) What are you doing?
241	Chandler	 I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
242	Brenda	 Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
243	Chandler	 Brenda a bee!
244	Brenda	 What?
245	Chandler	 Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
246	Brenda	 I think I know what’s going on here.
247	Chandler	 You do?
248	Brenda	 Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’s wrong. You’re married.
249	Chandler	 I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?
250	[Scene	 The Hallway, Monica is sitting on the step as Rachel returns.]
251	Rachel	 Hi!
252	Monica	 (looking at Rachel’s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!
253	Rachel	 You gave them to me!
254	Monica	 No I didn’t!
255	Rachel	 All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
256	Monica	 Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
257	Rachel	 What bra?
258	Monica	 The pink one with the flowers?!
259	Rachel	 You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
260	Brenda	 (entering) I quit! (Storms off.)
261	Monica	 Sounds about right.
262	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel enters and notices that Joey has set up a space for the baby where the couch was, complete with a crib.]
263	Rachel	 What is this?
264	Joey	 Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
265	Rachel	 You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)
266	Joey	 Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
267	Rachel	 But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.
268	Joey	 I’m loud!
269	Rachel	 It’s gonna be up all night!
270	Joey	 I’m up all night!
271	Rachel	 It’s gonna poop!
272	Joey	 Hello!
273	Rachel	 What about all the women you want to bring home?
274	Joey	 Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
275	Rachel	 Joey, are you sure?
276	Joey	 Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
277	Rachel	 I want me to stay too.
278	Joey	 Ohh!
279	Rachel	 Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!
280	Joey	 I know! I found it on the street.
281	Rachel	 Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.
282	Joey	 Yeah.
283	Rachel	 Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?
284	Joey	 I don’t know.
285	Rachel	 It’s moving.
286	Joey	 Ew.
287	Rachel	 It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
288	Joey	 Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)

291	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Rachel are toasting her staying put.]
292	Ross	 Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
293	Rachel	 Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
294	Joey	 Isn’t that great?
295	Ross	 (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
