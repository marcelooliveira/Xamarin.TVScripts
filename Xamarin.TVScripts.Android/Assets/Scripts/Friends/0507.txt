2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Joey is looking at a National Geographic and giggling.]
3	Chandler	 Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
4	Joey	 No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)
5	Chandler	 That's a pig.
6	Joey	 I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
7		(Ross enters and his hair is a mess.)
8	Chandler	 Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
9	Ross	 Emily's cousin kicked me out!
10	Chandler	 What?!
11	Joey	 Why?
12	Ross	 Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
13	Chandler	 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
14	Ross	 Who needs a lease when it's family!
15	Joey	 Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
16	Chandler	 Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
17	Joey	 Yeah.
18	Ross	 You got it.
19	Joey	 Okay.
20	Ross	 Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
21		(Joey starts giggling.)
22	Ross	 What?
23	Chandler	 He thought you said gonad.
24		(Joey busts out laughing.)
25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Monica's restaurant, she is getting inspected by the health department, Phoebe is watching.]
27	Health Inspector	 Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
28	Monica	 Oh, Larry.
29	Phoebe	 Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
30	Larry	 No, bribes.
31		(Phoebe laughs.)
32	Phoebe	 It's okay to laugh right?
33	Larry	 Yeah, I was just kidding.
34	Phoebe	 Okay. (She laughs harder.)
35	Larry	 I'll check the kitchen floors.
36	Monica	 Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
37		(He goes into the kitchen.)
38	Phoebe	 Yum-my!
39	Monica	 Larry?
40	Phoebe	 Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
41	Larry	 (entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
42	Monica	 Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
43	Larry	 And where is your hat?
44	Monica	 It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
45		(She heads for the kitchen door and just after she goes through the door…)
46	Larry	 Ahh that's the 2 points.
47	Phoebe	 Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
48	Larry	 Oh, I don't know about that.
49	Phoebe	 Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
50	Larry	 Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
51	Phoebe	 Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
52	Larry	 I-I'll call ya.
53	Phoebe	 Okay.
54		(Larry goes to leave but heads the wrong way and makes a quick sidestep to go out the right door.)
55	Phoebe	 He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
56	[Scene	 Central Perk, Gunther is serving Monica and Rachel.]
57	Monica	 Thanks.
58	Rachel	 Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
59	Monica	 Hmm?
60	Rachel	 How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
61	Monica	 He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…
62	Rachel	 Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
63	Monica	 Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
64		(Danny enters.)
65	Danny	 (To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.
66	Monica	 (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
67	Rachel	 I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
68	Danny	 (To them) Hey!
69	Rachel	 Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?
70	Danny	 Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
71	Monica	 Ohh, fun!
72	Rachel	 Ohh, great!
73	Danny	 Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
74	Rachel	 Yeah.
75	Danny	 Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)
76	Monica	 Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
77	Rachel	 (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
78	Monica	 And you're not gonna do that.
79	Rachel	 That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
80	Monica	 So-so there is no party.
81	Rachel	 No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
82	Monica	 I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
83	Rachel	 Exactly.
84	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, they're entering to find boxes strewn about the apartment.]
85	Joey	 Ross?
86	Ross	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
87	Chandler	 Love what you've done with the place.
88	Ross	 Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
89	Joey	 Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
90	Chandler	 Oh yeah!
91	Ross	 Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
92	Joey	 Hey, all right!
93	Ross	 Pretty cool, huh?
94		(They both laugh as Ross heads back to the bathroom.)
95	Joey	 (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
96	Chandler	 Oh, the tears are real.
97	[Scene	 A restaurant, Phoebe and Larry are having dinner.]
98	Larry	 You look beautiful this evening.
99	Phoebe	 (smiles) Show me the badge again.
100		(He looks around and flashes her his badge and she laughs.)
101	Phoebe	 Shiny.
102	Larry	 Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.
103	Phoebe	 (laughing) You are just nonstop!
104		(He goes to the bathroom and Phoebe puts some pepper and salt on her food. With the salt she takes a bit and throws it over her left shoulder as she faces us.)
105	Larry	 (coming back) We're outta here!
106	Phoebe	 Why?!
107	Larry	 Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
108	Phoebe	 (awed) You have the power to do that?
109	Larry	 This does. (Shows her his badge.)
110	Phoebe	 (excited) Shut it down.
111	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is entering. As he closes the door, Joey pokes his head up from a box enclosure built using the 2 chairs.]
112	Joey	 Hey.
113	Chandler	 What are you doing?
114	Joey	 Nothing.
115	Chandler	 You built a fort didn't ya?
116	Joey	 (smiles) Kinda.
117	Chandler	 (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
118	Joey	 Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
119	Chandler	 I hate this thing!
120	Joey	 Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
121	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is opening the door.]
122	Rachel	 Oh, hi Danny.
123	Danny	 Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
124	Monica	 Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
125	Rachel	 Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
126	Monica	 You are?
127	Rachel	 Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
128	Danny	 Yeah, what's the gala for?
129	Rachel	 It's a uh, regatta gala.
130	Danny	 Really! You-you sail?
131	Rachel	 No-no, but I support it.
132	Danny	 Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.
133	Monica	 Okay.
134	Danny	 Take care. (Leaves.)
135	Rachel	 Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
136	Monica	 What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
137	Rachel	 Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
138	Monica	 Great. So the ball is in his court?
139	Rachel	 Ball? There is no ball.
140	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Ross is working on his computer and Joey is making a lot of noise.]
141	Ross	 (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
142	Joey	 Sorry.
143		(Joey starts playing with a toy alligator and has it attack him.)
144	Joey	 Ahhhhhhhhhh…
145		(Notices Ross looking at him and stops. Ross gives him his 'quiet down' maneuver. Okay, this may take a while to explain, so center this on you screen and place your hands about a foot apart with your fingers together and pointing straight up. Now take you fingers and point them at the other hand and making a 90-degree angle with each of your hands and the first knuckle counting up from the wrist. Now take your right hand, no your other right (that was for the dyslexics), and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.)
146	Chandler	 (entering) Hello children!
147	Joey	 Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
148	Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
149	Joey	 No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
150		(They go into his bedroom.)
151	Joey	 All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
152	Chandler	 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
153	Joey	 No, the quiet down thing!
154	Chandler	 You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
155	Joey	 Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
156	Chandler	 (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
157	Joey	 All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
158	Chandler	 Okay.
159		(They start playing.)
160	Chandler	 No-no-no-no!
161	Joey	 YES!!
162	Ross	 (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
163	Chandler	 Okay, so he's out of here.
164	Joey	 Um-hmm.
165		Commercial Break
166	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
167	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
168	Monica	 Hey!
169	Joey	 You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
170	Phoebe	 Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
171	Joey	 Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
172	Monica	 I don't know, clean places?
173	Joey	 Umm, yum!
174		(There's a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)
175	Monica	 (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
176	Rachel	 Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
177	Monica	 (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?
178	Rachel	 What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
179	Monica	 The fake kind!
180		(She opens the door and Rachel hides behind it.)
181	Danny	 Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
182	Monica	 We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
183	Danny	 Thanks, see you at the party.
184	Monica	 Okay, great!
185		(He leaves and she closes the door.)
186	Phoebe	 Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." (Laughs.)
187	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are there. Chandler and Joey are looking through the paper.]
188	Chandler	 Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
189	Ross	 I'll take sports.
190	Joey	 Mine! (He grabs it.)
191	Ross	 All right. Uhh, international.
192	Joey	 Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
193	Ross	 Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
194	Chandler	 Not even on page 7?
195	Ross	 (looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
196	Chandler	 What about that circled one?
197	Ross	 Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
198	Joey	 But it's available now! Isn't it?
199	Chandler	 Yes, it is.
200	Joey	 Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
201	Ross	 Okay, let's go.
202	Joey	 Okay!
203	Chandler	 There we go!
204	Ross	 Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
205	Chandler	 Let's go quicker.
206	Joey	 Yeah!
207	[Scene	 The apartment in the listing, the guys are checking it out. There's one problem though, it's roughly the size of this computer screen. As they enter Joey lets out a whistle.]
208	Ross	 Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
209	Chandler	 Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
210	Joey	 Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
211		(They don't move, just look all around them.)
212	Ross	 I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
213	Joey	 But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
214	Chandler	 Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
215	Joey	 Yeah.
216		(He looks at them.)
217	Ross	 (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
218	Joey	 Oh, it's perfect!
219	Ross	 (To Chandler) How about you?
220	Chandler	 It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
221	Ross	 All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
222		(He exits.)
223	Chandler	 We are bad people.
224	Joey	 He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
225	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there waiting for Larry.]
226	Larry	 (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?
227	Phoebe	 Ooh, absolutely!
228	Larry	 Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
229	Phoebe	 Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.
230	Larry	 How about Mama Lisettie's?
231	Phoebe	 Enh. Sure!
232	Larry	 (notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been setting out.
233	Phoebe	 Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!
234		(Just as they're about to leave, Gunther comes out of the back carrying two garbage bags. Larry sees this and stops him.)
235	Larry	 Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
236	Gunther	 But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
237	Larry	 Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
238	Phoebe	 Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
239	Larry	 Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
240	Phoebe	 Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
241	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are lamenting about how they kicked Ross out.]
242	Joey	 Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
243	Chandler	 Yes that was a nice place!
244	Joey	 Yeah!
245	Chandler	 Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
246	Joey	 Yeah!
247		(Pause.)
248	Chandler	 What are we gonna do?
249	Joey	 I don't know. Maybe pizza?
250	Chandler	 About Ross!
251	Joey	 Oh! Oh!
252		(The phone rings and Joey answers it.)
253	Joey	 Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
254	Chandler	 (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
255		(The apartment manager hung up on him and he hangs up the phone and throws in on the chair. Joey motions, "What the hell was that?" Chandler makes a face to say, "Think about it." Joey tries to divide 136 by 13; he's confused. Suddenly, light dawns on yonder dunder head. He gets it.)
256	Chandler	 Ohhhhh!
257		(Joey motions, "Now, that's thinking!")
258	[Scene	 Downstairs at Danny's party, Monica and Rachel are coming down the stairs and Rachel has on a coat to make it look as if she's just getting back. But just as they reach the landing they see Danny out in the hall talking to a guest, Rachel then quickly pulls Monica back up the stairs.]
259	Rachel	 Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
260	Monica	 Just go over and say hi.
261	Rachel	 No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
262		(Monica obeys.)
263	Monica	 Hey, Danny!
264	Danny	 Hey! What's going on?
265	Monica	 (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)
266	Danny	 Salad.
267	Monica	 Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)
268	Danny	 Bread. Aren't you a chef?
269		(Rachel returns.)
270	Monica	 (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
271	Danny	 Hey! Rachel!
272	Rachel	 Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
273	Danny	 Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
274	Rachel	 Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
275	Danny	 Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)
276	Rachel	 Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
277	Monica	 I thought there wasn't a ball?
278	Rachel	 Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
279	Danny	 (returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) This is the girl I told you about.
280	Rachel	 Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
281	Danny	 You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)
282	Tom	 So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
283	Rachel	 (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
284	Tom	 I'm sorry?
285	Rachel	 No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
286	Tom	 I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
287	Rachel	 Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
288		(He walks off.)
289	Rachel	 Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
290	Monica	 I think I need a drink.
291	Rachel	 Yeah!
292		(They go get a drink.)
293	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross still has boxes all over the place. Joey is wearing a football helmet, and Chandler is spinning him around in one of the chairs and counting.]
294	Chandler	 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
295	Joey	 (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
296		(He tries to get up again and starts falling backwards and Chandler catches him.)
297	Chandler	 Here we go! Here we go!
298		(Ross enters.)
299	Joey	 Hey!
300	Chandler	 Hey!
301	Ross	 Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
302	Joey	 You're kidding!
303	Chandler	 You're kidding, no!
304	Ross	 Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…
305	Joey	 But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
306	Ross	 Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
307	Joey	 Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
308	Chandler	 Yeah!
309	Ross	 Are you guys sure about this?
310	Joey	 Definitely!
311	Chandler	 Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
312	Ross	 All right.
313	Joey	 All right!
314	Chandler	 All right, buddy!
315	Ross	 So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the 'quiet down' maneuver).
316		(Chandler and Joey smile, but when Ross turns away look at each other with looks of horror.)
317		Ending Credits
318	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Chandler is entering and when he closes the door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy hat.]
319	Chandler	 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
320	Ross	 (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
321	Chandler	 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
322	Joey	 Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
323		(Chandler does so.)
