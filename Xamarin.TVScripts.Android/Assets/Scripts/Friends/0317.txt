2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch reading.]
3	Joey	 Can I see the comics?
4	Chandler	 This is the New York Times.
5	Joey	 Okay, may I see the comics?
6		[Monica and Phoebe enter.]
7	Monica	 Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
8	Chandler	 We are. He’s meeting us here.
9	Monica	 No! Rachel is meeting us here.
10	Phoebe	 Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
11	Joey	 Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
12	Phoebe	 Why? What happened now?
13	Joey	 Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
14	Chandler	 Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
15	Joey	 Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
16	Phoebe	 Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.
17	Joey	 Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
18	Phoebe	 Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
19	Chandler	 Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
20	Phoebe	 Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
21	Joey	 I had the same dream!
22	Phoebe	 Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
23	Joey	 Oh, I had the opposite dream.
24	Chandler	 Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.
25	Joey	 Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
26	Monica	 It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
27		[Rachel enters.]
28	Monica	 (seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!
29	Rachel	 Hey!
30	Monica	 Let’s get the show on it!
31	Rachel	 Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
32	Monica	 Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.
33	Rachel	 Closer than here?
34	Phoebe	 (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.
35	Rachel	 Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.
36	Phoebe	 Okay, your highness.
37		[Ross enters behind Rachel, and look at each other for a moment.]
38	Phoebe	 (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!
39		Opening Credits
40	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, the whole gang is there, except for Ross and Rachel. Joey is trying to eat Chinese with chopsticks and fails miserably. There’s a knock on the door, and Chandler answers it to reveal Rachel]
41	Rachel	 (softly) Is he here?
42	Chandler	 No.
43	Rachel	 Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!
44	Monica and Phoebe	 Hey!
45	Rachel	 You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?
46	Chandler	 Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
47	Rachel	 Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
48	Phoebe	 No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
49	Rachel	 Hm-mm.
50	Chandler	 Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
51	Rachel	 Ohh!
52	Monica	 We’re sorry honey.
53	Rachel	 Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)
54	Joey	 Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?
55	Rachel	 And heels.
56	Joey	 (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
57	Rachel	 No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)
58		[Chandler makes a noise of absolute disgust and heads into the living room.]
59	Phoebe	 Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
60	Joey	 Oh yeah.
61	Monica	 Very bad.
62		[We see Chandler lighting up a cigarette.]
63	Phoebe	 Chandler what are you doing?!
64	Monica	 Chandler!!
65	Chandler	 (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
66	Joey	 You’re smoking again?!
67	Chandler	 Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.
68	Phoebe	 Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
69	Chandler	 Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
70	Monica	 Weren’t you nine?!
71	Chandler	 Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
72		[There’s a knock on the door.]
73	Chandler	 Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.
74	Phoebe	 Him? Him, Ross?
75	Chandler	 Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)
76	Rachel	 Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.
77	All	 Absolutely, yeah!
78	Rachel	 Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!
79	Chandler	 Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!
80	[Scene	 Ross’s, the gang, minus Rachel of course, is there. Chandler is forced to smoke by an open window.]
81	Joey	 (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
82	Phoebe	 Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.
83	Ross	 Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
84	Chandler	 Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
85	Ross	 Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!
86	Joey	 It’ll be great for next weekend.
87	Ross	 No, no, no, this weekend guys!
88	Joey	 It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it’ll be grrreat.
89	Ross	 What’s going on?
90	Phoebe	 Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)
91	Ross	 So, for the whole weekend?
92	Monica	 We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
93	Ross	 Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
94	Phoebe	 Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
95	Joey	 Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.
96	Monica	 Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.
97	Ross	 What a pity stay?
98	Monica	 No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
99	Ross	 Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
100	Chandler	 Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
101	[Scene	 In Phoebe’s Grandmother’s cab, driving up to the cabin. Phoebe’s driving, Rachel’s sitting shotgun, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are in the back seat.]
102	Joey	 (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
103	Monica	 Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?
104	Chandler	 (to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
105	Joey	 What? Mine aren’t tinted.
106		[Chandler starts to light a cigarette.]
107	Phoebe	 Chandler!!
108	Chandler	 What?
109	Phoebe	 What does the sign say?
110	Chandler	 Beam me up Jesus.
111	Phoebe	 No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.
112	Chandler	 Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
113	All	 Oh!
114	Phoebe	 Please!
115	Monica	 No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
116	Chandler	 Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
117	Joey	 Oh, now I have to go!!
118	[Scene	 The rest stop, Phoebe’s pulling in.]
119	Chandler	 Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
120	Monica	 What?
121		[Both Chandler and Joey put their feet up against the glass, Monica doesn’t and gets thrown up against the glass.]
122	Rachel	 Okay.
123	Monica	 Ow!
124		[Joey gets out and sprints to the bathroom and Chandler follows with a cigarette in his hands.]
125	Phoebe	 (to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?
126	Rachel	 No. Thank you.
127	Monica	 (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
128	Rachel	 Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)
129	Phoebe	 No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.
130	Chandler	 Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
131	Joey	 What’s going on?
132	Chandler	 (to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)
133		Commercial Break
134	[Scene	 The rest stop, the gang is still stuck, Chandler is kneeling at the rear bumper.]
135	Chandler	 Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
136	Joey	 Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
137	Chandler	 Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
138	Monica	 So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?
139	Joey	 Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
140	Monica	 What?!
141	Rachel	 What?!
142	Joey	 Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
143	Monica	 Please!!
144	Joey	 Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
145	The Girls	 No, not getting my bra!
146	Joey	 If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
147	Phoebe	 Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.
148	Monica	 These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.
149	Rachel	 What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
150	Monica	 All right then, your bra would still be big.
151	Rachel	 No, I stuff outside the bra.
152	Chandler	 Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.
153	Phoebe	 All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
154		[Chandler crumples up his cigarette pack and throws it on the ground.]
155	Rachel	 (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
156	Chandler	 Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
157	Phoebe	 (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.
158	Joey	 Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
159	Chandler	 Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.
160	Joey	 (opening the door) And there you go!
161	All	 Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
162		[They all run to get in the cab, and Chandler pulls out a smoke.]
163	Monica	 Chandler!!
164	Chandler	 At least let me smoke it to the good part.
165		[Phoebe puts the car in gear and starts to back out.]
166	Phoebe	 Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!
167	Rachel	 What, what’s it, what’s going on?
168	Phoebe	 Yeah, this has happened before.
169	Rachel	 So you know how to fix it?
170	Phoebe	 Yep. Put more gas in.
171	[Scene	 Carol and Susan’s, Carol is setting a romantic dinner for Susan as there is a knock on the door.]
172	Carol	 (answering the door) Hi!
173	Ross	 (entering) Hey.
174	Carol	 Hey, what are you doing here?
175	Ross	 Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
176	Carol	 Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
177	Ross	 Where’s Ben?
178	Carol	 He’s sleeping.
179	Ross	 Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
180	Carol	 Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary.
181	Ross	 Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
182	Carol	 It’s not that kind of anniversary.
183	Ross	 Ah! (realises) Oh.
184	Carol	 Sooo!! Anyway...
185	Ross	 Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
186	Carol	 Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
187	Ross	 Yeah, well.
188	Carol	 Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
189	Ross	 Oh yeah, I’d love that.
190	Carol	 Oh, great! Me too.
191	Ross	 I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)
192	[Scene	 The rest stop, Phoebe is on the phone to the motor club.]
193	Phoebe	 Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.
194	Rachel	 Great!
195	Phoebe	 Yeah, what town are we near?
196	Monica	 Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
197	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?
198	Rachel	 Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
199	Phoebe	 Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?
200	Rachel	 I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
201	Phoebe	 Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do that.
202	Rachel	 Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
203	Monica	 Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
204	Rachel	 No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
205	Phoebe	 But if...
206	Rachel	 No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.
207	Phoebe	 Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
208		[Joey walks up helping Chandler.]
209	Monica	 So the going for help went well?
210	Joey	 Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
211	Chandler	 I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
212	Monica	 Then why are you smoking?
213	Chandler	 Well it’s very unsettling.
214	[Scene	 Carol and Susan’s, Ross is eating the dinner Carol made for Susan.]
215	Ross	 ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
216	Carol	 Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
217		[Ross’s beeper goes off.]
218	Ross	 (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?
219	Carol	 No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.
220		[Cut to the rest stop, Monica and Phoebe are waiting anxiously by the phone as it rings.]
221	Phoebe	 (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.
222	Ross	 Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
223	Phoebe	 I ate a bug.
224		[Rachel starts to walk up.]
225	Monica	 (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)
226	Phoebe	 Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.
227	Ross	 Oh, now you want a favour?
228	Phoebe	 Yes, please.
229	Ross	 Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
230	Carol	 (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe, hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
231	Ross	 No, I’m not gonna pick them up.
232	Carol	 Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
233	Ross	 No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....
234	Carol	 Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
235	Ross	 Yeah, you’re right.
236	Carol	 (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens) What? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!
237	Ross	 We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)
238	Carol	 You slept with another woman?
239	Ross	 Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.
240	[Scene	 The rest stop, Joey is making a sign.]
241	Joey	 Okay, done.
242	Monica	 (reading the sign) What’s ‘pleh’?
243	Joey	 That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
244	Monica	 Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?
245		[Ross drives up.]
246	Rachel	 (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!
247	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!
248	Chandler and Joey	 Hey!!
249	Phoebe	 Hi!
250	Rachel	 What is he doing here?!
251	Ross	 He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
252	All	 No! Come on!
253	Rachel	 All right!! Fine! Fine.
254		[Ross grabs the gas can he brought along, and walks through Joey’s sign destroying it.]
255	Joey	 Arrrghh!!
256	Chandler	 Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!
257	Phoebe	 (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?
258	Chandler	 Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.
259	Joey	 Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
260	Monica	 I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
261	Rachel	 Ask me what?
262	Monica	 Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
263	Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey	 No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no.
264	Rachel	 You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
265	Ross	 Excuse me?
266	Chandler	 It’s horrible.
267	Ross	 (sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?
268	Rachel	 Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
269	Ross	 Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
270	Monica	 Here we go again.
271	Joey	 I-I can’t handle this, you guys.
272	Chandler	 Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.
273	Ross	 All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.
274	Rachel	 All right, let’s go!
275	Ross	 You’re welcome.
276	Rachel	 Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
277	Ross	 We were on a break!
278	Rachel	 Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!
279	Ross	 Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
280	Rachel	 (to Monica) What?!
281	Monica	 (shyly) I don’t know.
282	Ross	 That’s what you said last night.
283	Monica	 What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!
284	Ross	 Okay.
285	Rachel	 Really Joey?
286	Joey	 (pause) What?
287	Phoebe	 Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
288	Rachel	 No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
289	Ross	 Obviously not to Joey.
290		[They all turn around and look at Joey.]
291	Joey	 (pause) What?
292		[They all start fighting with each other.]
293	Ross	 (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
294	Chandler	 Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
295		[They stop briefly to look at Chandler, but then start fighting again.]
296	Phoebe	 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
297	Joey	 Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
298	Phoebe	 Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?
299	Rachel	 Yeah.
300	Ross	 I can.
301	Phoebe	 Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
302	Joey	 Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?
303	Ross	 Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
304	Joey	 Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
305	Ross	 No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.
306	Rachel	 Thank you.
307	Monica	 All right, we’ll call you when we get back.
308	Ross	 Okay.
309	Phoebe	 Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
310	Ross	 Okay.
311	Phoebe	 Or, or the rodeo!!
312	Ross	 That would be great.
313	Phoebe	 Okay!
314	Chandler	 I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
315	Ross	 I know!
316		[They all get in the cab and drive away.]
317	Phoebe	 Bye!!!
318		[Ross tries to start the truck, and discovers the battery’s dead.]
319		Closing Credits

321	Carol	 (looking through the peephole) Ugh. (opening the door) Ross!
322	Ross	 (entering) Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
323	Carol	 Ahh, nooo!!
324	Ross	 Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
325	Carol	 You’re a genius, Ross.
326	Ross	 Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
