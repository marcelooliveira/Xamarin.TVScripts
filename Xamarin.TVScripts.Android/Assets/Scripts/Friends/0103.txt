3	Phoebe	 (entering) Hi guys!
4	All	 Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
5	Ross	 Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
6	Phoebe	 Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
7	All	 Ohh. Ouch.
8	Rachel	 What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
9	Monica	 Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
10	Rachel	 Since when?
11	Joey	 Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
12	Chandler	 Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
13	Phoebe	 Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
14	Rachel	 And everybody knows this?
15	Joey	 Yeah. Cushions the blow.
16	Chandler	 Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
17	Ross	 That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
18	Monica	 Uh, Ross.
19	Ross	 What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a part.]
22	Chandler	 "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
23	Joey	 "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
24	Chandler	 Hey, that was really good!
25	Joey	 Thanks! Let's keep going.
26	Chandler	 Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
27	Joey	 "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
28	Chandler	 "Smoke away."
29		(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He fumbles and drops the lighter. Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)
30	Chandler	 I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
31	Joey	 What?
32	Chandler	 Relax your hand!
33		(Joey lets his wrist go limp.)
34	Chandler	 Not so much!
35	Joey	 Whoah!
36	Chandler	 Hey!
37	Joey	 Hey!
38	Chandler	 Alright, now try taking a puff.
39		(Joey tries and visibly winces.)
40	Chandler	 Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
41	Joey	 No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
42	Chandler	 It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
43		(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)
44	Chandler	 Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
45	Joey	 Y'miss it?
46	Chandler	 Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
47		[Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.]
48	Monica	 No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
49		(The guys stretch out their fingers.)
50	Joey	 That's ridiculous!
51	Ross	 Can I use.. either thumb?
52	Rachel	 (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
53	All	 Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
54	Rachel	 (leaving to serve others) Good for me!
55		(The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters. She sits down without saying hi.)
56	Joey	 Y'okay, Phoebe?
57	Phoebe	 Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
58	Monica	 What did they do to you?
59	Phoebe	 It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
60	Ross	 Easy.
61	Phoebe	 - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
62	Chandler	 Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
63	Phoebe	 Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
64	Joey	 What are you talking about? Keep it!
65	Phoebe	 It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
66	Rachel	 Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
67	Phoebe	 Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
68	Monica	 We're with you. We got it.
69		(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)
70	Phoebe	 Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
71	Rachel	 Chandler, what are you doing?
72	Monica	 (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
73		(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)
74	All	 Oh! Oh, God!
75	Ross	 What is this?!
76	Chandler	 I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
77	Phoebe	 Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
78	Chandler	 And this- is my reward!
79	Ross	 Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
80	Chandler	 Okay, so this time I won't quit!
81	All	 Ohhh! Put it out!
82	Chandler	 All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
83	Phoebe	 Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
84	Monica	 Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
85	Rachel	 This Alan again? How's it goin'?
86	Monica	 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
87	Joey	 So when do we get to meet the guy?
88	Monica	 Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
89	All	 Oh, come on! Come on!
90	Monica	 No. Not after what happened with Steve.
91	Chandler	 What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
92	Monica	 Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
93	Rachel	 Well, then can we meet him?
94	Monica	 Nope. Schhorry.
95	[Scene	 Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]
96	Monica	 I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
97	Paula	 Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you
98	Monica	 I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
99	Paula	 Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
100	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]
101	Joey	 Let it go, Ross.
102	Ross	 Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
103	Monica	 Do you all promise?
104	All	 Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
105	Monica	 (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
106		(Chandler makes a 'Cross my heart' sign. It starts to rain and he taps on the window.)
107	Joey	 You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
108		(Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)
109		(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)
110	Ross	 Hey, Pheebs.
111	Phoebe	 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
112	Rachel	 What bank is this?
113		(The intercom buzzes.)
114	Monica	 Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
115	Alan	 (on the intercom) It's Alan.
116	Joey	 (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
117		(Chandler comes in, dripping wet.)
118	Monica	 (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
119		(She opens the door and Alan enters.)
120	Monica	 Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
121	Alan	 Hi.
122	All	 Hi, Alan.
123	Alan	 I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
124		(Everyone laughs.)
125		[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]
126	Monica	 (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
127		(Silence.)
128	Monica	 C'mon!
129	Ross	 ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
130	All	 Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
131	Monica	 Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
132	All	 Yeah!
133	Rachel	 And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)
134	The Guys	 (reluctantly) Yeah.
135	Joey	 Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
136	Phoebe	 Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
137	Ross	 ...What shoe?
138	Phoebe	 From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
139		(Dubious pause.)
140	Ross	 ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
141	Rachel	 What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
142	Monica	 Really!
143	Chandler	 Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
144	Ross	 You know what I like most about him, though?
145	All	 What?
146	Ross	 The way he makes me feel about myself.
147	All	 Yeah...
148		Commercial Break
149	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter dejectedly in softball gear.]
150	Monica	 Hi.. how was the game?
151	Ross	 Well..
152	All	 WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
153	Monica	 Fantastic! I have one question
154	Joey	 Alan.
155	Ross	 He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
156	Rachel	 I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
157	Chandler	 Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
158	Monica	 Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
159	Ross	 What?
160	Monica	 ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
161	Rachel	 Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
162	Ross	 Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
163	Chandler	 I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
164	[Scene	 A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.]
165	Phoebe	 Hey, Lizzie.
166	Lizzie	 Hey, Weird Girl.
167	Phoebe	 I brought you alphabet soup.
168	Lizzie	 Did you pick out the vowels?
169	Phoebe	 Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)
170	Lizzie	 Saltines?
171	Phoebe	 No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
172	Lizzie	 What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's really money in here.
173	Phoebe	 I know.
174	Lizzie	 Weird Girl, what are you doing?
175	Phoebe	 No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
176	Lizzie	 No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
177	Phoebe	 Oh, that's fine, no.
178	Lizzie	 Would you like my tin-foil hat?
179	Phoebe	 No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
180	Lizzie	 Please, let me do something.
181	Phoebe	 Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
182	Lizzie	 Okay.
183	Phoebe	 Okay.
184	[Scene	 Chandler's office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray. He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette. While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a squirt of air freshener and gags.]
185	[Scene	 A Street, Phoebe and Lizzie are at a hot dog vendor.]
186	Lizzie	 Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
187	Phoebe	 No, I'm fine.
188	Lizzie	 (leaves) See ya.
189		(Phoebe opens the can and reacts.)
190	Phoebe	 Huh!
191	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]
192	Ross	 A thumb?!
193		(Phoebe nods.)
194	All	 Eww!
195	Phoebe	 I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
196	Chandler	 Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
197	Phoebe	 Does, um, anyone wanna see?
198	All	 Nooo!
199		(Chandler lights a cigarette.)
200	All	 Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
201	Rachel	 It's worse than the thumb!
202	Chandler	 Hey, this is so unfair!
203	Monica	 Oh, why is it unfair?
204	Chandler	 So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
205		(An awkward silence ensues.)
206	Joey	 ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
207	Rachel	 Well, I-I could live without it.
208	Joey	 Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
209		(Phoebe spits out her hair.)
210	Ross	 Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
211	Joey	 Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?
212		(Monica laughs and snorts.)
213	Ross	 You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
214	Rachel	 "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
215	Phoebe	 Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
216	Rachel	 Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
217		(They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)
218	[Scene	 Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.]
219	Monica	 Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
220	Paula	 No.
221	Monica	 Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
222	Paula	 Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
223	Monica	 Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
224	Paula	 Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
225	Monica	 I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
226	Paula	 Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
227	Monica	 No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
228	[Scene	 Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]
229	Joey	 Do you have any respect for your body?
230	Ross	 Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
231	Chandler	 Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
232	Rachel	 (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
233	Chandler	 Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
234	Rachel	 (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good.
235	Ross	 If only he were a woman.
236	Rachel	 Yeah.
237		(They give each other a dubious look.)
238	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyond except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.]
239	Chandler	 Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
240	Ross	 Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)
241	Monica	 (entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
242	Chandler	 Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
243	Rachel	 I think he's across the hall.
244	Monica	 Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
245	Ross	 (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.
246	Chandler	 (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
247	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
248	Phoebe	 Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
249	Ross	 Hey, I might!
250	Phoebe	 Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
251	All	 You're kidding. Oh my God.
252	Phoebe	 And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
253	Joey	 (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?
254	Monica	 Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
255	Joey	 Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
256	Rachel	 Uh, Joey..
257	Joey	 Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)
258	Monica	 (turns off the TV) Okay..
259	All	 Oh! That was Lambchop!
260	Monica	 Please, guys, we have to talk.
261	Phoebe	 Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
262	Monica	 Alright, we have to talk.
263	Phoebe	 There it is!
264	Monica	 Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
265		(They all gasp and clutch each other.)
266	Ross	 Is there somebody else?
267	Monica	 No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
268	Rachel	 We didn't change..
269	Joey	 So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
270	Phoebe	 You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)
271	Monica	 Look, I- I could go on pretending-
272	Joey	 Okay!
273	Monica	 -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
274	Ross	 Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
275	Monica	 I'm sorry..
276	Chandler	 (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
277	Rachel	 (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
278	Monica	 I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
279	All	 Oh, yeah! Right!
280	Monica	 Are you guys gonna be okay?
281	Ross	 Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
282	Monica	 (dubious) I understand.
283	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Monica is breaking the news to Alan.]
284	Alan	 Wow.
285	Monica	 I'm, I'm really sorry.
286	Alan	 Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
287	Monica	 Relieved?
288	Alan	 Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
289		Closing Credits
290	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is mopping around and eating ice cream.]
291	Rachel	 Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
292	Ross	 Yeah. He could row like a viking.
293	Monica	 (entering) Hi.
294	All	 Mmm.
295	Ross	 So how'd it go?
296	Monica	 Oh, y'know..
297	Phoebe	 Did he mention us?
298	Monica	 He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
299	Ross	 You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)
300	Chandler	 ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
301	All	 No no no!
302	Chandler	 (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
303	Phoebe	 (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
304	Chandler	 (returns) Yeah, alright.
