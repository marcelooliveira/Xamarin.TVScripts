3	Ross	 Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
4	Monica	 Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
5	Chandler	 Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
6	Rachel	 Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'
7	Ross	 Rach, did you proofread these?
8	Rachel	 Uh... yeah, why?
9	Ross	 Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
10	Rachel	 (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
11	Joey	 Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
12		Opening Credits
13	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are sitting at a table. Rachel is working. Monica and Phoebe enter.]
14	Monica	 Hey, guys.
15	Chandler and Ross	 Hey.
16	Rachel	 Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly)
17	Monica	 Lots of responses.
18	Rachel	 (to Monica)
19	Phoebe	 (reading)
20	Rachel	 (out loud)
21	Monica	 (reading)
22	Phoebe	 Wow!
23	Rachel	 What?
24	Phoebe	 (reading)
25	Rachel	 (grabs the bill) Give me that!
26		(Camera cuts to Chandler and Ross at table.)
27	Chandler	 You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
28	Ross	 I don't know.
29	Chandler	 Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
30	Ross	 No, it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)
31	Chandler	 ...little playthings with yarn?
32	Ross	 What?
33	Chandler	 Could you want her more?
34	Ross	 Who?
35	Chandler	 (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
36	Ross	 Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table)
37	Rachel	 Hi! How are you?
38	Ross	 We're fine, we're fine.
39	Rachel	 OK. (walks away)
40		(Ross keeps staring at her, head on table. Chandler smacks him with a newspaper. Joey enters, Ross and Chandler laugh at him.)
41	Joey	 Shut up!
42	Chandler	 We're not—we're not saying anything.
43	Phoebe	 What?
44	Ross	 Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
45	Joey	 Thank you.
46	Chandler	 (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
47	Joey	 There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
48	Ross	 Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
49	Chandler	 And then he did.
50	Rachel	 Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
51	Phoebe	 Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
52	Ross	 No, women are welcome to play.
53	Phoebe	 Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
54	Chandler	 There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
55	Joey	 Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
56	Girls	 Oh, yeah, right.
57	Monica	 Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
58	Rachel	 Really.
59	Monica	 I mean, that's a typical guy response.
60	Ross	 Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
61	Girls	 No.
62	Rachel	 But you could teach us.
63	Guys	 No.
64	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]
65	Chandler	 (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
66	Monica	 So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
67	Rachel	 Oh, good for you!
68	Phoebe	 Congratulations!
69		(Microwave timer goes off. Monica gets up.)
70	Chandler	 OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
71	Phoebe	 OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
72	Ross	 No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't—you can't do...
73	Rachel	 Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)
74	Ross	 No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
75	Rachel	 Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
76	Ross	 Oh, you're... (gives up)
77		(Monica comes back to the table with plates of food.)
78	Monica	 Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
79	Phoebe and Rachel	 OOooooo!
80	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)
81	Chandler	 (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
82	Monica	 Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
83	Ross	 Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
84	Phoebe	 But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
85	Chandler	 OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.
86		(Time lapse.)
87	Monica	 (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
88	Phoebe	 (to Joey)
89	Joey	 About what?
90	Phoebe	 About how good your cards were.
91	Joey	 Heh... I was bluffing.
92	Phoebe	 A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
93	Rachel	 OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)
94	Guys	 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
95	Chandler	 Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
96	Rachel	 Settle what?
97	Chandler	 The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
98	Ross	 The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
99	Rachel	 Oh. Right.
100	Joey	 You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
101	Monica	 Hell no, we'll pay!
102	Phoebe	 OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
103	Monica	 And you know what? We want a rematch.
104	Ross	 Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
105	Rachel	 (to Ross)
106	Ross	 (pause)...Yeah.
107	Chandler	 Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
108	Ross	 Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
109	Joey	 (pause)...Yeah?
110	Ross	 I'm not a nice guy.
111	[Scene	 Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]
112	Ross	 Alright boys, let's eat.
113	Chandler	 Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
114	Ross	 You still on that?
115	Chandler	 Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking)
116	Ross	 You are way off, pal.
117	Joey	 No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
118	Ross	 Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any more. I just—I...
119		(Marcel makes a screeching noise in background.)
120	Ross	 Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
121		(Marcel puts a CD in the player.)
122	Ross	 You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
123		(The Lion Sleeps Tonight starts to play. Marcel starts to dance.)
124	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe are there.]
125	Rachel	 (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
126	Monica	 Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
127	Phoebe	 Ha. Ha, ha.
128	Monica	 What?
129	Phoebe	 Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
130	Monica	 Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
131	Rachel	 Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
132	Monica	 That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
133	Rachel	 Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised)
134	Monica	 You're kidding! Where? Where?
135	Rachel	 (in disbelief)
136	Monica	 Oh, Rachel!
137	Phoebe	 Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
138	Monica	 Well, what's the job?
139	Rachel	 Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
140		(Knock on door.)
141	Monica	 OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
142	Aunt Iris	 Is Tony Randall dead?
143	Rachel	 No.
144	Monica	 I don't think so.
145	Rachel	 Why?
146	Aunt Iris	 Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
147	Monica	 What?
148	Rachel	 Oh my God!
149	Monica	 Really?
150	Aunt Iris	 No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe)
151	Phoebe	 Thank y... (thinks about it)
152	Aunt Iris	 Girls, sit down.
153	Monica	 Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
154	Aunt Iris	 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
155	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, everyone but Rachel is seated around his table. The Lion Sleep Tonight plays in the background.]
156	Phoebe	 Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
157	Ross	 Alright.
158		(Ross shuts off the CD player. Marcel runs into the bedroom and slams the door.)
159	Ross	 I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
160		(Knock on door. Ross opens it. Rachel enters.)
161	Rachel	 Hi!
162	Ross	 Hey.
163	Rachel	 Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
164	Chandler	 Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
165	Rachel	 Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
166	All	 That's great! That's wonderful!
167	Rachel	 Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
168	Monica	 OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
169	Joey	 Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
170	Chandler	 Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
171		(The guys all duck under the table.)
172	Monica	 Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
173	Phoebe and Rachel	 Yes, we should. I think we should.
174	Ross	 Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
175	Rachel	 No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
176	Ross	 Alright.
177	Rachel	 Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)
178		Commercial Break
179	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
180	Ross	 So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
181	Joey	 But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
182	Phoebe	 Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
183	Joey	 What?
184	Phoebe	 Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
185	Chandler	 That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
186	Ross	 Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
187	Rachel	 Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)
188	Monica	 You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
189	Rachel	 Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
190	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there ready for another poker game.]
191	Ross	 So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
192	Rachel	 Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
193	Monica	 OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
194	Phoebe	 (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.
195		(Ross gets up from the table.)
196	Monica	 Excuse me, where are you going?
197	Ross	 Uh... to the bathroom.
198	Monica	 Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
199	Ross	 I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
200	Joey	 Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)
201	Rachel	 Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
202	Joey	 That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
203	Monica	 Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
204	Phoebe	 (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
205		(Ross comes back from bathroom.)
206	Ross	 Alright. (to Rachel)
207	Rachel	 Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)
208		(Time lapse.)
209	Phoebe	 You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
210	Chandler	 Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
211	Joey	 Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
212	Phoebe	 Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)
213	Rachel	 I'm in.
214	Monica	 Me too.
215	Joey	 Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
216	Ross	 Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down cards)
217	Rachel	 Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing)
218		(Ross stands up.)
219	Rachel	 And your fly's still open...
220		(Ross looks down.)
221	Rachel	 Ha, I made you look....
222		(Time lapse.)
223	Rachel	 I couldn't be inner. Monica?
224	Phoebe	 Monica, in or out?
225	Monica	 (slams down cards) I hate this game!
226		(Joey slides a plate away from Monica towards Chandler, who hides it under the table.)
227	Phoebe	 OK Joey, your bet.
228	Joey	 Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.
229	Phoebe	 Ross?
230	Ross	 Oh, I am very in.
231	Phoebe	 Chandler?
232	Chandler	 Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
233	Phoebe	 Me too. Rachel.
234	Rachel	 Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?
235	Ross	 No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
236	Rachel	 I'm not telling. (collects chips)
237	Ross	 Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)
238	Rachel	 No..!
239	Ross	 Show them to me!
240	Rachel	 Get your hands out of there! No!
241	Ross	 Let me see! Show them!
242	Chandler	 Y'know, I've had dates like this.
243	Rachel	 (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
244	Phoebe	 Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
245		(Ross is visibly upset.)
246	Ross	 First of all, I'm not losing...
247	Rachel	 Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)
248	Ross	 Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
249	Rachel	 (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
250	Ross	 (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
251	Rachel	 (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
252		(Rachel walks into kitchen to talk on the phone.)
253	Rachel	 Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
254		(Rachel goes back and sits down. The rest don't know what to say.)
255	Monica	 Sorry, Rach.
256	Phoebe	 Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
257	Rachel	 Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
258	Joey	 Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
259	Rachel	 Yes, we do. (pause)
260	Monica	 Alright, check.
261	Joey	 Check.
262	Ross	 I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
263	Chandler	 Call.
264	Phoebe	 I'm in.
265	Rachel	 I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it in)
266	Ross	 I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
267	Rachel	 Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
268		(Everyone says no and folds, except for Ross, who thinks about it.)
269	Rachel	 (to Ross)
270		(Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe back their chairs away from the table.)
271	Ross	 No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
272	Rachel	 What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
273		(Ross thinks it over, finally sits down and picks up his cards.)
274	Ross	 I'm in. (throws in chips)
275	Rachel	 How many you want?
276	Ross	 One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
277	Rachel	 Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
278	Ross	 I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
279	Rachel	 OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)
280	Ross	 I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
281		(The other four look amazed at the large pot.)
282	Rachel	 See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
283		(Monica gets up, looks in Rachel's purse.)
284	Monica	 Rachel, there's nothing in it.
285	Rachel	 OK, then get me your purse.
286		(Monica gets Rachel her purse.)
287	Monica	 OK, here you go. Good luck.
288	Rachel	 (to Monica)
289	Phoebe	 ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
290		(Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.)
291	Ross	 (to Joey)
292	Joey	 That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
293		(Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.)
294	Chandler	 (to Ross)
295	Ross	 Fifteen.
296	Chandler	 Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
297	Joey	 Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)
298	Ross	 Thank you.
299	Chandler	 Good luck.
300	Ross	 (to Rachel)
301		(Long pause as they both look at each other.)
302	Rachel	 (lays down cards) Full house.
303		(Ross stares at her. Thinks about it. Puts cards on table, face down.)
304	Ross	 You got me.
305		(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)
306	Joey	 (to Ross)
307	Chandler	 (to Ross)
308	Ross	 Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
309		(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)
310		Closing Credits
311	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing Pictionary at Monica's apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane.]
312	Chandler	 Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
313		(Timer goes off.)
314	Rachel	 Oh, time's up.
315	Monica	 (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
316	Joey	 Oh!
317	Phoebe	 That's a bird?
318		(Monica glares at Phoebe.)
319	Phoebe	 That's a bird!
320		(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)
321	Rachel	 OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)
322	Chandler	 Go.
323		(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)
324	Ross	 Uh.... bean! Bean!
325		(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)
326	Joey	 (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
327	Rachel	 Yes!
328	Monica	 That, you get? That, you get?
329		(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was about to throw it.)
