2	[Scene	 Joey and now Rachel's apartment, Joey has the fridge pulled out away from the wall and is in the process of pulling off the cooling grate behind it.]
3	Joey	 Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
4		(Rachel enters from her new room.)
5	Rachel	 Hi Joey, how ya doin’?
6	Joey	 Great! Roomie!
7	Rachel	 Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
8	Joey	 Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
9	Rachel	 I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
10	Joey	 Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?
11	Rachel	 That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.
12	Joey	 All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.
13	Rachel	 You’re jokin’ right?
14	Joey	 Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.
15	Rachel	 Thank God you’re pretty. (Exits.)

18	Rachel	 Hey!
19	All	 Hi! Hey!
20	Rachel	 Do you guys know any cute guys?
21	Chandler	 Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s arm, Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)
22	Joey	 Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.
23	Rachel	 Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…
24	Monica	 What’s the charity?
25	Rachel	 I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.
26	Monica	 Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?
27	Rachel	 Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
28	Phoebe	 Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
29	Rachel	 Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
30	Chandler	 So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
31	Joey	 Ooh! So close.
32		(Ross and Elizabeth enter.)
33	Ross	 Hey everybody!
34	All	 Hi!
35	Ross	 Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
36	Elizabeth	 Oh hi!
37	All	 Hi!
38	Elizabeth	 I’m the student.
39	Chandler	 (laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!
40	Phoebe	 Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
41	Elizabeth	 Oh, we’re not together.
42	Ross	 Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
43	Phoebe	 Oh, sly.
44	Elizabeth	 Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I’ll see you later?
45	All	 Okay!
46	Elizabeth	 Bye Ross.
47	Ross	 Bye.
48		(They kiss.)
49	Elizabeth	 Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
50	Ross	 Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)
51	Chandler	 So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
52	Ross	 Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
53	Chandler	 Oh, tell her good luck with that.
54	Ross	 Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
55	Rachel	 Oo! When’s her birthday?!
56	Ross	 I don’t know Rachel, why?
57	Rachel	 Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.
58	Monica	 Oh, I like Elizabeth.
59	Ross	 Well thanks!
60	Monica	 Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
61	Joey	 Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her?
62	Ross	 Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
63	Monica	 Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
64	Ross	 Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…
65	Phoebe	 (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
66	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is sitting at the table and Monica is doing something in the kitchen.]
67	Monica	 Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
68	Chandler	 Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
69	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
70	Monica	 Hey!
71	Phoebe	 Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
72	Chandler	 Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
73	Phoebe	 Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
74	Chandler	 Why would our guy be a weirdo?
75	Phoebe	 ‘Cause that’s just your taste.
76	Monica	 (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
77	Phoebe	 Oh yeah?
78	Monica	 Yeah!
79	Phoebe	 My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)
80	Chandler	 A face ass?
81	Phoebe	 A chin dimple!
82	Monica	 Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!
83	Phoebe	 Have you seen your guy’s body?
84	Chandler	 No, our guy is just a floating head.
85	Phoebe	 Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
86	Monica	 You’re not supposed to look!
87	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
88	Chandler	 (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
89	Phoebe	 I know. (Laughs.)
90	Monica	 All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
91	Phoebe	 Oh, Chandler funny?
92	Monica	 Our guy’s a great dancer!
93	Phoebe	 My guy is well read.
94	Chandler	 Our guy has great hair.
95	Phoebe	 My guy has great teeth!
96	Chandler	 Our guy smells incredible.
97	Monica	 (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?
98	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is entering to find Joey bingeing on the food from the fridge. Joey isn’t doing all that well.]
99	Chandler	 Hey.
100	Joey	 Huh.
101	Chandler	 Well, you…don’t look good Joe.
102	Joey	 The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?
103	Chandler	 That’s still in there?!
104	Joey	 Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
105	Chandler	 Is this a service you’re providing me?
106	Joey	 No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!
107	Chandler	 Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.
108	Joey	 So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
109	Chandler	 Uh-huh.
110	Joey	 And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
111	Chandler	 (not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried) Okay…
112	Joey	 (pause) Give me $400!
113	[Scene	 Ross’s office, he’s unlocking his office door as Elizabeth walks up.]
114	Elizabeth	 Professor Geller?
115	Ross	 Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’t know.
116	Elizabeth	 I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
117	Ross	 Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
118	Elizabeth	 Making out in your office.
119	Ross	 Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don’t we go inside?
120		(They go inside and Ross closes the door. When he turns around Elizabeth walks up to him, pushes him back against the door, and starts kissing him.)
121	Ross	 Oh-ooh!
122	Elizabeth	 What?
123	Ross	 Doorknob! Doorknob!
124	Elizabeth	 Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
125	Ross	 Oh, okay. What-what about?
126	Elizabeth	 Spring vacation.
127	Ross	 Spring vacation.
128	Elizabeth	 Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips…
129		(Another professor barges in.)
130	Professor Feesen	 Professor Geller!
131	Ross	 (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
132	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment, Ross, Chandler, and Joey are entering.]
133	Ross	 You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
134	Chandler	 Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
135	Ross	 I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
136	Chandler	 Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
137	Joey	 Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in Ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)
138	Ross	 What the hell are you doing?
139	Joey	 What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
140	Ross	 What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
141	Joey	 Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!
142	Chandler	 Joey, I saw you push him!
143	Joey	 (pause) You pushed him!
144	Ross	 Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
145	Joey	 All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
146	Chandler	 Uh-huh.
147	Joey	 I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.
148	Ross	 Do not give him any money!
149	Joey	 I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
150	[Scene	 Ross’s office, he’s opening the door to Elizabeth.]
151	Elizabeth	 You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
152	Ross	 Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
153		(She does so, he closes the door, and she pushes him against the doorknob again.)
154	Ross	 Oo-oo!
155	Elizabeth	 Doorknob?
156	Ross	 Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
157	Elizabeth	 Oh good.
158	Ross	 Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
159	Elizabeth	 Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.
160	Ross	 No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
161	Elizabeth	 You are so adorable.
162	Ross	 That! Let’s talk about that.
163	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]
164	Ross	 Hey!
165	Chandler	 Hey!
166	Phoebe	 Hey!
167	Monica	 Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
168	Ross	 Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.
169	Chandler	 Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
170	Ross	 What’s-what’s the difference?
171	Monica	 Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.
172	Ross	 Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
173	Phoebe	 What did you do on yours?
174	Ross	 I went to Egypt with my dad.
175	Chandler	 I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!" (Does that party noise again.)
176	Ross	 Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!
177	Monica	 And slept with the professor.
178	Ross	 I’m gonna call her.
179	Chandler	 Yeah.
180		(Ross leaves to do so and Rachel enters with a guy.)
181	Rachel	 Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
182	Sebastian	 Hi.
183	Rachel	 We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.
184	Sebastian	 Can I get you a cup of coffee?
185	Rachel	 Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
186	Phoebe	 Rachel, what the hell is this?!
187	Rachel	 (shocked) What?
188	Phoebe	 You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
189	Rachel	 You found me a guy?
190	Monica	 Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!
191	Phoebe	 Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
192	Rachel	 Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
193	Chandler	 Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
194	Monica	 Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
195		(Sebastian returns with the coffee.)
196	Sebastian	 Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)
197	Rachel	 Oh, thank you.
198	Sebastian	 Sure.
199	Phoebe	 So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
200	Sebastian	 Uh, no not really. Why?
201	Phoebe	 No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
202	Chandler	 Are you funny?
203	Sebastian	 Excuse me?
204	Rachel	 What are you guys doing?
205	Monica	 Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
206	Sebastian	 Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
207	Phoebe	 Well, so do a lot of people.
208	Sebastian	 Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call sometime.
209	Rachel	 Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.
210	Sebastian	 Okay! See you later! (Exits.)
211	Chandler	 (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
212		Commercial Break
213	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
214	Rachel	 I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
215	Chandler	 Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?
216	Phoebe	 Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okay—I gotta go!"
217	Monica	 All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
218	Phoebe	 Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
219	Rachel	 All right.
220	Chandler	 Okay, so you will meet our guys?
221	Rachel	 Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.
222	Chandler	 Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
223	Joey	 (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
224	Phoebe	 Okay sure!
225	Joey	 Really?!
226	Phoebe	 Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
227	Joey	 Call it even?
228	Phoebe	 Okay.
229		(Ross returns.)
230	Chandler	 (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
231	Ross	 Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know…
232	Joey	 Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
233	Chandler	 You know the hotels?
234	Joey	 Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!
235	Monica	 In 1981 you were 13!
236	Joey	 So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
237	Ross	 Okay, she can’t go.
238	Phoebe	 Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.
239	Ross	 Then what am I supposed to do?
240	Phoebe	 Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
241	Ross	 Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
242	Chandler	 Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.
243	[Scene	 Elizabeth’s apartment, she is packing for her trip as Ross watches.]
244	Ross	 I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
245	Elizabeth	 Yeah! I’ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y’know, blow off some steam.
246	Ross	 Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
247	Elizabeth	 What?
248	Ross	 Are you into crafts at all?
249	Elizabeth	 Ross, are you okay?
250	Ross	 Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
251	Elizabeth	 It’s a bathing suit?
252	Ross	 To wear in front of people?
253	Elizabeth	 Is that supportive?
254	Ross	 Is this?!
255	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is reading as Monica and Chandler enter.]
256	Monica	 Hey!
257	Chandler	 Good-good-good-good.
258	Monica	 Hey!
259	Chandler	 Hey!
260	Rachel	 Hi!
261	Monica	 We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.
262	Rachel	 Oh…
263	Monica	 You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
264	Rachel	 I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.
265	Chandler	 Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)
266	Rachel	 What?
267	Monica	 Eldad, this is Rachel.
268	Eldad	 How are you?
269	Rachel	 Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
270	Chandler	 Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!
271	Rachel	 I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)
272	Chandler	 There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
273	Monica	 Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!
274	Phoebe	 This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
275	Patrick	 Hi.
276	Chandler	 Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.
277	Phoebe	 (looks) Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?
278	Rachel	 Yeah?
279	Phoebe	 This is Patrick.
280	Rachel	 Oh, hi.
281	Patrick	 Hi.
282	Phoebe	 Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
283	Rachel	 Yeah?
284	Phoebe	 Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.
285	Rachel	 Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
286	Phoebe	 Yeah?
287	Rachel	 I’m just sort of in the middle of something.
288	Phoebe	 Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)
289	Monica	 No! You can’t do that!
290	Eldad	 Maybe I should go!
291	Monica	 (stopping him) Sit down! We’re winning!
292	Rachel	 Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!
293	All	 (Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
294	Monica	 Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!
295	Chandler	 It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
296	Rachel	 Yeah, I’m good.
297	Phoebe	 Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
298	Patrick	 Y’know what Phoebe? This isn’t really worth the free massage.
299	Monica	 That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!
300	Chandler	 (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!
301		(He starts to get up, but Rachel stops him.)
302	Rachel	 No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?
303	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out.
304	Rachel	 I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
305	Eldad	 I’m a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)
306	Rachel	 I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
307	Phoebe	 Then why did she ask us to…
308	Rachel	 I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
309	Eldad	 Yes, Papaya Extract.
310	Rachel	 Thank you! (Storms out.)
311	[Scene	 The airport, Elizabeth’s flight is about to leave and Ross is there to send her off.]
312	Ross	 So uh, have a great time down there.
313	Elizabeth	 I will.
314	Ross	 Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
315	Elizabeth	 Yeah.
316	Ross	 It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.
317	Elizabeth	 Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.
318	Ross	 Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.
319	Elizabeth	 Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
320	Ross	 Really?
321	Elizabeth	 Yeah! I’m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
322	Ross	 Okay. Cool.
323	Elizabeth	 Oh hey! Here they are!
324		(A group of about 10 guys and no women come running around the corner.)
325	Guy	 Elizabeth!
326		(The guys pick up Elizabeth and carry her onto the plane as she waves bye.)
327	Ross	 Call me!
328		Ending Credits
329	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are there.]
330	Phoebe	 Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.
331	Rachel	 Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
332	Chandler	 So what was it for anyway?
333	Rachel	 I wanna say a disease.
334	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
335	All	 Hey!
336	Joey	 I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
337	Rachel	 Huh. All right.
338		(Rachel does so and it’s one of those dance party shows they have during spring break and we see…)
339	Phoebe	 Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!
340		(Suddenly Ross jumps in and starts dancing with her.)
341	Rachel	 Oh-oh Professor Geller.
342	Joey	 Ahh, to be 13 again.
343	Chandler	 Yeah.
