3	Joey	 (sees Rachel) Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing?
4	Rachel	 Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
5	Joey	 Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!
6		(Chandler and Monica enter from their room and Joey quickly hides the bag of potato chips behind his back.)
7	Monica	 Joey we know you steal our food.
8		(Joey offers them some potato chips.)
9	Chandler	 I’m good.
10	Monica	 (To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
11	Rachel	 Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
12	Chandler	 (looking) Is that a swing?
13	Rachel	 Oh don’t even ask!
14	Chandler	 Yuck!
15	Joey	 I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
16	Chandler	 That was like 5 years ago.
17	Joey	 Yeah you got 5 years left!
18	Chandler	 Joey…
19	Joey	 You wanna make it 6?!
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is on the couch reading as Rachel enters. It’s the next day.]
22	Rachel	 Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
23	Ross	 Hey!
24	Rachel	 (to Gunther) I’ll take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date last night?
25	Ross	 Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
26	Rachel	 Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
27	Ross	 I guess so.
28	Rachel	 So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
29	Ross	 No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
30	Rachel	 Oh, slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened.
31	Ross	 Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
32	Rachel	 Right. Was it the, "Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
33	Ross	 Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
34	Rachel	 She asked-asked you out again?
35	Ross	 Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
36	Rachel	 Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.
37	Ross	 (while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. (Rachel stops.) It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again.
38	Rachel	 Thank you. I…yeah.
39	Ross	 I mean after tomorrow night.
40	Rachel	 No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it! (Starts to freak out.) It’s just gonna freak me out!!!
41	Ross	 Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
42	Rachel	 Ross thanks.
43	Ross	 You want me to call her right now?
44	Rachel	 Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?
45	Ross	 Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
46	Rachel	 Yeah do it now, call right now.
47	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey are watching ET.]
48	Monica	 (crying) This is my favorite part.
49	Phoebe	 (crying) Yeah me too.
50		(We see the TV and it’s the last scene where ET is saying goodbye.)
51	Phoebe	 Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
52	Chandler	 (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
53	Joey	 (crying) You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?
54	Chandler	 Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
55	Monica	 Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.
56	Chandler	 I’m not macho.
57	Monica	 Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.
58	Chandler	 No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
59	Joey	 Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
60	Chandler	 I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.
61	Joey	 Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
62	Chandler	 Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!
63	Monica	 Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
64		(Chandler starts paging through the album.)
65	Phoebe	 All right, what’s going on there? (Points to a picture.)
66	Chandler	 Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
67	Monica	 Where were your parents?
68	Chandler	 Oh they didn’t want to come!
69	Phoebe	 Oh Chandler!
70	Monica	 Poor thing!
71	Phoebe	 So that story doesn’t make you cry?
72	Chandler	 No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!
73	Joey	 No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!
74	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is putting away her guitar as a man approaches.]
75	The Fan	 Excuse me.
76	Phoebe	 Yeah?
77	The Fan	 Are you Phoebe Buffay?
78	Phoebe	 Yeah.
79	The Fan	 Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan. (Holds out a napkin and a pen.)
80	Phoebe	 Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! (Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)
81	The Fan	 Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented.
82	Phoebe	 You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. (The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (Points) He’s a fan. (To the fan as she’s leaving) Bye! (Exits)
83	Joey	 (to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
84	The Fan	 I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph!
85	Joey	 Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!
86	The Fan	 Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies.
87	Joey	 Movies?
88	The Fan	 That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
89	Joey	 (laughs) I don’t think so.
90	The Fan	 No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this! (Exits.)
91	Joey	 Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!
92	Gunther	 Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
93	[Scene	 Central Perk, time lapse, Rachel is at the counter as Jill enters.]
94	Jill	 Hey!
95	Rachel	 Hey!
96	Jill	 You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!
97	Rachel	 Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
98	Jill	 Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.
99	Rachel	 It’s not random, it’s Bob.
100	Jill	 It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
101	Rachel	 No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
102	Jill	 You asked him too?!
103	Rachel	 Hm-mmm.
104	Jill	 Why?!
105	Rachel	 Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
106	Jill	 I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
107	Rachel	 No.
108	Jill	 You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?
109	Rachel	 (changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
110	Jill	 Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!
111	Rachel	 Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…
112	Jill	 Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
113	Rachel	 I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
114	Jill	 Why are you so jealous of me?
115	Rachel	 Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
116	Jill	 Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy! (Starts to storm out.)
117	Rachel	 All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
118	Jill	 Who?!
119	Rachel	 In Human Resources!!!!!!
120	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is ranting about Jill to Chandler and Monica.]
121	Rachel	 …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
122	Monica	 You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?
123	Rachel	 Do I have my own castle?
124		(Joey and Ross enter.)
125	Ross	 Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?
126	Rachel	 No.
127	Monica	 (noticing the bag Joey’s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?
128	Joey	 Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.
129	Chandler	 You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
130		(Joey and Ross exchange looks.)
131	Joey	 Sort of…
132	Monica	 Guys, what’s going on?
133	Joey	 (holds up the movie) Phoebe’s a porn star!
134	All	 What?!!
135		(They all run over to Joey and Ross, Chandler grabs the movie and reads the title.)
136	Chandler	 Phoebe Buffay in Buffay
137	Rachel	 Oh my God!
138	Monica	 That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?
139	Joey	 Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
140	Ross	 And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)
141	Rachel	 Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.
142	Monica	 This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.
143	Chandler	 Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.
144	Monica	 Yes, but you are dead inside.
145	Joey	 All right well, I’d better take that back.
146	Monica	 Wh-what, why?
147	Joey	 We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!
148	Monica	 Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.
149	Rachel	 Absolutely not.
150	Monica	 (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn’t let him grab it) Y’know maybe a little bit!
151	Rachel	 Probably just the first half.
152	Joey	 No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it!
153	Ross	 Yeah! Good for you Joe!
154	Joey	 Yeah.
155		(Ross stands next to him for a second, then goes and watches the movie.)
156		(The movie starts, it’s a vampire’s lair and Buffay, The Vampire Layer enters dressed in leather and carrying a wooden stake. Suddenly, the vampire opens his coffin and sits up.
157	Buffay, the Vampire Layer	 Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool.
158	The Vampire	 Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
159	Buffay, the Vampire Layer	 Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
160		(At this point, Buffay, the Vampire Layer and Nasforatool start to get it on. Of course, since this is network TV, we can only see the reactions of the gang to the film playing off screen.)
161	Monica	 Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
162	Chandler	 Her ankle is what you’re watching?
163	Rachel	 Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
164	Chandler	 She’s just doing her job!
165	Joey	 (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!
166	Rachel	 Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!
167		(Upon hearing this, Joey can’t turn his chair around fast enough and knocks it over.)
168	Joey	 Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
169	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
170		Commercial Break
171	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is reading Chicken Soup for the Soul as Monica enters.]
172	Monica	 Hey sweetie!
173	Chandler	 Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
174	Monica	 (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?
175	Chandler	 There’s no back to this couch!
176	Monica	 Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
177	Chandler	 Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.
178	Monica	 Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.
179	Chandler	 Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
180	Monica	 Stop it!
181	Chandler	 No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)
182	Monica	 I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)
183	Chandler	 Yeah?
184	Monica	 Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.
185	Chandler	 Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.
186	Monica	 And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.
187	Chandler	 Aww, I love you so…
188	Monica	 What is wrong with you?!!!
189	Chandler	 What?!
190	Monica	 What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
191	Chandler	 So you didn’t mean any of that?!
192	Monica	 No you robot!!
193	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, his doorbell is ringing and he’s running to answer it while doing up his pants.]
194	Ross	 You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to… (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?
195	Jill	 Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
196	Ross	 Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)
197	Jill	 (entering) I don’t want to talk about it.
198	Ross	 Okay, umm…
199	Jill	 But you know what might really cheer me up?
200	Ross	 What?
201	Jill	 Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
202	Ross	 Wow! Really?!
203	Jill	 Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
204	Ross	 Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!
205	Jill	 Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!
206	Ross	 Ohh!
207		(He goes into another room to get his projector and notes. While he’s gone, Jill quickly checks her makeup.
208		[Cut to Monica and Chandler’s, Rachel is entering.]
209	Rachel	 Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.
210	Monica	 No, I haven’t.
211	Rachel	 Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.
212		(She goes to look out the window at Ross’s apartment and sees Jill staring at her and closing the drapes with an evil look on her face. Rachel is stunned into silence.)
213	[Scene	 Ursula’s apartment, Phoebe is going to confront her twin about her new porn career.]
214	Ursula	 Who is it?
215	Phoebe	 It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
216		(Ursula opens the door and is all dressed up with big hair and lingerie.)
217	Ursula	 Hey!
218	Phoebe	 (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
219	Ursula	 No I’m not.
220		(Someone calls out from her apartment.)
221	Man’s Voice	 We’re still rolling!
222	Phoebe	 You’re making one right now!
223	Another Man’s Voice	 Let’s go Phoebe!
224	Phoebe	 And-and you’re using my name!
225	Ursula	 Yeah, can I help you with something?
226	Same Man’s Voice	 Phoebe, come on!
227	Phoebe	 Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
228	Ursula	 Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
229	Phoebe	 What?!
230	Ursula	 Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
231	Phoebe	 No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.)
232	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross is setting up for the slide show.]
233	Ross	 Slides are almost ready.
234	Jill	 Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
235	Ross	 Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.
236	Jill	 Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)
237	Ross	 (answering it) Hello?
238	Rachel	 (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
239	Ross	 O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.
240	Rachel	 Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
241	Ross	 So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
242	Rachel	 Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
243	Ross	 Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
244	Jill	 So? (Kisses him passionately.)
245	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is reading a paper as Phoebe enters.]
246	Phoebe	 Hey!
247	Joey	 Hey!
248	Phoebe	 So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
249	Joey	 Oh no, not you too!
250	Phoebe	 No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
251	Joey	 Nice!
252	Phoebe	 Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
253	Joey	 That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?
254	Phoebe	 Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
255	Joey	 You do?
256	Phoebe	 Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey) See?
257	Joey	 Yeah.
258	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, time lapse, Ross is entering. Chandler and Monica are at the kitchen table. Rachel is on the couch reading.]
259	Chandler	 Hey.
260	Ross	 (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
261	Rachel	 Oh! I knew it! What happened?
262	Ross	 Umm, she kissed me.
263	Rachel	 What?! You kissed!
264	Chandler	 (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
265	Monica	 (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!
266	Ross	 Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
267	Rachel	 Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
268	Ross	 Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
269	Rachel	 Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
270	Ross	 Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
271	Rachel	 Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
272	Ross	 Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
273	Rachel	 What?!
274	Ross	 No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
275	Rachel	 Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)
276	Ross	 You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
277		(Chandler starts crying.)
278	Monica	 Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
279	Chandler	 (crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!
280		Ending Credits
281	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there as Jill enters.]
282	Jill	 All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!
283	Rachel	 Yeah, I got that.
284	Jill	 (To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
285	Ross	 You take care Jill.
286	Jill	 (happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
287	Rachel	 Bye-bye-e!
288	Monica	 Bye.
289	Chandler	 (starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They all look at him.) I can’t help it, I opened a gate.
