3	Rachel	 Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing (a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the table) Oh my Goood, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. (hangs up) OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. (grabs a pot and lid) OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. (puts pot over the pigeon) Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. (knock at the door) It's open you guys.

12		Opening Credits
13	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there.]
14	Joey	 This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
15	Phoebe	 Well, I mean, I'm not married, married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
16	Monica	 I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
17	Phoebe	 I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
18	Monica	 Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
19	Ross	 You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
20	Phoebe	 OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
21	Monica	 Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
22	All	 Huuh.
23	Monica	 Well, didn't you?
24	Phoebe	 I might have.
25	Monica	 I can't believe you didn't tell me.
26	Phoebe	 Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
27	Monica	 What have I not told you?
28	Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
29	Rachel	 What!
30		(Rachel, Joey, Ross, and Phoebe run over to the window to look.)
31	Monica	 Wait a minute, who told you? (turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish) You are dead meat.
32	Chandler	 I didn't know it was a big secret.
33	Monica	 Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple!
34		(Everyone comes back from the window and surrounds Chandler with Ross hopping on the couch.)
35	Phoebe	 You have a third nipple?
36	Chandler	 (to Monica) You bitch.
37	Ross	 Whip it out, whip it out.
38	Phoebe	 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
39	Chandler	 (walks into the living room) C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
40	Rachel	 Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
41	Joey	 I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
42	Ross	 Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
43	Joey	 I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
44		(They go over to Chandler.)
45	All	 Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
46	Chandler	 Joey was in a porno movie.
47	All	 Huuh.
48	Chandler	 If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
49		(They all run over to Joey.)
50	Ross	 You were in a porno?
51	Joey	 Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
52	Monica	 That is wild.
53	Ross	 (to Chandler) So what's it shaped like?
54	Phoebe	 Yeah, is there a hair on it?
55	Joey	 What happens if you flick it?
56	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Julie are sitting on the couch.]
57	Ross	 So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
58	Chandler	 Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
59	Julie	 You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
60	Chandler	 Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
61	Ross	 You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
62	Rachel	 (to Monica at the counter) Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
63	Monica	 Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
64	Rachel	 Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
65		(Phoebe enters all dressed up)
66	All	 Woah.
67	Joey	 Foxy lady.
68	Julie	 Where you goin'?
69	Phoebe	 Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
70	Joey	 The Ice Capades?
71	Chandler	 No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
72	Monica	 I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
73	Phoebe	 OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
74	Ross	 (holding cream pitcher) Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. (holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid) Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
75	Chandler	 Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
76	[Scene	 Central Perk, close to closing. Ross and Julie are still there. Rachel is cleaning tables.]
77	Ross	 OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
78	Julie	 See you later Rach.
79	Rachel	 Bye-bye Julie. (Julie leaves)
80		(Rachel is still cleaning, Ross is laying on the couch. Ross kicks Rachel in the butt.)
81	Rachel	 Hey.
82	Ross	 Hey.
83		(Ross kicks her again)
84	Rachel	 Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
85	Ross	 Hey?
86	Rachel	 What?
87	Ross	 Can I ask you somethin'?
88	Rachel	 Sure.
89	Ross	 Naa.
90	Rachel	 What? C'mon, talk to me.
91	Ross	 OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
92	Rachel	 Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
93	Ross	 Technically, huh, no.
94	Rachel	 Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
95	Ross	 No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
96	Rachel	 No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
97	Ross	 It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
98	Rachel	 No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
99	Ross	 What?
100	Rachel	 I think it's sexy.
101	Ross	 Sexy?
102	Rachel	 Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
103	Ross	 No kidding?
104	Rachel	 Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
105	Ross	 What?
106	Rachel	 I'd wait.
107	Ross	 You'd wait?
108	Rachel	 Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
109	Ross	 Really?
110	Rachel	 Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
111	Ross	 Women really want this?
112	Rachel	 More than jewelry. (Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself)
113	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room.]
114	Phoebe	 Hi.
115	Duncan	 Phoebe!
116	Phoebe	 Ta-da.
117	Duncan	 Hey.
118	Phoebe	 Hi.
119	Duncan	 Ahh, look at you, you look great.
120	Phoebe	 Do I? Thank you, so do you.
121	Duncan	 Thanks.
122	Phoebe	 Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
123	Duncan	 You always said I'd make it.
124	Phoebe	 Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
125	Duncan	 I missed you. (they hug) I'm gonna get changed.
126	Phoebe	 OK.
127	Duncan	 Um, now. Phoebs.
128	Phoebe	 Oh, right, OK. Ole.
129	Duncan	 What?
130	Phoebe	 Um, the matador. (Duncan leaves) Ole, ha ha ha.
131	[Scene	 Ross's apartment. Ross and Julie are setting the table.]
132	Ross	 Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. (hands her a bowl and kisses her)
133		(Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel enter. Ross and Julie don't notice.)
134	Chandler	 Uh, Julie.
135	Julie	 Yeah?
136	Chandler	 Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
137	Ross	 Hi everyone.
138	All	 Hi.
139	Ross	 (pulls Rachel aside) I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
140	Rachel	 Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
141	Ross	 Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
142	Rachel	 What did, what did he say?
143	Ross	 Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
144	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, after dinner. Chandler enters.]
145	Chandler	 What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
146	Ross	 Pop it in.
147	Joey	 I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. (Chandler puts the tape in)
148	Rachel	 Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
149	Ross	 What's wrong with people having sex?
150	Rachel	 Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
151	Monica	 Hell, I wanna see Joey.
152		(The video starts with the cheesy porn disco music)
153	Julie	 So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
154	Chandler	 OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
155	Monica	 All I say is, she better get the job.
156	Ross	 Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
157	Joey	 Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad for the paper tray.
158	Chandler	 Nice work my friend.
159	Joey	 Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
160	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is fixing her hair and Duncan enters.]
161	Phoebe	 So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
162	Duncan	 Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
163	Phoebe	 Ohh. . .K. How come?
164	Duncan	 Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
165	Phoebe	 What?
166	Duncan	 Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
167	Phoebe	 Huuh.
168	Duncan	 Yeah, I know, I.
169	Phoebe	 I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
170	Duncan	 I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
171	Phoebe	 So how long have you known?
172	Duncan	 Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
173	Phoebe	 And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
174	Duncan	 Her name's Debra.
175	Phoebe	 Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
176	Duncan	 Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
177	Phoebe	 Sure.
178	Duncan	 But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
179	Phoebe	 I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
180	Duncan	 I'm, I'm still me.
181	Phoebe	 Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
182	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, everyone is sitting around. Monica enters from bathroom.]
183	Monica	 You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
184	Julie	 That saves us a conversation.
185	Chandler	 Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
186	Joey	 Me too, we should get goin'.
187	Rachel	 No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
188	Monica	 Rachel, that's all we do.
189	Rachel	 Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
190	Julie	 What about Julie?
191	Rachel	 Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
192	Julie	 Well, that could take a while.
193	Rachel	 So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
194	Chandler	 I got the time to get to know Julie.
195	Joey	 I got time.
196	Monica	 Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? (Rachel gives her a look from hell) That's fine.
197	Rachel	 OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
198	Julie	 Well, in a nutshell. . .
199	Rachel	 Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
200	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is signing the divorce papers.]
201	Phoebe	 So, um, have you told your parents?
202	Duncan	 No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
203	Phoebe	 (handing him the papers) Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
204	Duncan	 I love you Phoebe. (they hug and kiss)
205	Phoebe	 So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
206	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Julie is telling her life story.]
207	Julie	 And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
208	Rachel	 Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
209	Julie	 No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
210	Rachel	 Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
211	Chandler	 I'm goin' home.
212	Rachel	 What?
213		(Outside in the hallway, Chandler, Joey, and Monica exit)
214	Joey	 Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
215	Ross	 Good-night.
216	Rachel	 So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
217	Ross	 Oh, no-no, I am.
218	Rachel	 Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
219	Ross	 Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
220	Rachel	 Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
221	Ross	 I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
222	Rachel	 OK, gook luck.
223	Ross	 Wha, uhh, what?
224	Rachel	 Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
225	Ross	 OK, now I'm nervous.
226	Rachel	 Maybe you should put it off.
227	Ross	 No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
228	Rachel	 I know, yeah, sorry.
229	Ross	 What, it's not your fault.
230	Rachel	 Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
231	Ross	 Really?
232	Rachel	 Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
233	Ross	 (being drawn in by her talk) Uh-huh.
234	Rachel	 And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
235	Ross	 Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. (goes back in apartment)
236	Rachel	 Ohh, God.
