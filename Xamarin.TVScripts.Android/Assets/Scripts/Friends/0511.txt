2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are hosting a New Year's party. So the place is crowded and in a shameless promotion for NBC they're watching Jay Leno's coverage of New Year's from Time Square.]
3	Jay Leno	 (On TV to Dick Clark) Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
4	Joey	 All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
5	Chandler	 (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
6	Joey	 What's the matter?!
7	Chandler	 We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know…
8	Joey	 All right, I'll take care of it.
9	Monica	 Oh no, wait! Joey!
10		(They try to stop him, not sure of what he's planning. He ignores them and goes to talk to Ross.)
11	Ross	 (hopping) 73! 72! 71!
12	Joey	 Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
13	Ross	 What?
14	Joey	 Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
15	Ross	 Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
16	Joey	 Chandler.
17	Ross	 Awww, man! Really?
18	Joey	 Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
19	Ross	 That's a good point.
20	Joey	 Yeah.
21	Ross	 Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
22	Joey	 Okay, great!
23	Ross	 All right.
24	Joey	 Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
25	Phoebe	 It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
26	Joey	 Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
27	Rachel	 What?!
28	Ross	 Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
29	Rachel	 So?
30	Joey	 So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
31	Rachel	 Oh, good point.
32	Joey	 Yeah!
33	All	 (watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
34		(And with that everyone starts playing tonsil hockey. Chandler with Monica, Ross with Phoebe, and Joey with Rachel.)
35	Chandler	 (To Monica) Happy New Year!
36	Monica	 Happy New Year.
37	Ross	 (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!
38	Phoebe	 You too!
39	Rachel	 (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!
40	Joey	 So did that do anything for ya?
41		(Rachel slowly walks away.)
42		Opening Credits
43	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, after the party. Everyone has left, except for the gang.]
44	Ross	 Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
45	Rachel	 But your divorce isn't even final yet.
46	Ross	 Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
47	Chandler	 Do you want us to leave the room, or?
48	Ross	 Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
49	Phoebe	 Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
50	Chandler	 That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
51	Phoebe	 Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
52	Monica	 She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
53	Ross	 In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
54	Chandler	 I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!
55	Joey	 All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
56	Ross	 Ohh.
57	Phoebe	 Really?! How come?
58	Joey	 Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
59	Phoebe	 Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
60	Joey	 Really? Who-who have you taught?
61	Phoebe	 Well, I taught me and I love me.
62	Joey	 Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
63	Rachel	 Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
64	Monica	 Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
65	Rachel	 I don't gossip!
66		(They all laugh.)
67	Rachel	 Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
68	Monica	 Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
69	Rachel	 What? They were like this!
70		(She puts her hands over her breasts and indicates that the coworkers boob job resulted in one pointing up and one pointing down with her hands by pointing up with one hand and down with the other.)
71	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is talking to a beautiful woman as Chandler and Joey enter.]
72	Woman	 I'll see you tomorrow.
73	Ross	 Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!
74	Chandler and Joey	 Hey!
75	Ross	 I just asked that girl out.
76	Chandler	 Nice!
77	Joey	 Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
78	Ross	 Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)
79	Chandler	 (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
80	Ross	 That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
81	Chandler	 Horn-swoggle.
82	Joey	 You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
83	Chandler	 No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)
84	Joey	 Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.)
85	Ross	 Hi, Pheebs!
86	Phoebe	 Hey!
87	Ross	 Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's ear.) Hornswoggle.
88	Phoebe	 Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.
89	Ross	 All right, see you later.
90	Joey	 See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
91	Phoebe	 Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)
92	Joey	 Umm, okay.
93	Phoebe	 Okay, lesson one
94	Chandler	 What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
95	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with Rachel.]
96	Phoebe	 Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
97	Rachel	 I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)
98	Joey	 Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)
99	Phoebe	 Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
100	Joey	 Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…
101	Phoebe	 Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
102	Joey	 No.
103	Phoebe	 Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
104	Joey	 Yes!
105	Phoebe	 Then don't touch one!!
106	Ross	 (entering, with Ben) Hi!
107	Ben	 Hi!
108	Monica	 Hi Ben!
109	Ben	 Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)
110	Chandler	 (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!
111	Rachel	 I think they're very nice.
112	Monica	 I like 'em.
113	Joey	 Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
114	Monica	 I like them a lot.
115	Chandler	 That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.
116		(They all speak at once in general approval of his pants selection; Joey asks where he got them. I can't pick out the rest of it.)
117	Ross	 Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
118		(No one says anything.)
119	Chandler	 Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
120	Ross	 (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?
121	Joey	 You look like a freak.
122	Rachel	 Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)
123		(Monica starts taking pictures of Ross and Ben, with the flash.)
124	Ross	 What are you, what are you doing?
125	Monica	 It's my New Year's resolution!
126	Ross	 What, to blind my child?
127	Monica	 No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
128	Joey	 Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
129	[Scene	 Elizabeth Hornswoggle's apartment; Ross is there on his date with her. They are sitting on the couch watching a movie. Ross is obviously hot.]
130	Ross	 (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?
131	Elizabeth Hornswoggle	 No.
132	Ross	 Okay, it must just be me then.
133		(He shifts on the couch and a ripping sound emanates from his lower regions, the sound reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. In other words, it sounds like he farted. She has a look of horrific wonderment, wondering "Did he just fart?")
134	Ross	 That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
135	Elizabeth	 No, go ahead.
136	Ross	 Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)
137		[Cut to Elizabeth Hornswoggle's bathroom, Ross frantically pulls his shirt out and drops his pants. He exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his legs. He sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. He next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he wants it to. So he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. He jumps up and hops to the sink. He turns on the water and starts to splash some on his legs, cooling them further.]
138	Ross	 (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
139	Elizabeth	 (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
140	Ross	 'Kay!
141		(He goes to pull up his pants, but can't seem to get them past his knees. He frantically tries to pull them up to no avail. Panic sets in.)
142	Ross	 Oh my God!
143	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is drilling Joey on the chords as Monica looks on.]
144	Phoebe	 Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
145	Joey	 Yes! Yes, I did.
146	Phoebe	 Then do Iceberg!
147	Joey	 (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
148	Phoebe	 G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!
149	Joey	 What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
150	Phoebe	 No, but you're questioning my method!
151	Joey	 No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
152	Monica	 Thank you. (Leaves.)
153	Phoebe	 Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
154	Joey	 Your other student, was you!
155	Phoebe	 Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
156	Joey	 (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)
157	Phoebe	 Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
158	Rachel	 (entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
159	Phoebe	 Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
160		(Rachel looks shocked, gets over it, notices she's alone, and picks up the phone. The last part of which is something she shouldn't have done, because the phone is already in use. By Monica, and now Rachel can hear every word.)
161	Monica	 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
162	Chandler	 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
163	Monica	 (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…
164	Rachel	 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
165		Commercial Break
166	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, The phone rings and Joey answers it.]
167	Joey	 (answering phone) Hello?
168	Ross	 (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
169	Joey	 Uhh, Chandler's not here.
170	Ross	 Well, you can help me!
171	Joey	 Okay.
172	Ross	 Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…
173	Joey	 Nice!
174	Ross	 No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
175	Joey	 Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
176	Ross	 Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)
177	Joey	 Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
178	Ross	 Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.) They're not coming on man.
179	Joey	 Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?
180	Ross	 Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
181	Joey	 Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
182	Ross	 Hold on.
183		(Ross proceeds to apply copious amounts of the lotion on his legs. He literally starts spraying the back of his legs with the lotion, and as he applies some to his butt he makes a happy face like he enjoyed that sensation. After using about half the bottle he again tries to pull up his pants, but at the first sign of resistance, his hand slips off of the pants and hits him in the forehead.)
184	Joey	 Ross? You okay?
185	Ross	 They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
186	Joey	 Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
187	Ross	 What difference does that make?!
188	Joey	 Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
189	Rachel	 (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?
190	Ross	 Dude, what am I gonna…
191	Joey	 (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
192	Rachel	 Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
193	Joey	 Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
194	Rachel	 Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
195	Joey	 What-what is it, what is it?
196	Rachel	 Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
197	Joey	 Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
198	Rachel	 Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
199	Joey	 I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
200	Rachel	 What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
201	Joey	 And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
202	Rachel	 I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)
203	Joey	 I'm not listening to you!
204		(Chandler seeing that Joey has his eyes closed sneaks over and picks up the chicken. The chicken starts flapping it's wings in protest as Chandler holds the chicken inches from Joey's face. Joey stops yelling and upon opening his eyes sees the chicken, screams, and falls to the ground in horror.)
205	[Scene	 Elizabeth's apartment; Elizabeth is inquiring as to the delay in Ross's exit from her bathroom.]
206	Elizabeth	 Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
207	Ross	 All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
208	Elizabeth	 No, let's just leave the lights on.
209		(Ross opens the door and steps into the living room. He has fully removed his pants and holds them wrapped into a ball in front of his crotch. His legs are covered in the powder and lotion paste. He looks terrible.)
210	Elizabeth	 Oh my God!
211	Ross	 I had a problem.
212	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is there to apologize to Phoebe.]
213	Joey	 Hey, Pheebs?
214	Phoebe	 No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
215	Joey	 Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?
216	Phoebe	 Uh-huh!
217	Joey	 Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
218	Joey	 (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right…
219	Phoebe	 No!
220	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his horrible trek back home without pants on. The whole gang is there.]
221	Chandler	 Oh my God!
222	Monica	 We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
223	Ross	 This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
224	All	 No. No, you're not a loser.
225	Ross	 Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
226	Monica	 Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
227	Ross	 Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
228	Monica	 See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
229		(All at once.)
230	Phoebe	 Yeah!
231	Rachel	 That really is something; that's really cool.
232	Joey	 Howdy partner!
233	Ross	 Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
234	Monica	 Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
235	Chandler	 Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
236		(They both exit.)
237	Phoebe	 Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
238	Rachel	 Good luck, honey!
239	Phoebe	 Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
240	Rachel	 Hey, uh, Joey?
241	Joey	 Umm?
242	Rachel	 Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
243	Joey	 Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)
244	Rachel	 I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
245	Joey	 Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
246	Rachel	 (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
247	Joey	 Now? You want me to go over there now?
248	Rachel	 Yeah!
249	Joey	 Do you know something?
250	Rachel	 Do you know something?
251	Joey	 I might know something.
252	Rachel	 I might know something too.
253	Joey	 What's the thing you know?
254	Rachel	 Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
255	Joey	 I can't tell you what I know.
256	Rachel	 Well then I can't tell you what I know.
257	Joey	 Okay, fine.
258		(Silence ensues.)
259	Joey	 You don't know!
260	Rachel	 All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (Note
261	Joey	 (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
262	Rachel	 AND YOU KNOW!!!
263	Joey	 Yeah, I know!!!!
264	Rachel	 Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
265	Joey	 Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen… (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
266	Joey and Rachel	 Hey!
267	Phoebe	 Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…
268		(Pause.)
269	Joey	 Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
270	Rachel	 Ohhh, yeah, me too.
271		(They both exit.)
272	Phoebe	 That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.
273		Ending Credits
274	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Monica are there.]
275	Chandler	 (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)
