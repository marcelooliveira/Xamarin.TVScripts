3	Phoebe	 (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
4	Joey	 I’m sorry, do I know you?
5	Phoebe	 What are you doing?
6	Joey	 Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!
7	Phoebe	 Oh! You got it?!
8	Joey	 Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.
9	Monica	 What was it for?
10	Joey	 Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.
11	Phoebe	 The next next?
12	Joey	 Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. (Joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!
13	Estelle	 Joey! It’s Estelle! I just talked to the casting people
14	Joey	 (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
15	Estelle	 Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
16	Joey	 (on phone) Oh my God!
17	Estelle	 There’s just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
18	Joey	 Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
19	Phoebe	 What’s the matter?
20	Joey	 They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
21	Monica	 Wow!
22	Joey	 I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!
23	Phoebe	 Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.
24		Opening Credits
25	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, (although its really just Monica’s now with Matthew Perry in rehab) Monica is folding her laundry with Ross reading the paper and Phoebe standing in the kitchen.]
26	Phoebe	 Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
27	Monica	 Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
28	Ross	 A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
29	Monica	 Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
30	Phoebe	 Sure.
31	Monica	 I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us for a few days.
32	Ross	 Cassie?
33	Monica	 Uh-hmm.
34	Ross	 Wow, I haven’t seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
35	Monica	 Ross, she’s 25 years old.
36	Ross	 So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
37	Rachel	 (entering) Hi!
38	Monica	 Hey!
39	Phoebe	 Hey!
40	Rachel	 Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
41	Phoebe	 Yeah!
42	Monica	 Subtle guys!
43	Phoebe	 What?!
44	Monica	 I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.
45	Rachel	 (laughs) Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!
46	Monica	 Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
47	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
48	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Joey is entering.]
49	Monica	 Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
50	Joey	 I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
51	Monica	 That’s what you say about porn.
52	Joey	 You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.
53	Monica	 No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
54	Joey	 Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.
55	Monica	 Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)
56	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are trying to plan Monica’s shower.]
57	Phoebe	 Well, when can we have this shower?
58	Rachel	 She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…
59	Phoebe	 Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?
60	Rachel	 Yesterday!
61	Phoebe	 Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!
62	Rachel	 Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
63	Phoebe	 Rachel, calm down!
64	Rachel	 (calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.
65	Phoebe	 (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
66	Rachel	 Phoebe, I already, I already did.
67	Phoebe	 Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
68	Rachel	 Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
69	Phoebe	 Uh, here. What time?
70	Rachel	 4 o’clock. Food?
71	Phoebe	 Finger sandwiches and tea.
72	Rachel	 Ooh great! Very Monica.
73	Phoebe	 And chili!
74	Rachel	 Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
75	Phoebe	 Both!
76	Rachel	 We’re paying for this y’know.
77	Phoebe	 Neither.
78	Rachel	 Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
79	Phoebe	 Lusts of the flesh.
80	Rachel	 (pause) What?
81	Phoebe	 I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
82	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch writing when Chandler enters to make his brief cameo.]
83	Chandler	 Hey!
84	Monica	 Hey!
85	Chandler	 Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
86	Monica	 Oh boy, me too!
87	Chandler	 Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
88	Monica	 Yeah?
89	Chandler	 Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
90	Monica	 The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
91	Chandler	 That’s me! Come on!
92	Monica	 Okay. (They both jump up to head for their room, but Monica stops.) But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.
93	Chandler	 Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
94	Monica	 Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
95		(Cassie enters from the guest room, with her hair up. The extremely beautiful and sexy Denise Richards is playing Cassie. Woo hoo! For those of you who don’t know who she is, rent Wild Things and she was also the last Bond girl in The World Is Not Enough.)
96	Cassie	 I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
97	Chandler	 (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
98	Cassie	 Nice to meet you too.
99	Monica	 So, are you ready to go?
100	Cassie	 Yeah.
101		(She lets her hair down and whips her hair around in Baywatch-esque slow motion with a Barry White song in the background. Chandler needless to say can’t help but stare along with the rest of the male and lesbian population of North America.)
102	Monica	 (catching him) Chandler!
103	Chandler	 I’ll be right with you.
104	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is there as Chandler and Monica enters.]
105	Monica	 (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
106	Ross	 What—why?
107	Monica	 Because Purvy Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.
108	Ross	 What?! Chandler, she’s our cousin!
109	Chandler	 I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.) Say something.
110	Monica	 You were staring about eight inches south of there.
111	Ross	 Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
112	Monica	 She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
113	Chandler	 Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
114	Monica	 Wafer thin ice!
115	[Scene	 A Casting Director’s Office, Joey is entering for his callback.]
116	Joey	 Hey, I’m back!
117	The Casting Director	 Hi-hi Joey.
118	Joey	 Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
119	The Casting Director	 Actually, I tried to call you. You didn’t need to come down here today.
120	Joey	 Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)
121	The Casting Director	 Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
122	Joey	 And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
123	The Casting Director	 Well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
124	Joey	 Wow! Sure! That’s great!
125	The Casting Director	 Oh, and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
126	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
127	The Casting Director	 Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah, and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t Jewish. So… (Laughs.)
128	Joey	 So…What?
129	The Casting Director	 So uh well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying?
130	Joey	 Yes!
131	The Casting Director	 Okay.
132	Joey	 No. What?
133	The Casting Director	 An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be…
134	Joey	 Barmitsvahed?
135		(The casting director shakes her head.)
136	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Joey is telling Monica what the casting director was trying to get to.]
137	Monica	 So to get this part you can’t be?
138	Joey	 Nope.
139	Monica	 But you are?
140	Joey	 Yep.
141	Monica	 But you told them you weren’t?
142	Joey	 That’s right.
143	Monica	 Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?
144	Joey	 I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
145	Monica	 Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!
146	Joey	 I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
147	Monica	 Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
148	Joey	 I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. (Gets up for the phone.)
149	Monica	 Unless!
150	Joey	 Unless what?
151	Monica	 Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
152	Joey	 Like what?
153	Monica	 Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
154	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering and Rachel is still planning.]
155	Phoebe	 Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.
156	Rachel	 Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
157	Phoebe	 Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?
158	Monica	 (entering) Hey!
159	Phoebe	 Hey!
160	Rachel	 Hey! What’s up Mon?
161	Monica	 Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
162	Rachel	 Have at it.
163	Monica	 Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work. Cheese? (Picks it up) That won’t work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that won’t work.
164	Rachel	 Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
165	Monica	 No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.
166	Phoebe and Rachel	 Okay.
167	Monica	 I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (Runs out.)
168	Rachel	 (To Phoebe, after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!
169	Phoebe	 Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it up.) We have a guest list!
170	Rachel	 Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
171	Phoebe	 Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
172	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, there is a knock on the door and Ross opens it to Cassie.]
173	Ross	 (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
174	Cassie	 Hey Ross!
175	Ross	 Hey!
176	Cassie	 (hugs him) It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
177	Ross	 Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn’t.
178	Cassie	 Ah yeah, sorry about that.
179	Ross	 It’s okay. Come, come on in.
180	Cassie	 Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fianc�e sure stares a lot.
181	Ross	 Oh.
182		(She sets down her bag and we travel back to slow motion world. She once again whips her hair around in slow motion with the love doctor Barry White singing in the background. And I’d also like to take this opportunity to mention that she can also be seen in Starship Troopers and that she was born in Downers Grove, Illinois which just happens to be a few miles from where I live. Anyway, Cousin Ross is now staring.)
183	Cassie	 Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
184	Ross	 Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.
185	Cassie	 Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
186	Ross	 Yeah—No!!
187		Commercial Break
188	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Cassie is eating dinner and Ross is pacing behind her because of what she’s eating.]
189	Ross	 Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
190	Cassie	 I’m all done.
191	Ross	 (quietly) Thank God.
192	Cassie	 I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
193	Ross	 Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now.
194	Cassie	 I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)
195	Ross	 (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
196	Cassie	 It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
197	Ross	 Well I’m, I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children would be.
198	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment, it’s Monica’s bridal shower and Phoebe is passing out some finger food.]
199	Phoebe	 Hi!
200	Woman	 Hi!
201	Phoebe	 How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.) Hi, thanks for coming.
202	Woman	 Oh thank you.
203		(The other woman declines.)
204	Phoebe	 Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.) Oh, it’s so nice to see you.
205	Woman	 No.
206	The Other Woman	 No thanks.
207	Phoebe	 Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
208	Rachel	 Yeah?
209	Phoebe	 Who the hell are all these people?
210	Rachel	 Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
211	Phoebe	 Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that
212		(A woman approaches.)
213	Rachel	 (to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
214	Woman	 I was her accountant four years ago.
215	Rachel	 Ohhhh!
216	Woman	 I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes these last four years.
217	Rachel	 That’s great!
218	Woman	 So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
219	Phoebe and Rachel	 (to each other) I don’t know.
220	Rachel	 (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You didn’t tell her to come?!
221	Phoebe	 You were supposed to tell her!
222	Rachel	 No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was supposed to bring the cake!
223	Phoebe	 Fine, I’ll go call her.
224	Rachel	 Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
225	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the counter as Monica enters carrying a tray.]
226	Monica	 Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
227	Joey	 Wow! This looks great!
228	Monica	 Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is made of bologna. (Points.)
229	Joey	 And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
230	Monica	 Oh, just until the glue dries.
231	Joey	 Thank God!
232	Monica	 (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
233	Joey	 Ah.
234	Monica	 Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.
235	Joey	 Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
236	Monica	 I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.
237	Joey	 Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
238		(He goes into his room to try them on and closes the door.)
239	Joey	 Ow!
240	Monica	 Toothpick?
241	Joey	 Yeah.
242	Monica	 What are you trying on now?
243	Joey	 The fruit roll up.
244	Monica	 And?
245	Joey	 Delicious.
246	Monica	 Joey!
247	Joey	 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
248	Monica	 What?! Which one?!
249	Joey	 The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
250		(They hug.)
251	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Cassie and Ross are watching a movie and Cassie is pouring Ross some more wine, as Ross has his hands full with the glass and holding the bowl of popcorn in his lap.]
252	Ross	 (in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.
253		(They exchange looks, smile, and shrug their shoulders before Ross suddenly lunges forward in an attempt to kiss her, but she expertly backs away.)
254	Cassie	 Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
255	Ross	 (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head) Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.
256	[Scene	 outside Phoebe's apartment, Monica is knocking on the door.]
257	Monica	 Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.) Oh.
258	Rachel	 Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
259	Monica	 For what?
260	Rachel	 Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
261	Phoebe	 And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
262	Monica	 You al-you already had it?
263	Phoebe	 Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
264	Rachel	 Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.
265	Phoebe	 We ruined everything.
266	Rachel	 Ugh…
267	Monica	 Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
268	Rachel	 What do you, what do you mean?
269	Monica	 Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk to people I don’t even like!
270		(Suddenly, everyone stands up and comes out of hiding. All of them are glaring at Monica.)
271	Rachel	 Surprise…
272	Phoebe	 Sur-surprise.
273	Rachel	 …Monica.
274	[Scene	 The casting director’s office, Joey is there to show off to the director, so to speak.]
275	Joey	 And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
276	The Director	 Yeah.
277	Joey	 My whole family’s from Naples!
278	The Director	 Oh that’s great! Okay, well I’ve heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie…
279	The Casting Director	 Joey, this is the awkward part.
280	Joey	 Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands, back up and looks down.) So there you go, that’s me. (We cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through Joey’s legs.) One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.
281		Ending Credits
282	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is getting out linens for Cassie who is in the bathroom.]
283	Phoebe	 Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
284	Cassie	 Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
285	Phoebe	 Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
286	Cassie	 (noticing her) What?
287	Phoebe	 (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!
