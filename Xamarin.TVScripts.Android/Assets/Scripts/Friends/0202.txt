2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are showing off Ben to the gang.]
3	Monica	 (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)
4	Phoebe	 Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
5	Susan	 Oh, is he hungry already?
6	Carol	 I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)
7	Chandler	 You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
8	Joey	 (joins him) I gotta get one, too.
9	Ross	 (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
10	Chandler	 We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
11	Ross	 Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
12	Joey	 Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
13	Ross	 This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
14		(They go back into the living room)
15	Ross	 Carol?
16	Chandler	 Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
17	Carol	 Sure.
18	Joey	 Uh, does it hurt?
19	Carol	 It did at first, but not anymore.
20	Joey	 Chandler?
21	Chandler	 So, uh, how often can you do it?
22	Carol	 As much as he needs.
23	Joey	 Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?

25	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang is all there.]
26	Julie	 Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
27	Rachel	 Yeah, I forget which ones.
28	Julie	 Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
29	All	 No thanks.
30	Julie	 (To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. (Ties it back up for her)
31	Rachel	 (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.
32	Julie	 Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
33	Phoebe	 I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
34	Monica	 Ok, um, I'll go with you.
35	Julie	 Great.
36	Ross	 (enters) Hi, honey.
37	Chandler	 Hey, sweetums.
38	Ross	 Hello to the rest.
39	All	 Hi!
40	Joey	 Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
41	Monica	 It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
42	Chandler	 Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
43	Monica	 But I'm...
44	Phoebe	 Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
45	Ross	 (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
46	Monica	 Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
47	Ross	 It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
48	Monica	 You're welcome.
49	Phoebe	 Woof, woof.

55		(The Hombre man enters.)
56	Hombre Man	 (to a customer) Hombre? (The guy says yes, and gets his sample.)
57	Joey	 What's he doin' in my section?
58	Annabelle	 I guess he doesn't know.
59	Joey	 Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man) Hey, how ya doin'?
60	Hombre Man	 Mornin'.
61	Joey	 Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
62	Hombre Man	 Your territory, huh?
63	Joey	 Yeah. Bijan for men?
64	Guy	 No thanks.
65	Hombre Man	 Hombre?
66	Guy	 Yeah. All right. (They guy gets his sample and leaves.)
67	Hombre Man	 (To Joey) You were saying?
68	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Monica enters.]
69	Monica	 Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
70	Phoebe	 What?
71	Monica	 We were shopping, and we had lunch.
72	Phoebe	 Oh, all right. What did I have?
73	Monica	 You had a salad.
74	Phoebe	 Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
75	Rachel	 (entering) Hey, guys, what's up.
76	Phoebe	 I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
77	Rachel	 Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
78	Phoebe	 Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
79	Rachel	 You went shopping for fur?
80	Phoebe	 Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.
81	Rachel	 You bought boobs?
82	Phoebe	 (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
83	[Scene	 The Department Store, Joey is trying to sell some cologne.]
84	Joey	 (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
85	Annabelle	 Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
86	Hombre Man	 (entering) Ready, Annabelle?
87	Annabelle	 You bet. (to Joey) Maybe some other time?
88	Joey	 (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?!
89	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Carol is dropping Ben off for Ross to watch.]
90	Carol	 Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
91	Ross	 Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
92	Susan	 Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
93	Rachel	 Oh, this is so cute.
94	Susan	 Oh, I got that for him.
95	Ross	 My mommies love me. That's clever.
96	Monica	 Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—(Sees Rachel is watching)—Hi, Jew! (Walks into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)
97	Rachel	 Did you just say Hi, Jew?
98	Monica	 Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
99	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are eating, and Phoebe is preparing Ben's milk.]
100	Phoebe	 Ben, dinner!
101	Ross	 Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
102	Phoebe	 Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)
103	Chandler	 What did you just do?
104	Phoebe	 I licked my arm, what?
105	Ross	 It's breast milk.
106	Phoebe	 So?
107	Rachel	 Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
108	Joey	 What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)
109	Chandler	 What did you just do?
110	Ross	 Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
111	Phoebe	 You won't even taste it?
112	Ross	 No!
113	Phoebe	 Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
114	Ross	 Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
115	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, time lapse. Rachel is entering the living room from her bedroom as Monica enters.]
116	Monica	 Hey, where is everybody?
117	Rachel	 They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
118	Monica	 Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
119	Rachel	 Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and notices she also grabbed a receipt.)
120	Monica	 Okay.
121	Rachel	 Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
122	Monica	 You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
123	Rachel	 And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
124	Monica	 That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
125	Rachel	 Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
126	Monica	 Judy.
127	Rachel	 Who?
128	Monica	 Julie.
129	Rachel	 What?!
130	Monica	 Jody!
131	Rachel	 You were with Julie?
132	Monica	 Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
133	Rachel	 Oh. Oh my God.
134	Monica	 Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
135	Rachel	 Yeah, right. Sure!
136	Monica	 Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
137	Rachel	 Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)
138	Monica	 That is not true!
139	Rachel	 Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
140	Monica	 Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
141	Rachel	 Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? (Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. (Exits.)
142		Commercial Break
143	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ben is playing in his crib while Chandler and Ross are leaning against the rim and are completely asleep.]
144	Monica	 (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.
145		(There's a knock on the door which is answered by Phoebe.)
146	Carol and Susan	 Hey! (This wakes Chandler and Ross up)
147	Carol	 How did we do?
148	Phoebe	 Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
149	Ross	 I did not freak out.
150	Carol	 Why'd you freak out?
151	Ross	 Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
152	Carol	 My breast milk is gross?
153	Susan	 This should be fun.
154	Ross	 No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
155	Chandler	 Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
156	Carol	 Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. (Holding out a bottle.)
157	Ross	 (jumping away) That would be no.
158	Phoebe	 Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
159	Joey	 Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
160	Susan	 Cantaloupe juice.
161	Joey	 Exactly.
162	Ross	 (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
163	Susan	 Uh huh.
164	Ross	 Oh, you've tasted it.
165	Susan	 You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
166	Ross	 (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.)
167	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is wiping down the peninsula counter as Joey enters dressed like a cowboy.]
168	Chandler	 Howdy.
169	Joey	 (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
170	Chandler	 Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
171	Joey	 Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
172	Chandler	 (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
173	Joey	 I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
174	Chandler	 (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
175	Joey	 Yeah I guess you're right.
176	Chandler	 You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
177	Joey	 I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)
178	Chandler	 All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
179	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, Rachel is cleaning up and Monica is pleading with her.]
180	Monica	 I don't know what else to say.
181	Rachel	 Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
182	Monica	 I feel terrible, I really do.
183	Rachel	 Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
184	Monica	 Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
185	Rachel	 Yes.
186	Monica	 It's that terrible?
187	Rachel	 Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually (starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.
188	Monica	 Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, (starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
189	Rachel	 I love you too. (They hug.)
190	Phoebe	 You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and sits down.)
191	Monica	 Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
192	Rachel	 (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that.
193	Monica	 (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
194	Phoebe	 Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)
195	[Scene	 The Department Store, Joey and the Hombre man are facing off in Joey's section.]
196	Joey	 Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.
197	Hombre Man	 I heard ya.
198	Store Guy	 All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
199	Hombre Man	 Ready.
200	Joey	 Yeah, I'm ready.
201		(An old West style showdown starts with Joey and the Hombre Man staring each other down as the store guy slowly lets in the first customer while Joey and the Hombre Man get ready to draw. In slow motion they spot the customer, eye each other, draw, and as the customer walks into the middle Joey's bottle misfires but the Hombre Man spays it into the customer's eyes.)
202	Customer	 You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
203	Store Guy	 Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
204	Hombre Man	 I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
205	Annabelle	 (seeing the end result) My god, what happened?
206	Joey	 These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
207	Annabelle	 Sure.
208		(They walk off into the sunset, at least a picture of one.)
209	[Scene	 Central Perk, Julie and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
210	Julie	 So.
211	Rachel	 So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
212	Julie	 I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
213	Rachel	 Really? Me?
214	Julie	 Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
215	Rachel	 Well, you're not totally paranoid.
216	Julie	 Oy.
217	Rachel	 Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
218	Julie	 Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
219	Rachel	 Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
220	Julie	 I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
221	Rachel	 All right, Julie.
222	Julie	 Bye. (Gets up.)
223	Rachel	 Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.
224		Closing Credits
225	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, another showdown is occuring, only this time its between Ross, a plate of cookies, and the breast milk. They've been eyeing each other for a while now, and Chandler and Joey are getting bored. He checks his Ross and in frustration, shoves his watch in front of Ross's eyes as if saying, "Hurry it up already!" Finally, Ross scratches his head, does that again, itches his nose, scratches his head, grabs the bottle, takes a big swig, and piles several cookies into his mouth.]
226	Ross	 (with a mouthful) That's not bad.
