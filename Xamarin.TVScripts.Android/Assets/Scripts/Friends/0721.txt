3	Monica	 Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
4	Chandler	 Do you realize you get louder each week?
5	Monica	 There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
6	Chandler	 I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow. (Laughs)
7	Monica	 Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
8	Chandler	 Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
9	Monica	 No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.
10	Chandler	 Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
11	Monica	 (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)
12	Chandler	 (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.
13		Opening Credits
14	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is getting help writing his vows from Joey and Ross.]
15	Chandler	 (writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
16	Joey	 All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
17	Ross	 Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
18	Chandler	 I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
19	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica has hit a writer’s block as Rachel and Phoebe enter.]
20	Rachel	 Monica what?
21	Phoebe	 What?!
22	Rachel	 What is the emergency?!
23	Monica	 You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.)
24	Rachel	 Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
25	Monica	 Thank you.
26	Phoebe	 Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
27	Monica	 Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
28	Phoebe	 Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
29		[Cut to the guys.]
30	Ross	 Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
31	Chandler	 Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.
32		[Flashback to when Chandler was introduced to Monica in The One With The Thanksgiving Flashbacks.]
33	Ross	 ...everyone, this is Chandler!
34	Fat Monica	 Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
35	Chandler	 (seeing her) Okay.
36		[Cut to the girls.]
37	Rachel	 Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
38		[Flashback to The One With The Jellyfish, Chandler and Monica are lying on the beach.]
39	Chandler	 All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
40	Monica	 Ennnh.
41		[Cut back to the girls.]
42	Monica	 Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
43	Phoebe	 Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you. Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.
44		[Flashback to The One With Phoebe's Uterus, Monica is teaching Chandler how to turn a woman on. They're in Monica and Rachel's apartment and Monica has just drawn a diagram of a woman.]
45	Monica	 Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than three), five, six, and seven!
46	Chandler	 (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?
47	Monica	 It’s kind of an important one!
48	Chandler	 Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
49	Rachel	 Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)
50	Monica	 All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
51		[Cut to the guys.]
52	Joey	 Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica…
53	Chandler	 (writing) Monica…
54	Joey	 "…when I look back over our time together…"
55	Chandler	 (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
56	Joey	 Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.
57		[This starts a series of flashbacks beginning with Monica and Chandler in the waiting room in The One With the Birth.]
58	Phoebe	 Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
59	Monica	 No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
60	Chandler	 You'll get one.
61	Monica	 Oh yeah? When?
62	Chandler	 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
63	Monica	 Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
64	Chandler	 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
65	Monica	 Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
66	Chandler	 No, no, no.
67	Monica	 What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?
68	Chandler	 (trapped) Uh, uh.
69	Monica	 Well?
70	Chandler	 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
71		[Cut to Ross leaping into Chandler’s Hotel room in London in The One With Ross’s Wedding.]
72	Ross	 (Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.)
73	Monica	 (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)
74		[Cut to Chandler opening the door to his and Joey’s apartment to reveal Monica standing there with a turkey on her head in The One With The Thanksgiving Flashbacks.]
75	Chandler	 Nice try.
76	Monica	 Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
77	Chandler	 Look, Monica…
78	Monica	 Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
79	Chandler	 This is not going to work.
80	Monica	 I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
81	Chandler	 You are so great! I love you!
82		(Monica stops suddenly and turns around slowly.)
83	Monica	 What?
84	Chandler	 Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
85	Monica	 You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
86	Chandler	 No I didn't!
87	Monica	 Yes, you did!
88	Chandler	 No I didn't!
89	Monica	 You love me!
90	Chandler	 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
91		(Joey walks in and sees Monica. He freaks out and runs back into the hallway, screaming.)
92		[Cut to Chandler trying to hint to Monica that he wanted to move in with her in The One After Vegas.]
93	Chandler	 Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
94	Monica	 Then all your stuff would be here.
95	Chandler	 Well, what if all my stuff was here?
96	Monica	 Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
97	Chandler	 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
98		[Cut to Chandler entering his and Monica’s apartment in The One With The Proposal.]
99		(He walks dejectedly into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles and Monica standing in the living room.)
100	Monica	 You wanted it to be a surprise.
101		(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)
102	Chandler	 Oh my God.
103		(Monica gets down on one knee.)
104	Monica	 Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
105	Chandler	 Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
106	Monica	 Yes.
107		(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as an engaged couple.)
108	Joey	 (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
109	Monica	 Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!
110		(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)
111		Commercial Break
112	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch as Joey and Ross enter.]
113	Joey	 Hey!
114	Ross	 Hey!
115	Rachel	 Hey!
116	Phoebe	 Hey!
117	Rachel	 Hey, what have you guys been up to?
118	Ross	 Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
119	Joey	 How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
120	Ross	 How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
121	Phoebe	 Well let’s just say its.. she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
122	Ross	 I can’t believe that in four weeks they’re gonnta be married!
123	Phoebe	 Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
124	Ross	 Phoebe that’s not true.
125	Phoebe	 Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?
126	Rachel	 I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
127	Joey	 (shocked) Has it been that long?!
128	Ross	 Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
129		[Flashback to Joey interrupting a bath Monica and Chandler are sharing in The One With All The Kissing. Monica dives underwater as Joey opens the door.]
130		(They move into a kiss but are interrupted by Joey knocking on the door.)
131	Joey	 Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
132		(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what Chandler's doing.)
133	Chandler	 I've had a very long, hard day.
134	Joey	 Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
135	Chandler	 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
136	Joey	 Okay.
137		(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)
138	Chandler	 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
139	Monica	 Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
140	Chandler	 Hey Joe!
141		(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)
142	Chandler	 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.
143		(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)
144		[Cut back to Central Perk.]
145	Rachel	 I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
146	Joey	 I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
147		[This starts a series of flashbacks starting with Monica and Chandler forcing Joey to keep his new-found knowledge of their secret relationship in Monica’s bedroom in The One With All the Kips.]
148	Joey	 (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
149	Monica	 Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
150	Joey	 How?! When?!
151	Chandler	 It happened in London.
152	Joey	 IN LONDON!!!
153	Chandler	 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
154	Joey	 But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
155		(They both grab him and stop him.)
156	Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
157	Monica	 Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
158		(Joey thinks it over.)
159	Joey	 All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
160		[Cut to Rachel listening to a phone conversation between Chandler and Monica in The One With All the Resolutions.]
161	Monica	 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
162	Chandler	 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
163	Monica	 (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…
164	Rachel	 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
165		[Cut to Phoebe in Ross’s new apartment looking at Monica and Chandler and what they’re about to do in The One Where Everybody Finds Out.]
166	Phoebe	 (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
167	Rachel	 What?!
168	Phoebe	 (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
169	Rachel	 Oh my God!
170	Phoebe	 CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
171	Rachel	 OH MY GOD!!!
172	Phoebe	 OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
173	Rachel	 Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
174	Phoebe	 NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
175	Rachel	 I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
176	Phoebe	 YOU KNOW?!!!
177	Rachel	 Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming!!
178	Ross	 (entering) What's going on?
179	Phoebe and Rachel	 Ohhh!!!
180	Rachel	 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!
181	Ross	 What?! What?!
182	Rachel	 Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
183	Ross	 Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
184	Phoebe	 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
185		(Ross starts jumping and screaming incoherently and hops over and joins in on the group hug.)
186		[Cut to later in that episode in Central Perk, a meeting with Phoebe, Rachel, and Joey where they discuss Chandler and Monica.]
187	Phoebe	 Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows?
188	Joey	 Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
189	Phoebe	 Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
190		[Cut to later in that episode. Rachel and Phoebe are going to a movie from Monica and Chandler’s, and as Phoebe walks by Chandler she pinches him on the butt and exits.]
191	Rachel	 All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
192	Monica	 Bye!
193	All	 Bye!
194	Phoebe	 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
195	Chandler	 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
196	Monica	 Actually, I did!
197	Chandler	 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
198	Monica	 Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
199		[Cut to later in that episode. Monica and Chandler are confronting Joey in his apartment about Phoebe’s knowledge.]
200	Chandler	 Phoebe knows about us!
201	Joey	 Well I didn't tell them!
202	Monica	 Them?! Who's them?
203	Joey	 Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
204	Monica	 Joey!
205	Joey	 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
206	Monica	 Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So…
207	Chandler	 Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!
208		[Cut to later in that episode. Phoebe is telling Rachel in Monica and Chandler’s that Chandler wants to make a date with Phoebe.]
209	Phoebe	 I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
210	Rachel	 Are you kidding?!
211	Phoebe	 No!
212	Rachel	 I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?
213	Joey	 No.
214	Rachel	 Joey!
215	Joey	 They know you know.
216	Rachel	 Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
217	Phoebe	 God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!
218	Joey	 I couldn't even if I wanted to.
219		[Cut to later in that episode. Chandler is in his bathroom with Monica, and he’s panicking on how far Phoebe is pushing him.]
220	Chandler	 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
221	Monica	 She's bluffing!
222	Chandler	 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
223		[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]
224	Phoebe	 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
225	Joey	 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
226	Rachel	 Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
227	Joey	 Ooh!
228	Rachel	 Okay!
229	Joey	 I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
230	Phoebe	 Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.
231	Joey	 It's not my first time.
232		[Cut to the bathroom.]
233	Monica	 You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!
234	Chandler	 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
235	Monica	 Of course.
236		[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.]
237	Chandler	 Oh, you're-you're going?
238	Phoebe	 Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
239	Chandler	 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
240	Phoebe	 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
241	Chandler	 Not if I kiss you first.
242		(They move closer together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He puts his hand on her waist, but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.)
243	Phoebe	 Ooh.
244	Chandler	 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
245	Phoebe	 Here it comes. Our first kiss.
246		(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.)
247	Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
248	Phoebe	 And why not?!
249	Chandler	 Because I'm in love with Monica!!
250	Phoebe	 You're-you're what?!
251		(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)
252	Chandler	 Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
253	Monica	 I love you too, Chandler. (They kiss.)
254	Phoebe	 I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
255	Joey	 So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
256	Monica	 Well actually, Ross doesn't.
257	Chandler	 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
258		[Cut to later in that episode. Ross is showing his boss his new place.]
259	Ross	 (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
260	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Joey and Ross are talking.]
261	Phoebe	 Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.
262	Rachel	 You really think it would be that different?
263	Phoebe	 How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
264	Rachel	 Well, things change.
265	Joey	 I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
266	Ross	 It’ll be okay Joe.
267	Joey	 I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.
268		[Flashback to the gang in Central Perk in The One Where Nana Dies Twice, they’re all going through an old photo album.]
269	Rachel	 Hey, who's this little naked guy?
270	Ross	 That little naked guy would be me.
271	Rachel	 Aww, look at the little thing.
272	Ross	 Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
273	Chandler	 Who are those people?
274	Ross	 Got me.
275	Monica	 Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
276	Rachel	 Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
277	Monica	 Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
278	Ross	 Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
279	Joey	 Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
280	Ross	 (looking) No-no, that would be me again.
281		[Cut back to Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
282	Monica	 Hey, you guys!
283	Phoebe	 Hey.
284	Joey	 Hey.
285	Chandler	 What’s going on?
286	Rachel	 Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
287	Joey	 Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.
288	Monica	 Oh that’s so sweet.
289	Chandler	 So we both finished our vows.
290	Phoebe	 Oh!
291	Joey	 Hey!
292	Rachel	 Oh, can we read them?
293	Monica	 Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.
294	Rachel	 Okay.
295	Phoebe	 Okay.
296		(They spilt into their sexes and the girls read Monica’s and the guys read Chandler’s. The girls gasp and groan and the guys laugh hysterically.
297	Phoebe	 (To Monica) Oh, that’s beautiful.
298	Joey	 (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That’s good!
299	Rachel	 (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
300		(Ross laughs.)
301	Joey	 What? I don’t get it.
302		(Ross points to the explanation and he gets it.)
303	Ross	 (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.
304	Monica	 Chandler!!
305	Chandler	 Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.
306		Ending Credits
307	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Joey are reading Chandler’s new vows.]
308	Chandler	 Okay, what do you guys think?
309	Ross	 (quietly) Dude!
310	Joey	 (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
311	Chandler	 You really like it?
312	Ross	 Dude! How-how did you write this?
313	Chandler	 I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
314	Ross	 You can’t do that!
315	Joey	 If he goes first he can!
