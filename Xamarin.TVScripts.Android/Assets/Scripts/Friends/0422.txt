2	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang is there, Phoebe is returning from the bathroom.]
3	Phoebe	 (angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!
4	Monica	 That’s also like the tenth time you told us.
5	Phoebe	 Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!
6	Ross	 Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?
7	Phoebe	 (starting to cry) Thank you so much.
8	Rachel	 So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
9	Phoebe	 I haven’t really had any yet.
10		(Monica, Joey, and Chandler all shake their heads.)
11		Opening Credits
12	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are there as Ross enters.]
13	Ross	 Hey guys!
14	Chandler	 Hey.
15	Joey	 Hey!
16	Ross	 All right, here’s the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily)
17	Chandler	 (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
18	Ross	 So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
19	Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
20	Chandler	 Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.
21	Ross	 I sort’ve already asked Chandler.
22	Joey	 What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
23	Ross	 Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer.
24	Joey	 Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!
25	Chandler	 You can be the best man when I get married.
26	Joey	 (pause) I’ll never get to be a best man!
27	Ross	 (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
28	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
29	Joey	 (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you just said I could!
30	Chandler	 I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
31	Joey	 I can’t believe you’re not picking me.
32	Ross	 Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
33	Chandler	 I’m not even… I’m not even…
34	Ross	 Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
35	Joey	 Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.
36	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are eating breakfast.]
37	Phoebe	 (to her babies) Stop it!
38	Monica	 What?
39	Phoebe	 One of the babies is kicking.
40	Monica	 I thought that was a good thing.
41	Phoebe	 It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!
42	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
43	Monica	 Hey!
44	Joey	 Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
45	Monica	 Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet.
46	Joey	 (grabs it) Thanks.
47	Monica	 Why do you need it?
48	Joey	 Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the door.)
49	Rachel	 Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
50	Joey	 Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)
51	Phoebe	 Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)
52	Rachel	 Hormones!
53	Monica	 What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party and we’re not invited?
54	Joey	 Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party.
55	Monica	 Sooo?
56	Joey	 Are you bachelors?
57	Monica	 Nooo!
58	Joey	 Are you strippers?
59	Rachel	 Nooo!
60	Joey	 Then you’re not invited. (Starts for the door again.)
61	Rachel	 All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna have either.
62	Joey	 Oh-whoa, what party?
63	Rachel	 Well umm…
64	Monica	 The baby shower for Phoebe!
65	Joey	 Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don’t want to do! Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)
66	Phoebe	 I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.
67	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Ross are talking over party plans.]
68	Joey	 This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
69	Ross	 Great. Great.
70	Joey	 Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.
71	Gunther	 I’ll be there.
72	Joey	 All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
73	Ross	 Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
74	Joey	 Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.
75	Chandler	 (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?
76	Ross	 Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
77	Chandler	 Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
78	Ross	 Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
79	Chandler	 Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.
80	Ross	 Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
81	Joey	 You got it.
82	Ross	 Okay, see ya later.
83	Chandler	 See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
84	Joey	 Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything about no strippers.
85	Chandler	 He just said, "No strippers."
86	Joey	 Oh, I chose not to hear that.
87	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is returning from shopping and Rachel is there.]
88	Monica	 Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?
89	Rachel	 Little village people.
90	Monica	 Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It’s a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)
91	Rachel	 Oh, that is so sweet!
92	Monica	 I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
93	Rachel	 Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
94	Monica	 Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.
95	Rachel	 Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
96	Monica	 Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
97	Rachel	 Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!
98	Monica	 Oh, she’s gonna love that!
99	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe’s baby shower, she is holding those leather pants, and isn’t happy about it.]
100	Phoebe	 What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what’s my next present?!
101	All	 I don’t have anything. (All of the rest of the women there hide their gifts behind their backs.)
102	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross’s bachelor party. Ross is thanking Joey for the party.]
103	Ross	 Hey listen man, about the stripper…
104	Joey	 Yeah?
105	Ross	 Good call!
106	Chandler	 (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
107	Gunther	 What’s my last name?
108	Chandler	 Central Perk?
109	Gunther	 (to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
110	Joey	 Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)
111	Ross	 Hey-hey, what are those?
112	Joey	 Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads, "Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998")
113	Ross	 Wow! Yeah!
114	Joey	 Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, "Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)
115	Chandler	 (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
116	The Stripper	 Great!
117	Ross	 Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
118	Joey	 Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.
119	Ross	 Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
120	Joey	 Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
121	The Stripper	 Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
122	Joey	 Yeah!
123	The Stripper	 Wow, I didn’t know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
124	Joey	 Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.)
125	The Stripper	 You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
126	Joey	 Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…
127	The Stripper	 Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
128	Joey	 Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
129	The Stripper	 Yeah?
130	Joey	 Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.
131	[Scene	 Joey’s bedroom, it’s the middle of the night, he’s waking up and discovers he’s alone in bed.]
132	Joey	 Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)
133		Commercial Break
134	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, it’s continued from earlier. Joey is now waking Chandler and telling him the news.]
135	Joey	 (running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
136	Chandler	 (opening the door) What?
137	Joey	 The ring is gone!
138	Chandler	 Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!
139	Joey	 Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!
140	Chandler	 You slept with the stripper?
141	Joey	 Of course!! (Shrugs.)
142	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.]
143	Phoebe	 Hi, guys.
144	Rachel	 Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)
145	Monica	 Hi Phoebe.
146	Phoebe	 I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.
147	Rachel	 No we…
148	Monica	 Hormones.
149	Rachel	 …hormones, yeah.
150	Phoebe	 Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
151	Monica	 Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?
152	Phoebe	 Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?
153	Rachel	 Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.
154	Phoebe	 Oh!
155	Rachel	 It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
156	Phoebe	 Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
157	Rachel	 Well, h-how is this like that?
158	Phoebe	 Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
159	Rachel	 (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…
160	Phoebe	 Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
161	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.]
162	Joey	 Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?
163	Ross	 (entering) Hey guys!
164	Chandler	 Hey!
165	Joey	 Hey…
166	Ross	 I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
167	Joey	 So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!
168	Ross	 Yeah, right!
169	Joey	 I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…
170	Ross	 That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
171	Chandler	 So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
172	Ross	 Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
173	Chandler	 So you might say, it’s a magic ring.
174	Joey	 (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.
175	Ross	 My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
176	Chandler	 Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man."
177	Ross	 (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!
178	Joey	 Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!
179	Ross	 Not on you! On the stripper!
180	Joey	 Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
181	Ross	 Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!
182	Joey	 I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!"
183	Ross	 So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
184	Joey	 Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…
185	Chandler	 Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
186	Joey	 Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!
187	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.]
188	Monica	 Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)
189	Phoebe	 (sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.
190	Rachel	 Good.
191	Monica	 I’m so glad you liked it.
192	Phoebe	 (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
193	Monica	 What?!
194	Rachel	 What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
195	Phoebe	 Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
196	Rachel	 You what?
197	Monica	 Oh my God!
198	Phoebe	 Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
199	Monica	 Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!
200	Rachel	 Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
201	Phoebe	 No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
202	Monica	 Rachel, get the book! The book!
203	Rachel	 Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
204	Monica	 The Bible?!
205	Rachel	 I don’t know!
206	[Scene	 Chandler’s office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.]
207	Joey	 All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.
208	Ross	 Diverse.
209		(There’s a knock on the door.)
210	The Stripper	 Did anybody call for security?
211	Chandler	 (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
212	The Stripper	 Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.) Hey, Joey?
213	Ross	 Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
214	Chandler	 Way to be cool, man.
215	The Stripper	 What’s he talking about?
216	Joey	 There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
217	The Stripper	 Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
218	The Guys	 Yeah!
219	Ross	 We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
220	The Stripper	 Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
221	Chandler	 Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
222	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do, since their plan with the stripper backfired on them.]
223	Joey	 I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
224	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.]
225	Rachel	 I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.
226	Phoebe	 Well, do you see any babies?
227	Monica	 How do you feel?
228	Phoebe	 Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.
229	Rachel	 Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
230	Phoebe	 I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
231	Monica	 Some moms do that.
232	Phoebe	 Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
233	Monica	 Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.
234	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay.
235	Rachel	 No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?
236	Monica	 I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
237	Rachel	 And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
238	Phoebe	 Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
239	Monica	 Yeah.
240	Rachel	 And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
241	Phoebe	 They are gonna love me.
242	Rachel	 Oh!
243	Phoebe	 Thanks you guys! Again.
244	Monica	 Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
245	Phoebe	 You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!
246	Monica and Rachel	 What?!
247	Phoebe	 Just kidding. Ahh!
248	Rachel	 What?!
249	Monica	 Oh my God!
250	Phoebe	 Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
251	[Scene	 The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey is pacing around like an expectant father.]
252	Joey	 If anything should happen to him…
253	Ross	 Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
254	Joey	 So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!
255	Chandler	 He will, Joe.
256	Joey	 Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.
257		(With that we go into a little flashback about the guys’ memories of the duck. The first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then it’s Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it’s Chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls’ apartment, Joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them, and it’s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it’s wings. And the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)
258	Joey	 I’m so worried about him, y’know?
259	The Doctor	 (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?
260	Ross	 Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)
261	Joey	 H-h-h-how’s the duck?
262	The Doctor	 He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
263	Joey	 Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
264	Ross	 No, that’s all right.
265	Joey	 No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
266	Chandler	 Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.
267	Joey	 Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.
268	Chandler	 No, you should.
269	Joey	 Now, don’t argue with me…
270	Ross	 Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
271	Chandler	 Really?
272	Joey	 Really?
273	Ross	 Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional.)
274	Chandler	 Thanks man.
275	Joey	 (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they can’t see him cry.)
276	Chandler	 What a baby.
277	Ross	 Total wuss!
278		(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)
