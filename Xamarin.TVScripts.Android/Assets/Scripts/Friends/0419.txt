3	The Singing Man	 (singing, duh) Morning’s here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here! The morning’s here!
4	Rachel	 HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
5	The Singing Man	 Oh come on! Morning’s here! (Starts singing) Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
6		(Rachel slams shut her window and storms into the living room, where Joey and Monica are eating breakfast.)
7	Rachel	 I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
8	Joey	 Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning’s here! Morning is here—
9	Rachel	 Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
10	Monica	 Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
11	Rachel	 Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
12	Monica	 Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
13	Rachel	 I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
14	Monica	 Okay.
15	Joey	 See, this is a great apartment.
16	Monica	 Shut up! This place is a hole!
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 Ross’s bedroom; Ross and Emily are making out. Ross as a new feature.]
19	Emily	 Oh, blimey, I still can’t believe you’ve got an earring!
20		(Yep, it’s a little gold loop.)
21	Ross	 Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around, pretending like he’s jamming.)
22	Emily	 He does that?!
23	Ross	 Uh, I don’t know, whatever.
24	Emily	 I think it makes you look really dangerous.
25	Ross	 Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
26	Emily	 I love both of you!
27	Ross	 Yeah?
28		(They kiss.)
29	Emily	 I wish I didn’t have to go.
30	Ross	 Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.
31	Emily	 Ohh, Ross, please!
32	Ross	 One more day, seriously/
33	Emily	 Don’t do this to me, again. You’d know I’d stay here in a minute, but I’d really miss so much work, they’ll fire me.
34	Ross	 So, then you can stay as long as you want.
35	Emily	 I wish I could.
36	Ross	 Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)
37	Emily	 I don’t think you understand packing. Look, I just don’t want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
38	Ross	 Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
39	Emily	 You didn’t!
40	Ross	 No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
41	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are watching one of those Kung Fu movies and imitating the moves.]
42	Phoebe	 (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!
43	Chandler	 Ho! Ho! Ho!
44	Phoebe	 Excuse me.
45	Chandler	 Your pants!
46	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
47	Joey	 Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
48	Phoebe	 What?
49	Chandler	 Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn’t get it.) Santa Claus’s pants.
50	Phoebe	 Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.
51	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
52	Monica	 (entering) Hey!
53	Rachel	 So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
54	Phoebe	 I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.
55	Monica	 Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
56	Chandler	 Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don’t belong here."
57	Joey	 You have Knicks tickets?
58	Rachel	 Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
59	Monica	 Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.
60	Rachel	 Yeah.
61	Joey	 (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
62	Rachel	 Do you guys want these?
63	Joey	 Yeah!
64	Chandler	 Yeah we do!
65	Rachel	 Ohh, well you got ‘em.
66	Both	 All right!
67	Rachel	 Just give us our apartment back!
68	Phoebe	 Boy! I didn’t see that coming!
69	Chandler	 Are you serious?
70	Rachel	 Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
71	Monica	 Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?
72	Joey	 You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.
73	Monica	 What do you say?
74	Chandler	 Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
75	Rachel	 You’re bachelor pad?!
76	Monica	 Have you even had a girl up here?
77	Chandler	 No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
78	Joey	 Yeah, you do!
79	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.]
80	Joey	 Come on!
81	Chandler	 (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
82	Gunther	 Good one.
83	Joey	 Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
84	Chandler	 Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.
85	Joey	 Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
86	Ross	 (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
87	Joey	 Hey!
88	Chandler	 Oh my God!
89	Joey	 We don’t make enough fun of you already?
90	Ross	 Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
91	Chandler	 You do know that Wham broke up?
92	Ross	 I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
93	Joey	 Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
94	Chandler	 Where is Emily?
95	Ross	 Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
96	Chandler	 Man, didn’t she like just get here?
97	Ross	 Yeah!! Yeah!
98	Chandler	 Easy tiger.
99	Ross	 I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, "Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
100	Chandler	 So what are you going to do?
101	Ross	 Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!
102	Joey	 What?
103	Ross	 I could ask her to live with me!
104	Chandler	 Are you serious?
105	Ross	 I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
106	Chandler	 Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
107	Ross	 Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?
108	Chandler	 And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.
109	Joey	 All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!
110	Ross	 I don’t want to do that.
111	Joey	 No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!
112	Ross	 Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)
113	Chandler	 Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
114	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same day. Joey and Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.]
115	Phoebe	 That’s too hard. Too hard!
116	Monica	 (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
117	Rachel	 Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
118	Chandler	 No thank you.
119	Joey	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
120	Chandler	 Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
121	Joey	 Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
122	Chandler	 Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
123	Joey	 It’s the Knicks!
124	Chandler	 Screw the Knicks!
125	Joey	 Whoa!
126	Chandler	 I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
127	Joey	 Huh.
128	Chandler	 And the Knicks rule all.
129	Joey	 Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
130	Phoebe	 Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
131	Chandler	 No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
132	Rachel	 All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
133	Joey	 Done!
134	Rachel	 Let me finish.
135	Joey	 Oh.
136	Rachel	 I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.
137	Joey	 Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
138	Phoebe	 Or you could end up with everything.
139	Joey	 Ooh, I like that.
140	Monica	 All right, so what do you say?
141	Chandler	 No!
142	Monica	 Oh, just do it!!
143	Chandler	 Op, op, I’m convinced!
144	Joey	 Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.
145	Chandler	 All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.
146	Joey	 All right!
147	Phoebe	 Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
148	Rachel	 Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.
149	Phoebe	 Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!
150	Joey	 Okay!
151	Chandler	 Okay!
152	Phoebe	 This is great!
153	Joey	 What’s the game?! What’s the game?!
154	Phoebe	 Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
155	Monica	 They’re green?
156	Phoebe	 Good! Good! Five points!
157		(They both rejoice; Chandler is totally confused.)
158	Phoebe	 All right, Joey, same question.
159		(He looks to Chandler, who doesn’t have a clue.)
160	Joey	 Uhh, they’re tall.
161	Phoebe	 Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
162		(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didn’t come up with the answer.)
163	Monica	 That’s not even a game!
164	Rachel	 What? Shut up! We’re winning!
165	Monica	 You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
166	Chandler	 Fine, let’s do it.
167	Phoebe	 Oh, I have cards!
168	Joey	 Oh.
169	Monica	 Oh, good.
170	Phoebe	 Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
171	Chandler	 Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
172	Rachel	 Okay.
173	Monica	 Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
174	Chandler	 That’s a low one!
175	Joey	 Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t.
176	Phoebe	 What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
177	Joey	 Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
178		(Both Joey and Chandler and Monica and Rachel jump up and down for joy.)
179	Chandler	 Why are you screaming and hugging?
180	Monica	 Because we won our apartment back!
181	Joey	 What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
182	Monica	 No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
183		(They all look to Phoebe to settle this.)
184	Phoebe	 I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!
185	Rachel	 All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.
186	Joey	 Okay.
187	Rachel	 Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!
188	Joey	 Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!
189	Chandler	 Yeah baby!
190	Monica	 But, we pick again! We pick again!
191	Joey	 Why?!
192	Monica	 I don’t know!
193	Chandler	 Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside baby!
194	Joey	 Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
195	Chandler	 No they didn’t!
196	[Scene	 Ross’s apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.]
197	Ross	 Hey!
198	Emily	 I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
199	Ross	 (laughs) Move in with me.
200	Emily	 What?!
201	Ross	 Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
202	Emily	 Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
203	Ross	 I know.
204	Emily	 My job!
205	Ross	 Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
206	Emily	 Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England.
207	Ross	 No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?
208	Emily	 Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something.
209	Ross	 What?
210	Emily	 Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back!
211	Ross	 No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?
212	Emily	 Why don’t we what?
213	Ross	 Get married.
214	Emily	 You are mad!
215	Ross	 No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.
216	Emily	 We’ve only known each other for six weeks!
217	Ross	 Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?
218	Emily	 My parents are going to be really mad.
219	Ross	 Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
220	Emily	 Yes.
221		(They kiss and hug.)
222	Emily	 Yes!
223	Ross	 Yes! We’re getting married?!
224	Emily	 Oh my God!
225	Ross	 Yes!
226	Emily	 We’re getting married!
227	Ross	 Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?
228	Emily	 Yes.
229		(He tries to put it on her finger.)
230	Emily	 Ohh, it’s a bit small.
231	Ross	 Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
232	Emily	 It was.
233		(They kiss.)
234		Commerical Break
235	[Scene	 The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.]
236	Chandler	 Those were like the best seats ever.
237	Joey	 Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.
238	Chandler	 Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.
239		(He knocks on the girls’ door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using Star Trek technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow! Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesn’t even realise it.)
240	Chandler	 Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
241	Joey	 Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!
242	Chandler	 I KNOW!!!
243		(They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)
244	Chandler	 Open up! Open up! Open up!
245		(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)
246	Monica	 We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
247	Chandler	 What the hell is going on?!
248		(It’s Rachel’s turn to open the door.)
249	Rachel	 We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
250	Phoebe	 (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.
251		(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)
252	Chandler	 We are switching back, right now!
253	Monica	 No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!
254	Chandler	 Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
255	Joey	 I don’t know.
256	Chandler	 What?
257	Joey	 I don’t want to move again!
258	Chandler	 I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!
259		(They open the door.)
260	Rachel	 All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
261	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!
262	Rachel	 Let us keep the apartment and…
263	Monica	 As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
264		[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]
265	Chandler	 Totally worth it!
266	Joey	 That was one good minute!
267	Chandler	 Good night.
268	Joey	 Good night.
269		(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to close both sections of his door.)
270		[Cut to the girls apartment.]
271	Monica	 Men are such idiots.
272	Rachel	 Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
273	Phoebe	 That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
274	Monica	 Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.
275	Rachel	 Yeah.
276	Phoebe	 Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)
277	Ross	 Come on! Come on. Come on.
278	Chandler	 Okay!
279	Phoebe	 Hey!
280	Ross	 Hey!
281	Monica	 What-what’s going on?
282	Joey	 Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
283	Ross	 Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
284		(The gang is stunned.)
285	Phoebe	 What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
286	Emily	 Umm, no.
287	Monica	 When, when did—how, how did you…
288	Ross	 We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
289	Emily	 I mean, we know it’s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so…
290		(Rachel slowly walks in from her bedroom. She is stunned speechless.)
291	Ross	 (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…
292	Rachel	 Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for you!
293		(Seeing Rachel’s apparently okay with this, the rest of the gang jumps up to congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.)
294	Chandler	 Oh, well, that’s great!
295	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah!
296	Monica	 (to Ross) I can’t believe you’re getting married!
297	Ross	 Yeah. (They hug again.)
298	Joey	 Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)
299		Closing Credits
300	[Scene	 Joey’s bedroom, he is awoken by the singing guy.]
301	The Singing Man	 (singing) Morning’s here! The morning’s here!
