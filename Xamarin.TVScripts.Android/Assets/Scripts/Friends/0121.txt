2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is looking at papers.]
3	Joey	 How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
4	Monica	 I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
5	Rachel	 Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
6	Monica	 I know. It's just such reckless spending.
7	Ross	 I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
8	Chandler	 Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
9	Monica	 That's me.
10	Phoebe	 Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)
11	Ross	 Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
12	Rachel	 Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
13	Monica	 Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
14	Ross	 What? It's, it's just a phase.
15	Chandler	 Well, that's what we said about Joey...
16	Ross	 Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
17	Rachel	 (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
18	Ross	 What?
19	Rachel	 Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room.]
22	Rachel	 Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
23	Monica	 This woman's living my life.
24	Rachel	 What?
25	Monica	 She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
26	Rachel	 You're not an artist.
27	Monica	 Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
28	Rachel	 Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
29	Monica	 Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
30	Rachel	 (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
31	Monica	 Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
32	Rachel	 (Yawning) Nooo...
33	Monica	 This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
34	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]
35	Chandler	 How about Joey... Pepponi?
36	Joey	 No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
37	Chandler	 Joey... Switzerland?
38		(The waitress brings their coffee.)
39	Joey	 Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.
40	Chandler	 Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
41	Joey	 Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
42	Chandler	 Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
43	Joey	 (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
44	Chandler	 Might wanna try Joseph.
45		(Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.)
46	Joey	 Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
47	Chandler	 Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
48	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
49	Rachel	 Hey.
50	Phoebe	 Hey.
51	Monica	 Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
52	Phoebe	 What are you doing?
53	Monica	 (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.
54	Rachel	 What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
55	Monica	 This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
56	Rachel	 Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
57	Phoebe	 This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
58	[Scene	 A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]
59	Monica	 What d'you think?
60	Phoebe	 Lotsa things.
61		(They go in and sit down.)
62	Rachel	 Which one do you think she is?
63		(The teacher comes up to them.)
64	Teacher	 May I help you?
65	Monica	 Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
66	Teacher	 You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
67	Rachel	 What does she mean?
68	Phoebe	 I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare shoes)
69	Monica	 Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
70	Teacher	 (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
71	Rachel	 She could be you.
72		(Music starts)
73	Teacher	 Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
74		(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)
75	Monica	 Okay, I'm not getting this!
76	Phoebe	 (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!
77	Monica	 Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
78		(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)
79	Rachel	 What? You just click when they click.
80	Teacher	 Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
81		(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)
82	Phoebe	 Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
83	Monica	 Great. It's gym class all over again.
84	Phoebe and Rachel	 Aww.
85	Teacher	 Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
86	Monica	 Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
87		(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)
88	Woman	 It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
89	Teacher	 She's your partner.
90	Woman	 Hi. I'm Monica.
91	Monica	 Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
92	Woman	 (Fake Monica) Monana?
93	Monica	 Yeah. It's Dutch.
94	Fake Monica	 You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)
95	Monica	 Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
96	Teacher	 And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
97	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is entering.]
98	Ross	 (Mortified) Hi.
99	Chandler and Joey	 Hey.
100	Joey	 Where've you been?
101	Ross	 At the vet.
102	Chandler	 She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
103	Ross	 She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
104	Joey	 (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
105	Ross	 She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
106	Chandler	 So what does this mean?
107	Ross	 I'm gonna have to give him up.
108		Commercial Break
109	[Scene	 Central Perk, scene continued from earlier. They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.]
110	Joey	 I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
111	Chandler	 I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
112	Ross	 I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
113	Joey	 Isn't there any way you can keep him?
114	Ross	 No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
115	Joey	 How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
116	Chandler	 I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
117	Ross	 Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
118	Chandler	 Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
119		(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)
120	Phoebe	 Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
121	Chandler	 What?
122	Joey	 Did you call the cops?
123	Rachel	 Nope. We took her to lunch.
124	Chandler	 Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
125	Ross	 What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
126	Monica	 Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
127	Ross	 Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
128	Chandler	 ...Take off their hats!
129	Phoebe	 Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
130	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]
131	Rachel	 No way. No way did you do this.
132	Fake Monica	 Monana was very brave.
133	Monica	 It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
134	Fake Monica	 So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
135	Monica	 ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
136	Rachel	 Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)
137	Fake Monica	 Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
138	Monica	 'Scuse me?
139	Fake Monica	 There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
140	Monica	 Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
141	Fake Monica	 Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
142	Monica	 What?
143	Fake Monica	 Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
144	Monica	 Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
145	Fake Monica	 I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
146	Monica	 Uh-huh.
147	Fake Monica	 I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
148	Monica	 Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
149	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse. Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]
150	Ross	 (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
151	Phoebe	 I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
152	Ross	 Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
153	Rachel	 Oh, somebody will.
154	Joey	 (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
155	Chandler	 You're kidding.
156	Joey	 Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
157	Chandler	 Y'know, you'd think I would've.
158	Joey	 Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
159	Phoebe	 ...Flame Boy.
160	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]
161	Ross	 Where exactly is your zoo?
162	Dr. Baldhara	 Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
163	Ross	 Yes.
164	Dr. Baldhara	 Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
165	Ross	 No-no, he's, he's very docile.
166	Dr. Baldhara	 Even if he were... cornered?
167	Ross	 Well I, I don't know. Why?
168	Dr. Baldhara	 Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
169	Ross	 He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
170	Dr. Baldhara	 How about a hammer, or a small blade?
171	Ross	 Why- why- why would he need a blade?
172	Dr. Baldhara	 Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
173		(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)
174	Chandler and Joey	 He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
175	Joey	 We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
176	Chandler	 ...He's in.
177	Ross	 He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
178	Dr. Baldhara	 You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
179	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk.]
180	Monica	 Yo- hooo!
181	Rachel	 Where the hell've you been?
182	Monica	 Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
183	Rachel	 Are you drunk?!
184	Monica	 Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
185	Rachel	 Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
186		(Monica is drinking from the tap)
187	Rachel	 Monica? Monica!
188	Monica	 Water rules!
189	Rachel	 Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
190	Monica	 Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
191	Rachel	 Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
192	Monica	 No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
193		(The phone rings and Rachel answers)
194	Rachel	 Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
195	Monica	 Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
196	Rachel	 What?
197	Monica	 They've arrested Monica.
198	[Scene	 New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]
199	Monica	 Hi.
200	Fake Monica	 Hey.
201	Monica	 How are you?
202	Fake Monica	 I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
203	Monica	 Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
204	Fake Monica	 That I was not expecting.
205	Monica	 I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
206	Fake Monica	 Oh. Thanks.
207	Monica	 No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
208	Fake Monica	 Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
209	Monica	 I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
210	Fake Monica	 Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
211	Monica	 Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
212	Fake Monica	 There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
213	Monica	 Not necessarily...
214	Fake Monica	 Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
215	Monica	 Um, I'm not actually Amish.
216	Fake Monica	 Really? Then why are you like that?
217	[Scene	 Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]
218	Teacher	 You by the door. In or out?
219	Monica	 In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
220	Teacher	 You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
221	Monica	 Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
222	[Scene	 The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]
223	PA	 This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
224	Phoebe	 Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
225	Ross	 Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
226	Phoebe	 Oh!
227	Chandler	 Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
228	Joey	 I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
229	Ross	 Just, just say what you feel.
230	Joey	 Marcel, I'm hungry.
231	Ross	 That was good.
232	Rachel	 (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
233	Ross	 Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
234	All	 Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)
235	Ross	 Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
236		(Marcel is put in a cage and taken away.)
237		Closing Credits
238	[Scene	 A Theater, there is a casting session going on for a play.]
239	Actor	 (Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
240	Casting Director No. 1	 That's fine, thank you.
241	Casting Director No. 2	 Next. (Joey walks onstage)
242	Joey	 Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
243	Casting Director No. 2	 Name?
244	Joey	 Holden McGroin.
