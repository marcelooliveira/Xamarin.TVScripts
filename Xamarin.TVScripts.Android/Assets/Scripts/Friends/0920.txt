1	Teleplay	 Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen Story
2	[Scene	 Monica's apartment]
3	Joey	 (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
4	Chandler	 (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
5	Joey	 Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
6	Chandler	 I could fall asleep at a play.
7	Phoebe	 What is it?
8	Joey	 It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me
9	Monica	 It sounds interesting!
10	Ross	 Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)
11	Phoebe	 I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
12	Joey	 You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
13	Ross	 What? How come that you don't have to go!
14	Joey	 I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
15	Chandler	 (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
16	Rachel	 (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
17	Joey	 (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.
18	Rachel	 Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?
19	Monica	 Yeah.
20	Rachel	 Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
21	Monica	 No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
22	Rachel	 No reason.
23	Monica	 No, no, Rachel?
24	Rachel	 Yeah
25	Monica	 Who do you wanna fool around with?
26	Rachel	 (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!
27		(Monica points at Joey, Rachel turns and sees him)
28	Rachel	 (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
29	Monica	 (whispering) You can't!
30	Rachel	 (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
31	Monica	 In the hall.
32	[Scene	 In the hall]
33	Monica	 You wanna fool around with Joey?
34	Rachel	 Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
35	Monica	 Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
36	Rachel	 Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
37	Monica	 Who, who are they?
38	Rachel	 I know them from work.
39	Monica	 Both of them?
40	Rachel	 No, one of them...
41	Monica	 Which one?
42	Rachel	 I don't know, what were the names I just said?
43	Monica	 Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
44	Rachel	 All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)
45	Monica	 What the hell are you cooking!
46		Opening credits
47	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross enters]
48	Ross	 Hey!
49	Monica	 Hey!
50	Chandler	 Hey!
51	Ross	 Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
52	Chandler	 Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
53	Ross	 (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
54	Monica	 What's so bad about that?
55	Ross	 It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
56	Monica	 (fingering her elbow)
57	Ross	 (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.
58		(a woman walks in)
59	Charlie	 (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
60	Gunther	 No.
61	Ross	 Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
62	Charlie	 Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
63	Ross	 Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
64	Charlie	 It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
65	Ross	 Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
66	Monica	 (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
67	Chandler	 (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
68	Charlie	 And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
69	Ross	 Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
70	Monica	 (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
71	Ross	 (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
72	Charlie	 Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
73	Ross	 I don't think so.
74	Charlie	 I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
75	Ross	 Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
76	Charlie	 You don't think we should wait for him?
77	Ross	 You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
78	Professor Spafford	 Professor Geller?
79	Ross	 Oh, damn it!
80	[Scene	 Joey's apartment]
81		(Rachel enters the room and checks the answering machine)
82	Jane	 (from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
83	Joey	 (entering the room) Hey!
84	Rachel	 Hey!
85	Joey	 What's happenin'?
86	Rachel	 Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
87	Joey	 Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
88	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
89	Message	 "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" (Joey's upset and stops it)
90	Joey	 (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!
91	Rachel	 (angry) You are having a party tonight??
92	Joey	 Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
93	Rachel	 And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
94	Joey	 I do it every year.
95	Rachel	 You do that every year??
96	Joey	 I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
97	Rachel	 Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
98	Joey	 Yeah...
99	Rachel	 And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
100	Joey	 Yeah...
101	Rachel	 OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
102	Joey	 (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
103	Rachel	 Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
104	Joey	 You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
105	Rachel	 Well, then so you just invite me...!
106	Joey	 (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
107	Rachel	 Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
108	Joey	 Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
109	Rachel	 (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!
110	[Scene	 Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant]
111	Professor Spafford	 (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
112	Ross	 (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
113	Professor Spafford	 And that's not all I'm allergic to.
114	Ross	 (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!
115	Professor Spafford	 I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
116	Ross	 So basically all nuts?
117	Professor Spafford	 Interestingly... no.
118	Charlie	 Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
119	Professor Spafford	 If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)
120	Charlie	 Oh my God!!
121	Ross	 I've lost the will to live.
122	Charlie	 Let's ditch him!
123	Ross	 What?
124	Charlie	 Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
125	Ross	 Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
126	Charlie	 Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)
127	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment]
128	Ross	 (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
129	Phoebe	 Hi!
130	Ross	 Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
131	Phoebe	 Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
132	Charlie	 Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
133	Phoebe	 Ah, ah.
134	Charlie	 (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)
135	Ross	 (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
136	Phoebe	 Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
137	Monica	 (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?
138	Ross	 Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
139	Monica	 And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
140	Rachel	 (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
141	Ross	 Really? Wh-what's wrong?
142	Rachel	 I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
143	Charlie	 Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
144	Rachel	 ... Ok, who is this?
145	Ross	 I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
146	Rachel	 Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
147	Monica	 Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
148	Rachel	 Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
149	Monica	 You're not sick!
150	Rachel	 What? Yes, I am!
151	Monica	 Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
152	Rachel	 When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
153	Monica	 You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
154	Rachel	 Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
155	Monica	 Ok, what is this?
156	Rachel	 Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
157	Monica	 (aloud) WHAT?
158	Ross	 (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
159	Monica	 Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
160	Rachel	 And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
161	Charlie	 I thought you came to say you were sick.
162	Rachel	 Ok professor or detective?
163	Phoebe	 Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
164	Rachel	 Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
165	Phoebe	 And that horrible museum tour!
166	Ross	 No, I arranged that...
167		(Joey enters, wearing a bathrobe)
168	Joey	 (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
169	Phoebe	 We know about your party Joey.
170	Joey	 What party?
171	Monica	 The game's over! Take off your robe!
172	Joey	 (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
173	Everyone	 No!! Cover it up!!
174	Joey	 (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
175	[Scene	 The Roof]
176	Joey	 (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.
177	Monica	 Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
178	Kyle Lowder	 (to Monica) Hi. (walks on)
179	Monica	 (Yells after him) I love you!
180	Joey	 Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
181	Monica	 Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
182	Phoebe	 Hey!
183	Monica	 (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
184	Phoebe	 Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
185	Monica	 (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
186	[Scene	 The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]
187	Chandler	 Where the hell is everybody?
188		(The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)
189	Bitter lady	 (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One
190	[Scene	 The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]
191	Monica	 (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too
192	Rachel	 Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
193	Monica	 Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
194	Matthew Ashford	 It was nice to meet you Rachel.
195	Rachel	 Nice to meet you.
196	Matthew Ashford	 Call me.
197	Rachel	 Ok
198		(Matthew leaves)
199	Monica	 (yelling after him) We will!!
200	Monica	 (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
201	Rachel	 Yeah!
202	Monica	 I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
203	Rachel	 Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
204	Monica	 Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
205		(cut to Ross and Charlie)
206	Ross	 (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
207	Charlie	 Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
208	Ross	 Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
209	Charlie	 Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
210	Ross	 You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
211	Charlie	 Yeah...
212	Ross	 ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
213	Charlie	 Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
214	Ross	 Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
215	Charlie	 Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
216	Ross	 (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
217	Charlie	 Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
218	Ross	 Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
219	Charlie	 A guy who won two.
220	Ross	 (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
221	Charlie	 Yeah... for three years.
222	Ross	 Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
223	Charlie	 (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
224	Ross	 Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
225	Charlie	 No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
226	Ross	 Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
227	Phoebe	 Hey Ross!
228	Rache	 How is it going with Charlie?
229	Ross	 (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
230	Phoebe	 Oh, What's the matter?
231	Ross	 She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
232	Rachel	 I always loved that!!
233	Ross	 Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
234	Phoebe	 Worse?
235	Ross	 Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?
236	Phoebe	 (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
237	Ross	 What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
238	Rachel	 Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
239	[Scene	 Chandler in the theater]
240	Bitter lady	 Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
241	Chandler	 (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!
242	Bitter lady	 (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7
243	Chandler	 I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
244	[Scene	 The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]
245	Joey	 Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)
246	Ross	 Nice to meet you.
247	Dirk	 Hey! So what show are you on?
248	Ross	 Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
249		(Dirk is confused)
250	Joey	 It's a science.
251	Dirk	 Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
252		(Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)
253	Joey	 Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
254	Ross	 Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
255	Dirk	 Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
256	Ross	 I'd lead with that.
257		(Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)
258	Monica	 That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
259	Joey	 Monica!
260	Monica	 Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
261		(Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)
262	Joey	 (To Rachel) What have you got there?
263	Ross	 Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
264	Joey	 Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
265	Rachel	 (drunken voice) I think I am.
266	Joey	 (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
267		(Rachel is puzzled)
268	Joey	 (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
269	Rachel	 (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
270	Joey	 Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
271	Rachel	 Joey, you're so sweet.
272	Joey	 That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
273	Rachel	 Who (looks around)?
274		(Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)
275	Joey	 Me.
276	Rachel	 (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
277	Joey	 Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
278	Rachel	 Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)
279	Joey	 Gotcha.
280	Rachel	 Oh, Very funny... Joey.
281		(Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)
282		(Chandler walks in)
283	Chandler	 (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
284	Monica	 Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
285	Chandler	 Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
286	Monica	 You really liked it?
287	Chandler	 Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16
288	Monica	 Oh really!
289	Chandler	 Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
290	Monica	 No!
291	Chandler	 Did somebody sign your bra?
292	Monica	 So I got it when I was 13...
293	[Scene	 At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]
294	Phoebe	 Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
295	Ross	 It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
296	Phoebe	 Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
297	Ross	 Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
298	Phoebe	 You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
299	Ross	 And sexy.
300	Phoebe	 Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
301	Ross	 Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
302	Phoebe	 Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
303	Ross	 Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
304		(Rachel approaches Monica)
305	Rachel	 (to Monica) Hey!
306	Monica	 Hey!
307	Rachel	 I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind
308	Monica	 No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
309	Rachel	 Please, what about you and Chandler?
310	Monica	 That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
311	Rachel	 Well hello (points to herself)!
312	Monica	 What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
313	Rachel	 I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
314	Monica	 Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
315	Rachel	 (pause) I'm gonna do it.
316	Monica	 And I can't stop you.
317	Rachel	 No.
318		(Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)
319	Ross	 (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
320		(Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)
321	Ross	 I'm smarter than him!
322		Closing credits
323	[Scene	 The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]
324	Phoebe	 Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
325	Chandler	 Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
326	Monica	 Oh, you're so wonderful.
327	Bitter woman	 Why don't you like me! Chapter one
328	Chandler	 Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).
