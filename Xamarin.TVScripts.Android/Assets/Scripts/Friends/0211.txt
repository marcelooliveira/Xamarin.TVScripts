2		[at Ross's. Carol and Susan are picking Ben up]
3	ROSS	 Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
4	CAROL	 So how did everything go?
5	ROSS	 Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
6	CAROL	 Well, we've gotta go.
7	ROSS	 Ok.
8	SUSAN	 [clears her throat]
9	CAROL	 Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
10	ROSS	 Oh, you and me?
11	CAROL	 Uh, no, Susan and me.
12	SUSAN	 The other us.
13	ROSS	 Ok.
14	CAROL	 We're uh, we're getting married.
15	ROSS	 As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
16	CAROL	 Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
17	ROSS	 Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
18	CAROL	 Look I just thought that...
19	ROSS	 No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
20	SUSAN	 Is your finger caught in that chair?
21	ROSS	 Mmm hmmm.
22	CAROL	 Want us to go?
23	ROSS	 Uh-huh.
24		[at Rachel and Monica's]
25	ROSS	 This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
26	JOEY	 It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
27	MONICA	 Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
28	ROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY	 Yes!
29	MONICA	 They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
30	ROSS	 Would it matter?
31	MONICA	 Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!
32	JOEY	 Are you really not going?
33	ROSS	 I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
34	MONICA	 They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
35	ROSS	 If you wanna call that a reason.
36	CHANDLER	 [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
37	MONICA	 Ross, I thought you were over this.
38	ROSS	 Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
39	JOEY	 Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
40	RACHEL	 [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
41	JOEY	 No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
42	CHANDLER	 Whoa, she's pretty.
43	JOEY	 Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
44	RACHEL	 I'm sorry, what?
45	MONICA	 What?
46	JOEY	 It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
47	CHANDLER	 Oh, ok.
48	JOEY	 There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
49	MRS. WALLACE	 Is she gonna be all right?
50	JOEY	 I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
51	CHANDLER	 Nice!
52	RACHEL	 That's great!
53	ROSS	 Excellent!
54	CHANDLER	 For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
55		[Monica and Rachel's]
56	ROSS	 That is so good! Do it again!
57	JOEY	 All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
58	CHANDLER	 That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
59	ROSS	 No no, that's me.
60	CHANDLER	 Oh, yeah.
61	ROSS	 Oh, hello.
62	PHOEBE	 Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
63	ROSS	 Is everything ok?
64	PHOEBE	 Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
65	ROSS	 Oh my god.
66	CHANDLER	 That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
67	PHOEBE	 Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
68	MONICA	 Oh, honey.
69	PHOEBE	 Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
70	RACHEL	 What do you mean?
71	PHOEBE	 I think it went into me.
72		[Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe]
73		[Central Perk]
74	MONICA	 God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
75	CHANDLER	 Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
76	RACHEL	 Ok, who ordered what?
77	ROSS	 Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
78	CHANDLER	 Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
79	RACHEL	 Oh god.
80	JOEY	 I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
81	RACHEL	 I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
82	PHOEBE	 [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
83	JOEY	 Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
84	PHOEBE	 I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!
85	MRS. GREEN	 [entering] There she is.
86	RACHEL	 Mom!
87	MRS GREEN	 Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
88	RACHEL	 Pretty much.
89	MRS GREEN	 Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
90	RACHEL	 This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
91	MRS GREEN	 Oh hello, Ross.
92	ROSS	 Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]
93	MRS GREEN	 So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
94	RACHEL	 Oh Mom!
95	MRS GREEN	 If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
96	CHANDLER	 Believe me, sometimes that happens.
97	MRS GREEN	 This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
98	RACHEL	 Really?
99	MRS GREEN	 Yes.
100	PHOEBE	 I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
101	JOEY	 Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
102	PHOEBE	 I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
103		[at Rachel and Monica's
104	MRS GREEN	 Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
105	RACHEL	 Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
106	MRS GREEN	 [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.
107	RACHEL	 I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
108	MRS GREEN	 I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
109	RACHEL	 For...me.
110	MRS GREEN	 Well, not just for you.
111	RACHEL	 Well, what do you mean?
112	MRS GREEN	 I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
113	MONICA	 [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
114	RACHEL	 Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
115	MONICA	 Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
116	ROSS	 And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
117	RACHEL	 None.
118	JOEY	 They didn't fight a lot?
119	RACHEL	 No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
120	PHOEBE	 [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.
121	JOEY	 Hey, look who's up.
122	RACHEL	 I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
123	MONICA	 Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
124	RACHEL	 Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
125	CHANDLER	 You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
126	PHOEBE	 That's him.
127	CHANDLER	 Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
128	MR A	 Phoebe?
129	PHOEBE	 Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
130	MR A	 Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
131	PHOEBE	 Um, do you wanna sit?
132	MR A	 Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
133	PHOEBE	 I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
134	MR A	 You're saying, my wife is in you?
135	PHOEBE	 Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
136	MR A	 Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
137	PHOEBE	 Everything?
138	MR A	 Everything.
139	PHOEBE	 Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
140	MR A	 Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
141	PHOEBE	 I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
142	MR A	 [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?
143		[Joey nods and shrugs.]
144	MRS GREEN	 Look at this.
145	RACHEL	 These are from Halloween three years ago.
146	MRS GREEN	 Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
147	RACHEL	 No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
148	MONICA	 Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
149	RACHEL	 Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
150	MONICA	 Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
151	RACHEL	 Hey, Mon, you want some help?
152	MONICA	 If you want.
153	PHOEBE	 [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
154	RACHEL	 She's still with you?
155	PHOEBE	 Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.
156	MRS GREEN	 This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
157	RACHEL	 God!
158	MONICA	 All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
159	MRS GREEN	 That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
160	RACHEL	 Oh! What's new in sex?
161	MRS GREEN	 The only man I've ever been with is your father.
162	MONICA	 I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
163	MRS GREEN	 I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
164	RACHEL	 Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
165	MRS GREEN	 No.
166	RACHEL	 You want me to talk you out of it?
167	MRS GREEN	 No.
168	RACHEL	 Then what? What do you want?
169	MRS GREEN	 I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
170	RACHEL	 Why on earth would I understand this?
171	MRS GREEN	 You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
172	RACHEL	 Oh.
173	MONICA	 All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
174	CHANDLER	 Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
175	MONICA	 Joey, speed it up!
176	JOEY	 I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
177	PHOEBE	 Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
178	MONICA	 Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
179	PHOEBE	 Sir! No sir!
180	MONICA	 [to Ross] All right, you!
181	ROSS	 No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
182	MONICA	 All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
183	CHANDLER	 Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
184		[knock at the door]
185	MONICA	 Hi.
186	CAROL	 How's it going?
187	MONICA	 It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]
188	CAROL	 Fine, whatever.
189	ROSS	 What's the matter?
190	CAROL	 Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
191	ROSS	 What?
192	MONICA	 You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
193	ROSS	 Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
194	CAROL	 My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
195	ROSS	 Oh my god.
196	CAROL	 I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
197	ROSS	 It's ok. I'm sorry.
198	CAROL	 And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
199	ROSS	 I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
200	CAROL	 You do?
201	ROSS	 Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
202	CAROL	 Of course I do.
203	ROSS	 Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
204	CAROL	 You're right. Of course you're right.
205	MONICA	 So we're back on?
206	CAROL	 We're back on.
207	MONICA	 You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
208		[at the wedding]
209	JOEY	 It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
210	CHANDLER	 Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
211		[Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]
212	PHOEBE	 [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
213		[Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]
214	CAROL	 Thank you.
215	ROSS	 Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]
216	CAROL	 Ross. [He lets her go]
217	MINISTER	 You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
218	PHOEBE	 [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
219		[At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture taken.]
220	MONICA	 Would you look at them?
221	ROSS	 Yeah, can't help but.
222	JOEY	 [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.
223	PHOEBE	 I miss Rose.
224	CHANDLER	 Oh, yeah?
225	PHOEBE	 I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
226	WOMAN	 You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
227	PHOEBE	 Ok, that's so nice.
228		[Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe doesn't see him.]
229	CHANDLER	 [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]
230	RACHEL	 Hey, Mom? Having fun?
231	MRS GREEN	 Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
232	RACHEL	 There's more alcohol, right?
233		[Susan approaches Ross, who's looking lonely]
234	SUSAN	 How you doin'?
235	ROSS	 Ok.
236	SUSAN	 You did a good thing today.
237	ROSS	 Yeah.
238	SUSAN	 You wanna dance?
239	ROSS	 No, that's fine.
240	SUSAN	 Come on. I'll let you lead.
241	ROSS	 Ok.
242		[They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]
243	CHANDLER	 [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.]
244		[at Monica and Rachel's]
245	MONICA	 Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
246	ROSS	 Well, Mon, I was married.
247	PHOEBE	 Yeah, me, too, technically.
248	RACHEL	 I had a wedding.
249	MONICA	 All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
250	JOEY	 I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]
251	CHANDLER	 Isn't Ben in this?
252	ALL	 Oh, yeah!
