3	Ross	 Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
4	Chandler	 Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?
5	Rachel	 Who wrote it?
6	Ross	 Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
7	Joey	 Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
8	Ross	 Yeah.
9	Joey	 Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)
10	Chandler	 A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
11	Rachel	 Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
12	Ross	 It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.
13	Chandler	 Oh, is that against the rules?
14	Ross	 No, but it is frowned upon.
15	Chandler	 I see.
16	Ross	 Besides, there’s a big age difference.
17	Joey	 Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…
18	Ross	 I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.
19	Joey	 No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are eating breakfast as Joey enters.]
22	Joey	 Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
23	Chandler	 Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
24	Phoebe	 What’s a Movement class?
25	Monica	 It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.
26	Joey	 Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
27	Chandler	 Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
28	Joey	 No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
29	Chandler	 You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…
30	Joey	 Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
31	Chandler	 Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.
32	Joey	 All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
33	Chandler	 Yeah so, Tuesday?
34	Joey	 (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
35	Chandler	 (sarcastically) Thank you.
36	Joey	 Okay.
37	Rachel	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
38	Chandler	 You just thought of that in there?
39	Monica	 Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
40		(Rachel dials her number.)
41	Rachel	 (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
42	Monica	 You’re on the phone!
43	Rachel	 (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
44	Phoebe	 Oh my God! How bad was it?
45	Rachel	 Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
46	Monica	 Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
47	Chandler	 What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
48	Joey	 The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
49	[Scene	 N.Y.U. Paleontology department, Ross is putting up the grades on the message board.]
50	Burt	 (another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student, Elizabeth, approaches.)
51	Elizabeth	 Professor Geller?
52	Ross	 (startled) Yeah?
53	Elizabeth	 I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
54	Ross	 Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
55	Elizabeth	 Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation…
56	Ross	 That was you?
57	Elizabeth	 Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
58	Ross	 Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.
59	Elizabeth	 Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not my teacher anymore.
60	Ross	 What time?
61	Elizabeth	 (checks her grade) Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
62	Ross	 Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
63	Elizabeth	 I’m kidding!
64	Ross	 Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
65	[Scene	 Phoebe and Rachel's, everyone minus Ross are arriving to inspect the damage. The fire department is still there.]
66	Phoebe	 Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!
67		(They start to look around seeing that the living room is undamaged.)
68	Monica	 Oh well, it’s not so bad.
69	Fireman #1	 Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
70	Phoebe	 Oh!
71	Rachel	 My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
72	Joey	 (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
73	Fireman #1	 Excuse me?
74	Monica	 Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in that.
75		(Phoebe and Rachel return)
76	Joey	 Oh, how bad is it?
77	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
78	Chandler	 How’s your room Rach?
79	Rachel	 Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.)
80	Monica	 Isn’t that mine?
81	Rachel	 Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
82	Fireman #1	 So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
83	Rachel	 (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
84	Monica	 (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
85	Chandler	 Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
86	Fireman #1	 Well uh, do either of you smoke?
87	Phoebe	 No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
88	Fireman #1	 No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
89	Phoebe	 Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
90	Rachel	 Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.
91	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is on the phone as Joey enters.]
92	Chandler	 God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!
93	Joey	 Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler nods yes.)
94	Chandler	 (on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.
95	Joey	 Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.)
96	Chandler	 Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
97	Joey	 When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
98	Chandler	 (on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
99	Joey	 Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?
100		(Monica enters.)
101	Chandler	 Hi.
102	Monica	 Hey!
103	Chandler	 (To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.
104	Joey	 Ah-ha!
105	Monica	 Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?
106	Chandler	 Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
107	Monica	 You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
108	Chandler	 No, we only went out once.
109	Monica	 You dated her!
110	Chandler	 Not once!
111	Monica	 All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
112	Joey	 Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
113	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is having coffee with Dana.]
114	Chandler	 (laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.
115	Dana	 Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
116	Chandler	 (giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.
117	Dana	 Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know I-I-I haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
118	Chandler	 Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.
119	Dana	 No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
120	Chandler	 The nerve huh?
121	Dana	 Yeah!
122	Chandler	 Refill?
123	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is about to debut Hotel Monica (formerly known as Rachel’s Room) to Phoebe and Rachel.]
124	Monica	 Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
125		(They walk into a completely redecorated and repainted room. And of course, the room is immaculate. Only an obsessive-compulsive like Monica could find fault with the room.)
126	Rachel	 Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
127	Monica	 I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.
128	Phoebe	 Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.
129	Rachel	 Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
130	Phoebe	 Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
131	Rachel	 Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
132	Monica	 So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
133	Rachel	 I have.
134	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Joey is showing Phoebe around.]
135	Joey	 This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And uh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
136	Phoebe	 What’s that smell?
137	Joey	 I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
138	[Scene	 A street, Ross is walking with Elizabeth on their date.]
139	Elizabeth	 Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
140	Ross	 What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
141	Elizabeth	 Who?
142	Ross	 Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
143	Elizabeth	 Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
144	Ross	 Umm, no. No.
145	Elizabeth	 Yes you did! What was it?
146	Ross	 Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
147	Elizabeth	 Ohh that’s so sweet!
148	Ross	 Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
149	Burt	 (exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!
150	Ross	 (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
151	[Scene	 Phoebe and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are cleaning up the mess.]
152	Phoebe	 So did you sleep well last night?
153	Rachel	 I did.
154	Phoebe	 Yeah?
155	Rachel	 I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
156	Phoebe	 Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
157	Rachel	 What?
158	Phoebe	 Gum!
159	Fireman #2	 Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
160	Phoebe	 Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
161	Fireman #2	 No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks like a curling iron.
162	Phoebe	 I don’t use a curling iron.
163	Fireman #2	 Well someone does.
164		(Phoebe looks at Rachel.)
165	Rachel	 Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
166	Fireman #2	 It could’ve been a hair straightener.
167	Rachel	 Oh.
168	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Joey is now showing Rachel around.]
169	Joey	 This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.) And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.)
170		Commercial Break
171	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is reading and Monica runs over and turns on the lamp behind Phoebe.]
172	Monica	 Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
173	Phoebe	 Thanks Monica!
174	Monica	 Does that smell bother you?
175	Phoebe	 What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
176	Monica	 Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.
177	Phoebe	 I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
178	Monica	 Okay!
179	Phoebe	 Okay.
180		(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
181	Monica	 Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.
182	Phoebe	 Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?!
183		[Cut to Joey’s, he’s on the phone.]
184	Joey	 (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh… Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
185	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Ross is telling Monica and Joey about his date with Elizabeth.]
186	Ross	 We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
187	Monica	 So it’s okay to date a student.
188	Ross	 Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
189	Monica	 Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.
190	Ross	 Yeah. What-what should I do?
191	Joey	 Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
192	Monica	 Joey that is so sweet.
193		(He turns his back to Monica and does the international sign for big boobies again.)
194	Chandler	 (entering) Hey.
195	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
196	Chandler	 I couldn’t do it.
197	Joey	 You couldn’t do it?!
198	Chandler	 Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
199	Monica	 What?! You’re going out with her again!
200	Ross	 Going out with who?
201	Chandler	 Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
202	Ross	 Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big boobies.)
203	Chandler	 No, that was Dana Caplin.
204	The Guys	 Ohhhh! (They all look up in a moment of reflection.)
205	Monica	 Joey! You didn’t even know her!
206	Joey	 Ah whatever!
207	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Chandler is having dinner with Dana.]
208	Chandler	 Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
209	Dana	 Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
210	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
211	Dana	 Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.
212	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!
213	Dana	 I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
214	Chandler	 No-no—Really?!
215	Dana	 Of course!
216	Chandler	 (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…
217	Dana	 Ohh, I’m sorry.
218	Chandler	 Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
219	Dana	 What?! Anything! Anything!
220	Chandler	 Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
221	Dana	 Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
222	Chandler	 Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
223	[Scene	 Hotel Monica, Phoebe is on the bed playing her guitar as Monica enters.]
224	Monica	 Hey! How’s it goin’?
225	Phoebe	 Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
226	Monica	 Yes it has! I made cookies!
227	Phoebe	 Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
228	Monica	 But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.
229	Phoebe	 Okay. (Reaches for one.)
230	Monica	 (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
231	Phoebe	 (gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second.
232	Monica	 Okay!
233		(Monica leaves and Phoebe closes the door behind her and tries to lock it.)
234	Monica	 (opening the door) What are you doing?
235	Phoebe	 That doesn’t lock does it?
236	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are eating spaghetti in the living room while watching TV and Rachel drops some on the floor.]
237	Rachel	 Oh, Joey! Sorry!
238	Joey	 No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
239	Rachel	 Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
240	Joey	 Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
241	Rachel	 Really?
242	Joey	 Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
243	Rachel	 I’ve never lived like this before.
244	Joey	 I know.
245		(Rachel throws some of hers down.)
246	Joey	 All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)
247	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Elizabeth are deciding what to do on their second date.]
248	Ross	 What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
249	Elizabeth	 Uhh, I can’t.
250	Ross	 Oh, you have some studying to do?
251	Elizabeth	 No, I have some turning 21 to do.
252	Ross	 Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to… (He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
253	Elizabeth	 What are you doing?
254	Ross	 Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!
255	Elizabeth	 Do you not want to be seen with me?
256	Ross	 What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
257	Elizabeth	 Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave.
258	Ross	 What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
259	Elizabeth	 Hi!
260	Lydia	 Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?
261	Ross	 That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
262	Mel	 You are so fired.
263	Ross	 What?
264	Burt	 They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’s against the rules.
265	Ross	 Really? Its not just frowned upon?
266	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are throwing huge spitballs at the entertainment center.]
267	Rachel	 I love it at Joey’s!
268	Joey	 Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)
269	Chandler	 (entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!
270	Rachel	 Thanks!
271	Chandler	 (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?
272	Joey	 Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.) You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)
273	Chandler	 Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
274	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey! Hi!
275	Rachel	 Hi!
276	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
277	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
278	Phoebe	 Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
279	Rachel	 No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.
280	Phoebe	 Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
281	Chandler	 Really?
282	Phoebe	 Yeah she said something about crumbies.
283	Chandler	 No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
284	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
285	Joey	 That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.
286	Rachel	 No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
287	Phoebe	 No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
288	Rachel	 I know. I’m sorry.
289	Phoebe	 All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
290	Joey	 Yeah.
291	Phoebe	 God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)
292	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross is looking at his handbook. Elizabeth is also there.]
293	Ross	 Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
294	Elizabeth	 For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
295	Ross	 I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
296	Elizabeth	 Wow!
297	Ross	 What?
298	Elizabeth	 Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot.
299	Ross	 Really?
300	Elizabeth	 Yeah.
301	Ross	 Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.
302	Elizabeth	 Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)
303	Ross	 (feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
304	Elizabeth	 Shut the book!
305		(They frantically start making out.)
306	Ross	 Let’s also get a hot plate!
307		(They start making out again.)

315	Joey	 Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs—(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)
