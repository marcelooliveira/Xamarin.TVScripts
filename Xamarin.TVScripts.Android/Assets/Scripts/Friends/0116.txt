2	[Scene	 Rift’s Restaurant, as seen in Mad About You, Joey and Chandler are there.]
3	Chandler	 This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.
4		(Ursula Buffay, Phoebe’s identical twin sister, is waiting on tables in her inimitable manner.)
5	Joey	 There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
6		(Ursula spins around looking puzzled, quite unable to tell where the sound is coming from.)
7	Chandler	 It’s Phoebe! Hi!
8		(Ursula notices Joey waving his hand, and comes over.)
9	Ursula	 Hi. Okay, will that be all?
10	Chandler	 Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
11	Ursula	 Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I’m here.
12	Joey	 No, no... how come you are working here?
13	Ursula	 Right, yeah, ’cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
14	Chandler	 Can we start over?
15	Ursula	 Yeah. Okay great. I’m gonna be over here. (She wanders away.)
16	Chandler and Joey	 No, no, no!
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 A wintry February day in New York City, snowplows are clearing the streets. Inside Central Perk, all three girls are paying court to Ross.]
19	Ross	 I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
20	Rachel	 No, yeah, I’ve done that.
21	Ross	 And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
22	Rachel	 I’ve never done that.
23		(Outside in the street, Joey and Chandler arrive, to peer through the window at Phoebe, by bending down to look underneath the shop’s sign—a large steaming cup of coffee.)
24	Chandler	 All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.
25	Joey	 I’m sayin’ I see a difference.
26	Chandler	 They’re twins!
27	Joey	 I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!
28		(Joey and Chandler come indoors.)
29	Chandler	 You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
30	Joey	 Yeah.
31	Chandler	 Let’s not do that any more.
32		(They hang up their coats and scarves, then approach their friends on the main sofa.)
33	All	 Hey guys! Hey!
34	Joey	 Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
35	Phoebe	 Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
36	Joey	 Nope.
37	Phoebe	 Morly Safer.
38	Joey	 Nope.
39	Phoebe	 The woman who cuts my hair!
40	Monica	 Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
41	Chandler	 Your sister Ursula.
42	Phoebe	 (Her face dropping) Oh, really.
43	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
44	Phoebe	 Rift’s. Yeah, I know.
45	Chandler	 Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.
46	Phoebe	 Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
47	Joey	 Not from where I was standin’.
48	Phoebe	 (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?
49	Rachel	 Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?
50	Phoebe	 It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
51	Ross	 Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.
52	Chandler	 Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
53	Rachel	 So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
54	Ross	 No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
55	Rachel	 Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?
56	Ross	 No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I’m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
57	Monica	 Ross, that’s my jacket.
58	Ross	 I know.
59		(Rachel grins as Ross removes the girlie jacket, grabs his own, and rushes out.)
60	[Scene	 The Lamaze class, several couples and one trio sit on the floor, introducing themselves to the teacher, who’s got as far as a woman sitting next to Ross, Carol, and Susan.]
61	Woman	 Hi, we’re the Rostins. Err, I’m J.C., and he’s Michael, and we’re having a boy, and a girl.
62	Teacher	 Good for you. Alrighty, next?
63	Ross	 Hi, um, I’m err, (has to clear his throat) I’m Ross Geller, and err ah... (pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh, (points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s, just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent until) ..who’s next?
64	Teacher	 I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?
65	Ross	 Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend...
66	Carol	 Life partner.
67	Ross	 Like buddies.
68	Susan	 Like lovers.
69	Ross	 You know how close women can get.
70		(The teacher smiles, but her eyebrows go up. Susan and Carol pat each other affectionately.)
71	Carol	 Susan and I live together.
72	Ross	 Although I was married to her.
73	Susan	 Carol, not me.
74	Ross	 Err, right.
75	Carol	 It’s a little complicated.
76	Ross	 A little.
77	Susan	 But we’re fine.
78	Ross	 Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah! That’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.
79	[Scene 	 Chandler's Office, Chandler is working.]
80		(Helen’s buzzer is heard on the intercom, so Chandler presses his button, too.)
81	Chandler	 And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.
82	Helen	 (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
83	Chandler	 Oh, okay. Send her in.
84		(He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the door.)
85	Nina	 Hi.
86	Chandler	 Hi, Nina. Come on in.
87	Nina	 You wanted to see me?
88	Chandler	 Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
89	Nina	 Which is bad, because?
90	Chandler	 Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
91	Nina	 Your... excuse me?
92	Chandler	 WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
93	Nina	 Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. I wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
94		(Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once he’s lost for something to say &ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that he’s thinking correctly...)
95	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, and the girls are dividing some Chinese takeout, while the sitcom Family Matters is playing on the TV.]
96	Chandler	 It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.
97	Ross	 It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.
98		(Marcel scampers about, interfering with the neatness.)
99	Monica	 Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.
100	Ross	 Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
101		(Marcel points the remote at Monica’s television, pressing a particular combination of keys. The logo SAP appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is dubbed into Spanish.)
102	Monica	 Great.
103	Ross	 Relax, I’ll fix it.
104	Rachel	 (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
105	Ross	 (looking at the remote) How did he do this?
106	Chandler	 (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
107		(Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their welcome.)
108	Monica	 Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.
109	Rachel	 Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica’s note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?
110		(Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.)
111	Chandler	 Hey, where you been?
112	Joey	 I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
113	Chandler	 Score.
114	Joey	 She is so hot!
115	Chandler	 Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
116	Joey	 Pheebs?
117	Phoebe	 (Jumping up) Yeah?
118	Joey	 You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
119	Phoebe	 Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
120	Joey	 So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.
121	Phoebe	 Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart, so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay.
122	Joey	 Cool, thanks.
123		(He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits. Rachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.)
124	Ross	 You okay?
125	Phoebe	 Yeah I’m fine.
126	Ross	 You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
127		(The sitcom begins with its familiar refrain, yet with a Latin lilt. Rachel and Monica do a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the rhythm.)
128	[Scene	 Lamaze class. Susan is there. Each couple has a doll, for they have just finished learning how to change a diaper. As Ross rushes in, stepping on the Rostins’ pretend baby, squashing its head flat. It bleats, in protest. He performs emergency surgery, then hands the doll back to J.C.]
129	Ross	 Sorry.
130	Ross	 Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?
131	Susan	 Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I’ll get the information.
132	Ross	 No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what’s going on.
133	Susan	 Oh, good. This’ll be fun.
134	Teacher	 Alrighty. We’re gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don’t you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy’s head.
135		(Ross and Susan each gesture for the other to lie down.)
136	Ross and Susan	 What? What? What?
137	Susan	 I am supposed to be the mommy?
138	Ross	 Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.
139	Susan	 Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I’m a woman.
140	Ross	 I see. So what do you propose to do?
141	Susan	 I will flip you for it.
142	Ross	 Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
143	Susan	 (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.
144		(Ross gets down like all the other mothers, cradled in Susan’s lap like all the other fathers.)
145	Teacher	 Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
146		(Forgetting herself, Susan does the "Mommy" action with Ross.)
147	Teacher	 Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
148		(Ross comes out of character to glare into the distance.)
149	[Scene	 Chandler's Office. Chandler is playing with a toy as his boss Mr. Douglas knocks and opens the door.]
150	Chandler	 Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?
151	Mr. Douglas	 Ohh, it’s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
152	Chandler	 And?
153	Mr. Douglas	 It’s pretty ugly. We haven’t seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
154	Chandler	 So what does this mean?
155	Mr. Douglas	 Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department.
156	Chandler	 Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
157	Mr. Douglas	 Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
158	[Scene	 Chandler's Office, later that day, Nina is in his office.]
159	Chandler	 Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
160		(She sympathetically reaches out to fondle the inner thigh of his left leg.)
161	Nina	 Are you okay?
162	Chandler	 (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.
163	Nina	 (Taking her hand away) What?
164	Chandler	 (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
165		(Nina gasps in surprise and relief.)
166	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe.]
167	Rachel	 So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
168	Phoebe	 Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
169	Rachel	 Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
170	Phoebe	 Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
171	Rachel	 Ooh, okay... good.
172		(Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow enter the coffee house. They look about them as Jamie removes her coat and scarf.)
173	Jamie	 What is this place?
174	Fran	 Look, you’re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign) ..there’s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
175		(Jamie notices Phoebe sitting at the counter.)
176	Jamie	 I think we have an answer.
177	Fran	 What’s she doing here?
178	Jamie	 This could be God’s way of telling us to eat at home.
179	Fran	 Think she got fired at Riff’s?
180	Jamie	 No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory) ..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies’ bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?
181	Fran	 I’m gonna wait till after we order. It’s her, right.
182	Jamie	 It looks like her.
183		(Phoebe walks by, ignoring the two strangers.)
184	Jamie	 Um, excuse me.
185	Phoebe	 Yeah?
186	Jamie	 Hi, it’s us.
187	Phoebe	 (Smiling blankly) Right, and it’s me.
188	Jamie	 So, so you’re here too?
189	Phoebe	 Much as you are.
190	Jamie	 (Without moving her lips) Your turn.
191	Fran	 Err... we know what we want.
192	Phoebe	 (Philosophically) Oh, that’s good.
193	Jamie	 All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
194	Fran	 And some biscottie cookies.
195	Phoebe	 Good choice.
196		(Phoebe turns away so that the two weird women won’t see the face she pulls, and sits down.)
197	Jamie	 Definitely her.
198	Fran	 Yeah.
199		Commercial break
200	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is watching a Spanish version of The Waltons. At a nearby table sit Monica knitting, Rachel winding a ball of wool, and Chandler supplying them both from a skein which is spread between his hands.]
201		(Phoebe uses the remote to stop the Spanish by turning off the television.)
202	Monica	 I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?
203	Chandler	 Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
204	Monica	 Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.
205	Chandler	 I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?
206	Rachel	 Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating. (Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, you’re fired, but how ’bout a quickie before I go to work?"
207		(Joey lets himself in, carrying a large paper shopping bag.)
208	Joey	 Hey.
209	Rachel and Chandler	 Hey.
210		(There is a loud knocking at the door through which Joey has just entered.)
211	Chandler	 You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.
212	Monica	 I’ll get it.
213		(She rises, dragging Chandler along by the wool. Rachel has to leap over a chair to follow them. Monica opens the door to find Mr. Heckles standing there.)
214	Monica	 Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
215	Mr.Heckles	 You’re doing it again.
216	Monica	 We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, quietly.
217	Mr.Heckles	 I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep.
218	Rachel	 You don’t even have cats.
219	Mr.Heckles	 I could have cats.
220	Monica	 (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
221	Rachel	 We’ll try to keep it down.
222		(The wool-bound trio returns to the table. Rachel has to rush ahead to avoid becoming tangled. Joey brings the shopping bag over to Phoebe, and takes out a nice cardigan.)
223	Joey	 Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
224	Phoebe	 Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...
225	Joey	 Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
226	Phoebe	 Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.
227		(The others have been taking all this in.)
228	Rachel	 Are you seein’ her again tonight?
229	Joey	 Yep. Ice Capades.
230	Chandler	 Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
231	Joey	 I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s uh, somethin’ about her.
232	Phoebe	 That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. You like her. Great!
233		(The circle freezes in apprehension.)
234	Joey	 Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
235	Phoebe	 Alright, well, maybe now it’s not okay.
236	Joey	 Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.
237	Phoebe	 Okay.
238		(An embarrassed silence... finally broken by)
239	Chandler	 Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
240		(Monica frantically bursts into action as Rachel resumes winding, tangling Chandler’s wool.)
241	[Scene	 Chandler's Office, Chandler & Nina are locked in a passionate embrace. Someone knocks, so they hurriedly separate to stare out of the window. Chandler’s boss opens the door.]
242	Chandler	 And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.
243	Mr. Douglas	 Nina.
244	Nina	 Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie.
245		(She escapes, fortunately so distracting Mr. Douglas, that he misses Chandler’s expression of alarm & guilt.)
246	Mr. Douglas	 (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Nina’s shapely departure) She’s still here.
247	Chandler	 Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
248		(Thinking quickly, Chandler desperately tries to remember anything to do with schizophrenia....)
249	Chandler	 And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
250	Mr. Douglas	 You’re kidding? She seems so...
251	Chandler	 Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
252	Mr. Douglas	 That’s unbelievable.
253	Chandler	 And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
254	Mr. Douglas	 I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside a person’s head.
255	Chandler	 Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.
256		(Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning to follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?)
257	[Scene	 Lamaze class, Ross is again on the floor, cradled in Susan’s lap, but now Carol is cradled in his lap, and she has a pretend baby, on her lap. The teacher is showing her class a video, which is about to end.]
258	Soothing male voice	 ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
259	Teacher	 Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our final class.
260		(People start getting up. Ross grabs Carol’s doll to hold it upside down like a football, slapping it with his other hand.)
261	Ross	 Susan, go deep.
262		(Susan just glares back, as Ross’s inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a bubble is about to burst...)
263	Carol	 This is impossible. It’s just impossible.
264	Susan	 What is, honey?
265	Carol	 What that woman... did. I am not doin’ that. It’s just gonna have to stay in, that’s all, everything will be the same, it’ll just stay in.
266	Ross	 Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s gonna be alright.
267	Carol	 (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
268	Susan	 Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
269		(Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his "football," then manipulates the head & limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents.)
270	Susan	 I know it’s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it’s over, we’re all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
271		(Ross is staring blankly into space.)
272	Susan	 I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
273	[Scene 13	 Central Perk, the gang is gathered around Monica comforting her brother, who in a slight state of shock is cuddling a cushion for security.]
274	Ross	 I’m gonna be a father.
275	Rachel	 This is just occurring to you?
276	Ross	 I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
277	Rachel	 (She comforts him too) Oh, you’re gonna be great!
278	Ross	 Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
279	Chandler	 You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
280		(Joey tires of this, so he gets up to leave.)
281	Phoebe	 Where’re you going?
282	Joey	 Out.
283	Phoebe	 With?
284	Joey	 (Spreading his arms wide) Yes.
285	Phoebe	 Alright, could I just ask you one question?
286		(Joey nods his head.)
287	Phoebe	 Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
288	Joey	 Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t, okay?
289		(Joey walks toward the door, then hesitates and turns back.)
290	Joey	 You meant sex, right?
291		(Phoebe buttons her lip, while the rest of the gang pretend they’re not there.)
292	[Scene	 Chandler's Office, Chandler is working as Nina knocks, then opens the door.]
293	Nina	 Do you have a sec?
294	Chandler	 Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?
295	Nina	 I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
296	Chandler	 Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.
297	Nina	 Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.
298	Chandler	 Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.
299	Nina	 I am?
300	Chandler	 Sure, why not?
301	Nina	 Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You’re amazing!
302	Chandler	 Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
303	Helen	 (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
304	Nina	 What?
305	Chandler	 Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
306		(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)
307	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are sharing a bowl of popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set.]
308	Chandler	 Well, I ended up telling her everything.
309	Rachel	 Oh, how’d she take it?
310	Chandler	 Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip
311	Monica	 Okay, I think I get how to do this.
312		(Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book, but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.)
313	Phoebe	 Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can’t, I can’t watch.
314	Monica	 (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they’re gone.
315	Phoebe	 Okay.
316	Monica	 Are you alright?
317	Phoebe	 Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula thing, it’s...
318	Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
319	Phoebe	 Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
320	Monica and Rachel	 (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.
321	Phoebe	 Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
322	Rachel	 Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
323	Phoebe	 I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
324	Chandler	 You’re not gonna lose him.
325	Monica	 Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
326	Phoebe	 Yeah. Okay.
327	Ross	 No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
328	Phoebe	 But he’s falling in love with her.
329	Rachel	 Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious.
330	Phoebe	 Okay... Okay.
331		(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)
332	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, oh.
333		(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey’s apartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her identical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joey’s shirts.)
334	Ursula	 (Surprised) Oh.
335		(Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as though she owns the place.)
336	Ursula	 Yeah, um, may we help you?
337		Closing Credits
338	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is taking down the Christmas lights. Monica sees her, so she leans out of the small side window.]
339	Monica	 Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
340	Rachel	 No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa! (Screams.)
341		(Rachel slips, loses her balance, and falls over the edge..)
342	Monica	 Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!
343		(In the apartment below, Mr.Heckles is trying to relax and read his newspaper, but Rachel is helplessly dangling upside-down with her ankle wrapped up in the Christmas lights.)
344	Rachel	 (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
345	Mr.Heckles	 See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
