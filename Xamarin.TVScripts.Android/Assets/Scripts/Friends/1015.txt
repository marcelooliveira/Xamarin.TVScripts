5		[Flashback scene from last week, Monica and Chandler's kitchen, Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there.]
6	Jennifer	 Previously on Friends...
7	Chandler	 How did the job stuff go?
8	Rachel	 He offered me one.
9	Ross	 (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
10	Rachel	 The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
11		FADE OUT
12	Rachel	 Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
13	Ross	 So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
14	Chandler	 Or facing a bitch of a commute.
15	Rachel	 I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
16	Ross	 Okay.
17	Rachel	 I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
18	Chandler	 My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
19	Ross	 All right, we'll work it out.
20	Rachel	 Thank you! Thank you!
21	Ross	 Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
22	Rachel	 I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)
23	Phoebe	 Ooh, what's going on?
24	Rachel	 I got a really incredible job offer.
25	Joey	 Hey, great! All right!
26	Phoebe	 Good for you!
27	Rachel	 It's in Paris.
28	Joey	 What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
29	Monica	 Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
30	Joey	 Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
31	Rachel	 Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
32	Phoebe	 Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...
33	Joey	 No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
34	Rachel	 (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...
35	Joey	 Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and Rachel follows him)
36	Rachel	 Joey...
37	Phoebe	 You okay with this?
38	Chandler	 Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
39	Phoebe	 Talking to Ross.
40	Chandler	 I see.
41	Ross	 Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
42	Monica	 I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
43	Ross	 Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
44	Monica	 How is that gonna happen?
45	Chandler	 Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
46	Ross	 I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
47	Monica	 You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
48	Ross	 I didn't say we were brothers.
49		OPENING CREDITS
50	[Scene	 Central Perk. Phoebe's reading a newspaper. Chandler and Monica walk in.]
51	Monica	 Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
52	Chandler	 We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
53	Monica	 But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
54	Chandler	 What do you think Pheebs?
55	Phoebe	 Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
56	Chandler	 Yeah.
57	Phoebe	 She died.
58	Chandler	 You're kidding!
59	Monica	 That's terrible!
60	Phoebe	 Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
61	Chandler	 Oh yeah?
62	Phoebe	 Yeah, she was just an agent.
63	Monica	 Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
64	Chandler	 I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
65	Phoebe	 Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
66	Monica	 Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
67	Phoebe	 Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
68	Monica	 What if he reads it in the paper?
69	Chandler	 Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
70	[Scene	 Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the door and enters.]
71	Ross	 Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
72	Mr Zelner	 Oh right, uhm, Don?
73	Ross	 Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
74	Mr Zelner	 Uh... What can I do for you?
75	Ross	 Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
76	Mr Zelner	 Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
77	Ross	 Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
78	Mr Zelner	 Wow, that is tempting.
79	Ross	 Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it
80	Mr Zelner	 She is good!
81	Ross	 (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.
82	Mr Zelner	 But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
83	Ross	 I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?
84	Mr Zelner	 Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?
85	Ross	 Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
86	Mr Zelner	 Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
87	Ross	 How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
88	Mr Zelner	 You can really arrange that?
89	Ross	 You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.
90	Mr Zelner	 Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.
91	Ross	 Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
92	Mr Zelner	 That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs.
93	Ross	 He’ll be fine.
94	[Scene	 Central Perk. Phoebe’s reading, Joey has just entered the room]
95	Joey	 Hey Phoebe.
96	Phoebe	 Hey. Everything ok?
97	Joey	 I’m just mad at my agent.
98	Phoebe	 Estelle? Why?
99	Joey	 There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.
100	Phoebe	 I’m guessing she does.
101	Joey	 Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
102	Phoebe	 Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
103	Joey	 Ok. Why?
104	Phoebe	 Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
105	Joey	 I love that saying!
106		(Phoebe is outside, taking her cell phone out of her bag and making a call. Joey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing).
107	Joey	 Hello?
108	Phoebe (doing Estelle)	 Joey, it’s Estelle.
109	Joey	 I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.
110	Phoebe-Estelle	 It’s a little coincidental, but believable. (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.
111	Joey	 Yeah, actually I am!
112	Phoebe-Estelle	 I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
113	Joey	 That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
114	Phoebe-Estelle	 Don’t take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
115	Joey	 No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
116	Phoebe-Estelle	 What are you saying?
117	Joey	 I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
118	Phoebe	 Man, tough week for Estelle!
119		
120	[Scene	 Joey’s apartment. Rachel’s there and Ross enters the room with a stuffed dinosaur]
121	Ross	 Hi.
122	Rachel	 Hi.
123	Ross	 Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.
124	Rachel	 Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
125	Ross	 Ok.
126	Rachel	 Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
127	Ross	 Nooo!
128	Rachel	 Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
129	Ross	 So, you’re not going to Paris.
130	Rachel	 No, I’m still going.
131	Ross	 Wh… wh…what?
132	Rachel	 When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
133	Ross	 Yeeeah! (They high-five)
134		
135	[Scene	 house next to the one the Bings are moving into. Chandler and Monica knock, a lady opens the door.]
136	Lady	 Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
137	Monica	 Thanks.
138	Chandler	 It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?
139	Monica	 Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
140	Lady	 So? What do you think?
141	Monica	 Love it!
142	Lady	 Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
143	Monica	 They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
144	Lady	 Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…
145	Janice	 Oh my God!
146		(Chandler and Monica are speechless).
147	Chandler (to Monica)	 Sure.
148	[Scene	 Joey’s apartment. He’s there and Phoebe comes in.]
149	Phoebe	 Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
150	Joey	 Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
151	Phoebe	 No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
152	Joey	 I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
153	Phoebe	 No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)
154	Joey	 Why?
155	Phoebe	 Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
156	Joey	 (impressed) You blow me away.
157	Phoebe	 (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
158	Joey	 I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves)
159		
160	[Scene	 The house Monica and Chandler are viewing. Janice comes down the stairs.]
161	Chandler	 And yet I never run into Beyonce!
162	Realtor	 You two know each other?
163	Janice	 Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, who tries to get away from her)
164	Chandler	 (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
165	Monica	 No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)
166	Chandler	 (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
167	Monica	 (looks confused and scared) I don't know why.
168	Janice	 Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)
169	Chandler	 This can not be happening!
170	Monica	 Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
171	Chandler	 The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
172	Monica	 (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
173	Chandler	 That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
174	Monica	 Okay, you come up with an idea.
175	Chandler	 Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
176	Monica	 But we love our house.
177	Chandler	 Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) "Oh My God"!
178	Monica	 Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)
179	Chandler	 (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
180		
181	[Scene	 Mr. Zellner's office. There is a knock on the door.]
182	r Zelner	 Who is it?
183	Ross	 (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
184	Mr Zelner	 This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
185	Ross	 Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks hopeful)
186	Mr Zelner	 (obviously amused) Not good, Ron.
187	Ross	 Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
188	Mr Zelner	 (Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)
189	Ross	 Huh? So? We have a deal?
190	Mr Zelner	 Okay, you got it.
191	Ross	 Yes! yes!
192	Mr Zelner	 This is gonna make me very popular.
193	Ross	 Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
194	Mr Zelner	 (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son.
195	Ross	 Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs up and leaves)
196		
197	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. He walks in reading his mail, and plays back his messages on the answering machine]
198	Joey	 Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?
199	Phoebe	 (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
200	Joey	 Estelle?
201	Phoebe	 Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
202	Joey	 (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
203	Phoebe	 Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
204	Joey	 No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by, don't drop by!
205	Phoebe	 Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
206	Joey	 Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
207	Phoebe	 (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
208	Joey	 Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
209		
210	[Scene	 The house next door to Chandler and Monica's new house. Chandler is pacing worriedly through the living room when Janice enters.]
211	Chandler	 The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
212	Janice	 All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)
213	Chandler	 Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
214	Janice	 Oh, me too... (laughs)
215	Chandler	 Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
216	Janice	 Huh?
217	Chandler	 I never stopped loving you.
218	Janice	 Oh... my...
219	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
220	Janice	 Chandler, what are you talking about?
221	Chandler	 Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
222	Janice	 I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.
223	Chandler	 (stunned) Obviously.
224	Janice	 But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
225	Chandler	 Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
226	Janice	 Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
227	Chandler	 I understand.
228	Janice	 Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)
229	Chandler	 (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
230		
231	[Scene	 Ross's apartment. Ross is working on his laptop when Rachel enters with Emma.]
232	Rachel	 Hi!
233	Ross	 Hey!
234	Rachel	 You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
235	Ross	 What?
236	Rachel	 Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
237	Ross	 They did?
238	Rachel	 Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
239	Ross	 So, what are you gonna do?
240	Rachel	 Well, I took it.
241	Ross	 That's great! So you're staying in New York!
242	Both	 YAY! WHOO! YAY!
243	Ross	 You're excited, right?
244	Rachel	 (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
245	Ross	 Right!
246	Rachel	 Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
247	Ross	 Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
248	Rachel	 Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
249	Ross	 (after a long pause) You should go.
250	Rachel	 What?
251	Ross	 It's what you want. You should go.
252	Rachel	 You really think so?
253	Ross	 I really do.
254	Rachel	 But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
255	Ross	 (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll understand.
256	Rachel	 All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
257	Ross	 Yeah...
258	Rachel	 Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
259	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)
260	Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
261	Ross	 Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)
262		COMMERCIAL BREAK
263	[Scene	 Estelle's memorial service. Joey is giving a speech. Next to him is a blown op photograph of Estelle behind her desk and there's a man standing next to him.]
264	Joey	 Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph) ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's nothing left in his mouth.)
265		THE END
