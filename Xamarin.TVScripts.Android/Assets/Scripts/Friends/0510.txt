2	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's apartment, Ross is cleaning out the fridge. Joey walks from his room. He looks like he just woke up.]
3	Joey	 What are you doing?
4	Ross	 I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf
5	Joey	 Why are you doing this?
6	Ross	 Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
7	Joey	 Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?
8	Ross	 Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
9	Joey	 Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down. (Ross sits down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
10	Ross	 So what, we just sit?
11	Joey	 Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)
12	Chandler	 (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.
13	Joey	 (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
14	Chandler	 (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!
15	Joey	 But, I love you.
16	Chandler	 Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)
17	Joey	 And that’s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.
18		Opening Credits
19	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are there. Phoebe walks in ringing a bell.]
20	Phoebe	 Hey you guys, guess what?
21	Chandler	 The British are coming?
22	Phoebe	 Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.
23	All	 Ohh.
24	Phoebe	 (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
25	Chandler	 Ohh.
26	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.
27	Monica	 You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. (Chandler laughs.)
28	Joey	 So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
29	Phoebe	 Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.
30	Rachel	 Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.
31	Danny	 Hey guys.
32	All	 Hey Danny.
33	Monica	 Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at, right?
34	Rachel	 Thanks, Mon.
35	Danny	 Well, of course.
36	Monica	 Do you want to go out on a date with her?
37	Rachel	 Monica!!!
38	Danny	 (Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
39	Monica	 Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.
40	Danny	 (To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To Rachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)
41	Rachel	 (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.
42	[Scene	 Estelle's (Joey's Agent) Office, Joey is there.]
43	Joey	 How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
44	Estelle	 Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
45	Joey	 She’s a woman!
46	Estelle	 What can I say? She nailed it.
47	Joey	 (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?
48	Estelle	 Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn.
49	[Scene	 In front of Macys, Phoebe is collecting donations and ringing her bell.]
50	Phoebe	 Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)
51	Monica	 (Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!
52	Phoebe	 Hey!
53	Monica	 I just wanted to see how it's going.
54	Phoebe	 Well, it's going okay.
55	Monica	 (Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out.
56	Phoebe	 Oh, thanks!
57	Monica	 Yeah!
58	Phoebe	 Wow!
59		(Monica puts some change in Phoebe's bucket.)
60	Phoebe	 Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
61	Monica	 Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
62	Phoebe	 Just get your nails done?
63	Monica	 Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)
64	Phoebe	 Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
65		(A man walks up and puts a dollar bill in.)
66	Phoebe	 Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
67		(The man starts to take some change out.)
68	Phoebe	 Wait, you can't take the money out.
69	The Man	 I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
70	Phoebe	 But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
71	The Man	 I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
72	Phoebe	 Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…
73	The Man	 Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)
74	Phoebe	 Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She scowls at him.)
75	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is telling Ross how he didn't get the part.]
76	Joey	 That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
77	Ross	 I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
78	Joey	 Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
79		(Ross just stares at him until he figures it out.)
80	Joey	 Wait a second, I could star in it!
81	Ross	 Or that.
82	Joey	 I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
83	Ross	 I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
84	Joey	 Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
85	Ross	 Yeah!
86	Joey	 Thanks!
87	Ross	 (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
88	Joey	 Done!
89	Ross	 And it can't be Joey.
90	Joey	 It's not.
91	Ross	 Or Joseph.
92	Joey	 (disappointed) Oh.
93	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning. Monica enters from her room wearing nothing but a robe.]
94	Monica	 Hey, what's up?
95	Rachel	 I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
96	Monica	 Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
97	Rachel	 Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
98	Monica	 You had no relationship!!
99	Rachel	 No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
100	Monica	 Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
101	Rachel	 She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
102		(Rachel goes into her room and closes the door. Which allows Monica to let Chandler out of her room.)
103	Monica	 Come on, hurry!
104		(Chandler runs out the door and closes it behind him. After a short pause the door opens and Chandler comes rushing back through, grabs Monica, kisses her good-bye, and heads back out.)
105	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is trying to write his movie, Chandler is playing a game on the counter by trying to flip a ping pong ball with a spoon into a nearby bowl.]
106	Joey	 Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
107	Chandler	 Why?
108	Joey	 Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
109		(Chandler makes it into the bowl.)
110	Chandler	 Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
111	Joey	 You're driving me crazy with that!
112	Chandler	 Okay, I'll stop.
113	Joey	 Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
114		(Chandler slides the bowl to the far end of the counter. He tries again, but he hits the spoon to hard and the ball goes flying away.)
115	Joey	 Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
116	Chandler	 You wanna play?
117	Joey	 Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
118	Chandler	 Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
119	Joey	 (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
120	Chandler	 I'm intrigued.
121	Joey	 All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
122	Chandler	 Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
123	Joey	 Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
124	Chandler	 Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
125	Joey	 Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)
126	[Scene	 In front of Macys, Phoebe is still ringing her bell. A guy puts some change into the bucket.]
127	Phoebe	 Thank you, Happy Holidays.
128		(Another woman walks up and throws something into the bucket.)
129	Phoebe	 Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
130		(Another guy walks by and throws his light cigarette butt in the bucket.)
131	Phoebe	 Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!
132	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is reading what Joey wrote.]
133	Ross	 All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.
134	Joey	 Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
135	Chandler	 (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
136	Ross	 This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
137	Joey	 You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
138	Ross	 (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on!
139	Joey	 Hey!
140		(He tries to fire a burnt tennis ball into the bowl Chandler is standing by, but Ross grabs the ball away from him.)
141	Ross	 No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
142	[Scene	 Outside Danny's apartment, Danny and Rachel are returning from their date.]
143	Danny	 I had a really nice time tonight.
144	Rachel	 So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
145		(He kisses her.)
146	Danny	 I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
147	Rachel	 You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods, "Yes.") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
148	Danny's Sister	 (opening the door) Oh, I thought I heard you.
149	Danny	 Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
150	Rachel	 Hi!
151	Krista	 Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
152	Danny	 Like it would help.
153	Krista	 You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)
154	Danny	 You are! (Hits her back.)
155	Krista	 You are! (Hits him softly.)
156	Danny	 You are! (Hits her back.)
157	Krista	 You are! (Hits him softly.)
158	Danny	 You are! (Hits her back.)
159	Krista	 You are! (Hits him harder this time.)
160	Danny	 You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
161		(He starts chasing her around Rachel a couple of times before she runs into the living room and he tackles her on the couch where he starts tickling her.)
162	Rachel	 (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue to ignore her.)
163		Commercial Break
164	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is complaining to Ross and Monica about the bucket.]
165	Phoebe	 Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
166	Monica	 No.
167	Phoebe	 Does it look like an ashtray?
168	Monica	 No.
169	Phoebe	 Does it look like a urinal?
170	Monica	 Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
171	Ross	 So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
172	Phoebe	 Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
173	Monica	 Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
174	Phoebe	 Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
175	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Hey!
176	Monica	 Hey!
177	Rachel	 Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
178	Monica and Ross	 Sure.
179	Rachel	 Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
180	Ross	 Oh-oh, yeah.
181	Monica	 All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
182	Ross	 Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
183	Monica	 Still, I was quick as a cat.
184	Rachel	 Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
185	Monica	 Oh, you're kidding.
186	Rachel	 Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
187	Monica	 (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.
188	Ross	 Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
189	Monica	 Too strong for me?
190	Ross	 Yeah.
191	Monica	 You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
192	Ross	 Oh fine.
193	Monica	 Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.)
194	Rachel	 Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. (She leaves them to wrestle.)
195	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is cleaning the foosball table, Joey is working on his script.]
196	Chandler	 (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
197	Ross	 Joey's not going.
198	Joey	 (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.
199	Chandler	 Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
200	Ross	 Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
201	Joey	 Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
202	Chandler	 (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
203	Ross	 I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
204	Joey	 Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
205	Chandler	 The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
206	Ross	 I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
207	Joey	 Come on look guys, don't fight.
208	Ross	 And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
209	Chandler	 Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
210	Ross	 If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
211	Joey	 Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
212	Ross	 How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
213	Chandler	 I paid for those tickets!
214	Ross	 No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
215	Chandler	 Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
216	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are listening to a story being told by Danny and his sister.]
217	Danny	 …so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His sister) forgets the camera!
218	Joey	 Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
219	Chandler	 When did that happen to you?!
220	Joey	 Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!
221	Chandler	 Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
222	Krista	 Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it and some filling falls into his lap.)
223	Danny	 Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
224	Krista	 Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)
225	Krista	 We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
226	Danny	 Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
227	Rachel	 Oh, great!
228	Chandler	 Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
229	Monica	 That was unbelievable!
230	Rachel	 Okay, see? I told you!
231	Joey	 Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
232	Chandler	 I don't believe they're brother and sister.
233	Joey	 They're brother and sister!!!
234	[Scene	 In front of Macys, Phoebe has adorned her bucket with numerous signs. Like "We are not a urinal!" and "I have no Macys info." And other stuff like that. She also has a scowl on her face as she is ringing her bell. A little old lady walks up to make a donation but Phoebe stops her.]
235	Phoebe	 Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. (The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
236		(Another man walks up with a drink in his hand, Phoebe stops him too.)
237	Phoebe	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought I told you to get outta here!
238	Bob	 Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
239	Phoebe	 What?!
240	Bob	 Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
241	Phoebe	 That chick can't handle my corner.
242	Bob	 Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
243	Phoebe	 Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)
244	[Scene	 Danny's apartment, there's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
245	Danny	 Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
246	Rachel	 Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
247	Danny	 What?! Why?!
248	Rachel	 Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…
249	Danny	 Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
250	Rachel	 Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…
251	Danny	 Do-do you, do you have brothers?
252	Rachel	 No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
253	Danny	 Are you close with them?
254	Rachel	 No-no, they're not very nice people.
255	Danny	 Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
256	Rachel	 Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…
257	Krista	 (calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
258	Danny	 (seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?
259	Rachel	 Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)
260	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is there as Chandler enters.]
261	Chandler	 Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
262	Ross	 Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
263	Joey	 (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
264	Ross	 Yay!
265	Chandler	 Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
266	Joey	 No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
267	Ross	 I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
268	Chandler	 Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
269	Joey	 Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
270	Chandler	 All right. (Takes a copy.)
271	Ross	 All right. (Takes another copy.)
272	Joey	 Okay. (Reading.) "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)
273		(Ross and Chandler start to read Joey's script aloud.)
274	Ross	 Hey man.
275	Chandler	 What is up?
276	Ross	 About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
277	Chandler	 No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
278	Ross	 Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
279	Chandler	 Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
280	Ross	 I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.
281	Chandler	 (To Ross) I'm sorry too.
282	Joey	 Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
283	Ross	 (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.
284	Chandler	 I am sorry, Ross.
285	Joey	 A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well you co-created Fireball. The end.
286	Chandler	 This took you all day?!
287	Joey	 No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!
