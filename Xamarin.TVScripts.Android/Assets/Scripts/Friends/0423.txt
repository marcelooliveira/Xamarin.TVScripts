4	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to London and Monica comes running in.]
5	Monica	 Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)
6	Chandler	 Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
7	Joey	 What do you got there?
8	Chandler	 Condoms, dude!
9	Joey (looks at the box)	 How come the writing is in Spanish?
10	Chandler	 Don't read my condoms!
11		[Cut to the girls' apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe and Rachel watch.]
12	Monica	 Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
13	Rachel	 Who are you saying "check" too?
14	Monica	 Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
15	Phoebe	 Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
16	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
17	Monica	 Hey!
18	Ross	 Hey! Are you ready yet?
19	Monica	 Yep! You got the tickets?
20	Ross	 Oh! Got 'em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!
21		[Cut to the guys' apartment.]
22	Joey	 It's all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls' apartment.)
23	Chandler	 You got your passport?
24	Joey	 Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
25		(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesn't know why, it takes him a little bit to figure it out.)
26	Joey	 Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)
27	Chandler	 There it is.
28		Opening Credits
29	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where everything is.]
30	Monica	 Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
31	Phoebe	 Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
32	Monica	 Yeah, okay, give that a try!
33	Chandler	 (entering, with Joey) All right! Let's do it!
34	Joey	 Woo-hoo!!
35	Ross	 Yeah, cheerie-o!
36	Joey	 London baby!
37	Chandler	 Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
38	Joey	 (louder) London baby!!
39	Chandler	 Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
40	Ross	 Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
41	Phoebe	 Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
42	Ross	 Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
43	Phoebe	 Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
44	Ross	 Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
45	Phoebe	 Oh, have a great wedding!
46	Ross	 Thanks.
47	Phoebe	 Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
48	Chandler	 Hey! (Trots over)
49	Phoebe	 Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
50	Chandler	 Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's book as Rachel comes in from her room.)
51	Ross	 (to Rachel) So, we're off.
52	Rachel	 Have fun!
53	Ross	 Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
54	Rachel	 Oh, I know.
55	Ross	 So-so come! Why don't you come?
56	Rachel	 What?!
57	Ross	 To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
58	Rachel	 Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
59	Ross	 Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
60	Rachel	 Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
61	Ross	 This is my wedding.
62	Monica	 All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
63	Ross	 Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
64	Chandler	 (entering, with Phoebe's book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
65	Phoebe	 (laughs) Thank you.
66		(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.
67	Phoebe	 Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)
68	Ross	 All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
69	Joey	 Bye, Pheebs!
70		(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says "bye." In the hall, Joey says...)
71	Joey	 London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
72	Phoebe	 Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
73		(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show moves it's entire production to an entirely different country to make a single episode. We get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the London Marriott as Joey and Chandler exit.)
74	[Scene	 Street in front of the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]
75	Joey	 Come on! Do something!
76	Chandler	 I am, I'm ignoring you.
77	Joey	 Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
78	Chandler	 Oh, what the hell is that?
79	Joey	 It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I'm gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)
80	Chandler	 Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
81	Joey	 I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.
82	Chandler	 Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
83	Joey	 Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)
84	[Scene	 Another street, somewhere along the River Thames, Ross, Emily, and Monica are walking to where they're gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the caterer.]
85	Emily	 ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
86	Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?
87	Emily	 Well, up yours too!
88	Ross	 What?!
89	Emily	 Oh, that's not what it means?
90	Ross	 No! No! That's-that's time-out!
91	Emily	 Sorry.
92	Ross	 Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
93	Monica	 Chicken Kiev?
94	Ross	 Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
95	Monica	 Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
96	Ross	 Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
97	Emily	 I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... (She stops suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!
98	Monica	 It's nice.
99	Emily	 Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)
100		[Cut to inside.]
101	Emily	 (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
102	Ross	 It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
103	Emily	 How's it gonna be all right?!
104	Ross	 Uh-huh, I see that.
105	Monica	 (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
106	Ross	 What? What?
107	Monica	 They tore it down a few days early.
108	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey are sitting on the top floor on one of the red coaches in London that doesn't have a roof. Joey is very enthusiastic and is pointing at all the different sights. Chandler is really embarrassed and tries to make him stop. Afterwards, Joey tries to film Chandler with his video camera, and Chandler obviously hates this. Then, Joey falls asleep, and Chandler tries to take the video camera away from him. However, Joey is holding onto it (in his sleep) and won't let it go. Chandler pulls until Joey lets it go, causing Chandler to fall out of his seat.]
109	[Scene	 Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of London and are approaching the Abbey.]
110	Joey	 All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
111	Chandler	 I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
112	Joey	 Really? To what?
113	Chandler	 To Put the Camera Away!!!
114	Joey	 Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)
115	[Scene	 A bridal shop somewhere in London. Monica is trying on her red bridesmaid dress, and Emily is watching. A dressmaker is working on Monica's dress.]
116	Monica	 Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
117		(The dressmaker puts a pin in the dress, but accidentally pricks Monica with it.)
118	Monica	 Oowww!!
119	Dressmaker	 Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
120	Emily	 We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
121	Monica	 You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
122	Emily	 I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
123	Monica	 But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
124		(Emily smiles a bit and looks uncomfortable.)
125	Monica	 Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
126	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel enters.]
127	Phoebe	 Oh. Oh.
128	Rachel	 Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
129	Phoebe	 Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
130	Rachel	 Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
131	Phoebe	 Okay, I have a wedgie.
132	Rachel	 Okay, that is all you.
133	Phoebe	 So-so, what do you want for lunch?
134	Rachel	 Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
135	Phoebe	 Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
136	Rachel	 I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
137	Phoebe	 Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
138	Rachel	 (interrupting) Still in love with?!
139	Phoebe	 Yeah!
140	Rachel	 I'm not in love with Ross!
141	Phoebe	 Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
142	Rachel	 Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
143	Phoebe	 We thought you knew!
144	Rachel	 We?!
145	Phoebe	 Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
146	Rachel	 You all know? Does Ross know?
147	Phoebe	 Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
148	Rachel	 Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
149	Phoebe	 Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
150		(Rachel stares at her.)
151	Rachel	 What?!
152	Phoebe	 Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
153	[Scene	 A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]
154	Joey	 Hey!
155	The Vendor	 So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
156	Joey	 Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
157	Chandler	 Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
158	Joey	 Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)
159	Chandler	 All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
160	Joey	 Oh, I embarrass you?
161	Chandler	 How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
162	The Vendor	 He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
163	Chandler	 Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
164	The Vendor	 (looks around) They're all tourists.
165	Chandler	 All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
166	Joey	 Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
167	The Vendor	 Good choice.
168	Joey	 Thanks.
169	Chandler	 Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
170		(A man walks up to Joey and stares at Chandler and the flower stand. Joey turns around to introduce himself.)
171	Joey	 How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
172		(Joey shakes his hand. The man looks at him and his hat.)
173	[Scene	 The hotel, Ross's room, Emily is entering.]
174	Emily	 Hello?
175	Ross	 Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
176	Emily	 We don't have to.
177	Ross	 Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
178	Emily	 No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
179	Ross	 She said what?
180	Emily	 She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
181	Ross	 Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn't right.
182	Emily	 I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
183	Ross	 I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)
184	Emily	 Don't you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
185	Ross	 The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
186	Emily	 So what are you saying? It's now or never?
187	Ross	 No. I'm saying it's now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)
188	Emily	 Or?
189	Ross	 There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
190	Emily	 It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! (She storms out.)
191	Ross	 (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
192		Commercial Break
193	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the couch as Rachel returns carrying a bunch of shopping bags.]
194	Phoebe	 Hey!
195	Rachel	 (depressed) Hi.
196	Phoebe	 So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
197	Rachel	 Manhattan does not have enough stores.
198	Phoebe	 Well, I think I can help you get over him.
199	Rachel	 You can?
200	Phoebe	 Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
201	Rachel	 Um-hmm.
202	Phoebe	 And a small piece of chocolate.
203	Rachel	 Okay.
204	Phoebe	 And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
205	Rachel	 Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
206	Phoebe	 Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
207	Rachel	 I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
208	Phoebe	 Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
209	Rachel	 I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
210	Phoebe	 Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
211	Rachel	 Okay.
212	Phoebe	 Okay?
213	Rachel	 All right.
214	Phoebe	 So uh, now look at the picture...
215	Rachel	 Okay.
216	Phoebe	 All right, and umm... (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.)
217	Rachel	 Ow!
218	Phoebe	 Okay, how do you feel now?
219	Rachel	 Well, I like you less!
220	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's hotel room. Chandler is trying to kick his shoe into a trash can that is standing on the TV. He can't do it.]
221	Chandler	 Well, this is just as boring in England.
222		(Joey returns, still wearing his hat.)
223	Joey	 Hey.
224	Chandler	 Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
225	Joey	 Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!
226	Chandler	 No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
227	Joey	 Me too.
228	Chandler	 Yeah?
229	Joey	 Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
230	Monica	 (entering) Hey!
231	Joey	 Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
232		[Cut to the tape Joey made in front of some famous place in London with a rather famous English-type person.]
233	Joey	 (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
234	Fergie	 (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
235	Joey	 (on tape) Oh, Chandler.
236	Fergie	 Hi Chandler! (Waves)
237	Chandler	 That's... That's was...
238	Monica	 Oh my God!
239	Joey	 That's Fergie baby!!
240	Fergie	 Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
241	Joey	 (on tape) So, I hear you're single now...
242	Fergie	 Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much. (She smiles.)
243	Chandler	 How did you? How? How?
244	Joey	 Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and...(Ross enters) Hey!
245	Monica	 Hey!
246	Ross	 Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
247	Monica	 (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
248	Ross	 Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
249	Monica	 Umm...
250	Chandler	 I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
251	Joey	 Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)
252	Ross	 Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
253	Monica	 She said that?!
254	Ross	 Yeah.
255	Monica	 Why?!
256	Ross	 I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
257	Monica	 Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
258	Ross	 Excuse me?
259	Monica	 Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
260	Ross	 I don't know. A month?
261	Monica	 Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
262	Ross	 I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
263	Monica	 Sometimes we were.
264	Ross	 Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
265	Monica	 Okay.
266	Ross	 Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
267	Chandler	 That was pretty intense huh?
268	Joey	 Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
269	Chandler	 (glares at him) I hope he did!
270	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is on the couch, and Rachel is sitting on the chair.]
271	Phoebe	 Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
272	Rachel	 Oh, right! (BEAT) Wait a minute, I do that too.
273	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
274		(The phone rings.)
275	Phoebe	 I'll get it.
276		(She answers it.)
277	Phoebe	 Hello.
278	Joey	 (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
279	Phoebe	 Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
280	Joey	 That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
281	Phoebe	 Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
282	Joey	 Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
283	Phoebe	 So you're not homesick yet?
284	Joey	 No, I don't think so.
285	Phoebe	 All right, the seven of us miss you.
286	Joey	 Who's seven?
287	Phoebe	 Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
288	Joey	 Ahh, the babies miss me?
289	Phoebe	 Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
290		(There is a knock on Rachel and Phoebe's door.)
291	Phoebe	 Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
292	Joey	 What? You ordered pizza without me?!
293	Phoebe	 Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
294	Joey	 Two pizzas?!
295	Phoebe	 Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
296	Joey	 Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
297		(Phoebe has already hung up, leaving Joey in the dark. So Joey decides to watch some TV and turns on a rerun of Cheers, with the theme song playing. At first, he's happy, but as the song progresses Joey gets depressed and homesick.)
298	[Scene	 Ross and Emily's planned wedding place, Monica is dragging Emily in.]
299	Emily	 Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
300	Monica	 You'll see.
301	Emily	 I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
302		(At that Ross plugs in some Christmas lights to light the place up.)
303	Emily	 Oh God.
304	Ross	 Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
305	Monica	 And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and... (Points to Ross) You go.
306	Ross	 But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
307	Emily	 It's perfect.
308	Ross	 And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
309	Emily	 Well then we'll get wet. (They kiss.)
310	Monica	 Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
311	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is in her bedroom.]
312	Rachel	 Pheebs?
313	Phoebe	 Yeah?
314	Rachel	 Do you remember where the duck food is?
315	Phoebe	 Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
316	Rachel	 (enters with a bag packed) Because I'm going to London.
317	Phoebe	 What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
318	Rachel	 Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)
319	Phoebe	 But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
320	Rachel	 Yeah, that didn't work.
321	Phoebe	 I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
322	Rachel	 Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
323	Phoebe	 That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
324	Rachel	 Ohh-Do you think he will?!
325	Phoebe	 No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
326	Rachel	 Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do." (Exits)
327	Phoebe	 I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn't stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.

330	Housekeeper	 The Waltham Residence.
331	Phoebe	 Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
332	Housekeeper	 This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
333	Phoebe	 What are you saying?!
334	Housekeeper	 Now, let us try that again, shall we?
335		(The housekeeper hangs up.)
336	Phoebe	 (Shocked) No! Ooh! Oh my god! (Dials again.)
337	Housekeeper	 The Waltham Residence.
338	Phoebe	 (In a British accent) Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
339	Housekeeper	 Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
340	Phoebe	 No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
341	Housekeeper	 I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
342	Phoebe	 Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
343	Housekeeper	 Hangs up.
344	Phoebe	 Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.

360	Mr. Waltham	 Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding. (He hands a multipage bill to Jack.)
361	Mr. Geller	 Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
362	Mrs. Geller	 We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw (patting Monica on the shoulder.).
363	Monica	 Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
364		(Ross quickly directs the families to their tables.)

369	Joey	 (Looking up at the waiter)That's not food...No, I don't, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
370	Chandler	 Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
371	Joey	 (Pointing at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)

378	Ross	 (Holding him back.)Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the bill.) Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
379	Mr. Geller	 And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
380	Mrs. Geller	 Ooh, Jack....(He looks over to her) Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be. (They embrace and kiss passionately.)
381	Monica	 (Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And I'm going to go get drunk. (Gets up to get a drink.)
382	[Scene	 John F. Kennedy International Airport, Rachel is running to the ticket counter.]

398	Ticket Agent	 I'm just going to need to see your passport.
399	Rachel	 (Looking through her purse.) Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it across the counter.)
400	Ticket Agent	 (Slides the twenty back and tosses her credit card onto the counter.)
401	[Scene	 The Rehearsal dinner hall. Ross is at the Walthams' table discussing the bill.]
402	Ross	 Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
403	Mr. Waltham	 Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
404	Ross	 I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
405	Mrs. Waltham	 This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. (Ross looks frustrated. She begins to scream at her husband.) Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
406	Mr. Waltham	 Don't take that tone with me. (She looks evilly at him.) All-all right you can. (He looks over at Ross and Shrugs.)

409	Phoebe	 (Looking relieved. She puts down the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
410	Rachel	 (Running back out the door with her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.

413	Chandler	 I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)
414	Mrs. Waltham	 Hello, Waltham Interiors.
415	Phoebe	 Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
416	Mrs. Waltham	 Who is this?
417	Phoebe	 Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
418	Mrs. Waltham	 Where did you get this number?
419	Phoebe	 I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
420	Mrs. Waltham	 Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
421	Phoebe	 Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
422	Mrs. Waltham	 Oh, am I on the radio?
423	Phoebe	 No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
424	Mrs. Waltham	 No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off. (She hangs up.)
425	Phoebe	 Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
426	Chandler	 (Continuing his toast.) And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily. (He sits down.)
427	Joey	 Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?
428		(One of the bridesmaids, Felicity, puts her arm around Joey.)
429	Felicity	 (Putting her arm around Joey.) Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
430	Joey	 (Putting his arm around her.) I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
431	[Scene	 Later that evening at the rehearsal dinner. Chandler and Monica are sitting on a sofa. Chandler is covering his face in embarrassment because of the toast.]
432	Monica	 I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)
433	Chandler	 Out loud?
434	Monica	 Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
435	Chandler	 So how are you doing?
436	Monica	 My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
437	Drunk Man	 I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
438	Monica	 Well, thanks, we like him.
439	Drunk Man	 My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him. (Monica stares straight forward after the comment. Chandler tries to console her by patting her on the shoulder.)
440		(Ross and Emily's parents are seated at a table. Ross is between them and they are discussing the wedding bill.)
441	Mr. Geller	 There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
442	Ross	 Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
443	Mr. Geller	 All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man. (Emily's stepmum looks shocked. Jack and Judy get up and leave.)
444		(Chandler's trying to console Monica.)
445	Chandler	 The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
446	Monica	 Then why would he say it?
447	Chandler	 Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
448	Monica	 Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
449	Chandler	 Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
450	Monica	 Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
451	[Scene	 The airport. Rachel runs up to the ticket counter.]
452	Rachel	 Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
453	Ticket Agent	 Hello.
454	Rachel	 Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
455	Ticket Agent	 Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
456	Rachel	 Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
457	Ticket Agent	 I can't do that.
458	Rachel	 Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
459	Ticket Agent	 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
460	Rachel	 Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
461	Ticket Agent	 I can't imagine why.
462	Rachel	 All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)

498	Joey	 Okay.
499	Phoebe	 All right, so, okay...
500	Joey	 Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.
501	Phoebe	 Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?

510	Passenger	 But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
511	Rachel	 (Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.
512	Passenger	 Oh-no.(He bites his fist at her.)
513	Rachel	 Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!

579	Phoebe	 Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
580	Joey	 Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
581	Phoebe	 No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds the phone above Ross's shoulder.)
582		(Chandler escorts Monica down the aisle.)
583	Chandler	 What we did last night was....
584	Monica	 Stupid.
585	Chandler	 Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
586	Monica	 What were we thinking?
587	Chandler	 I'm coming over tonight though, right?
588	Monica	 Oh yeah. Definitely.
589		(They quickly take their places and Here Comes the Bride begins to play. Everyone seated looks back. Emily is being escorted up the aisle by her father. She kisses him on the cheek and takes her place by Ross's side.)
590	Minister	 Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
591	Emily	 I, Emily...
592	Minister	 Take thee Ross...
593	Emily	 Take thee Ross...
594	Minister	 As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
595	Emily	 As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
596	Minister	 Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
597	Ross	 I Ross...
598	Minister	 Take thee, Emily...
599	Ross	 Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realises what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
600		(Rachel looks all around as if all the eyes in the chapel were looking at her.)
601	Rachel	 (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
602	Minister	 (Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I go on?
603	{Transcriber's Note	 This is orginally where the season four cliffhanger was. So you all have to wait four months before reading on.}
604	Emily	 Yes, yes, do go on.
605		(Cut to the parents.)
606	Mr. Geller	 (to Mr. Waltham) He better go on for what I'm paying.
607	Mr. Waltham	 After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
608	Minister	 I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
609	Ross	 I, Ross...
610	Minister	 Take thee, EM-I-LY...
611	Ross	 Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like there'd be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)
612	Minister	 As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
613		(Cut to the Walthams.)
614	Mrs. Waltham	 (to Mr. Waltham) Looks like that might come any minute.
615	Ross	 As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)
616	Minister	 May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his finger) Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
617	Ross	 Happy to.
618	Minister	 Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
619	Ross	 Yay!
620	Minister	 You may kiss the bride.
621		(He goes to kiss her, but she isn't very receptive of the kiss. She keeps avoiding him, until Ross finally gets to kiss her on her cheek.)
622	Mrs. Geller	 (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
623		(The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily's hand, but she snatches it away from him.)
624	Emily	 Just keep smiling.
625	Ross	 Okay.
626	Joey	 Well, that went well. Yeah.
627	Chandler	 It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
628		(Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.)
629	Ross	 (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
630		(Emily gives him a forearm shot across the stomach.)
631		Commercial Break
632	[Scene	 The Wedding reception, Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are standing outside the doorway.]
633	Emily	 (Yelling from inside the bathroom) You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
634	Joey	 (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
635	Ross	 (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She's just fixing her makeup.
636	Emily	 I hate you!!
637	Ross	 And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)
638	Mr. Geller	 Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
639	Ross	 That's true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)
640		(Mrs. Waltham's phone rings and she answers it.)
641	Mrs. Waltham	 Yes, Waltham interiors.
642	Phoebe	 (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
643	Mrs. Waltham	 Who?
644	Phoebe	 Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
645	Mrs. Waltham	 Oh my God, Phoebe.
646	Phoebe	 No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
647		(Mrs. Waltham hangs up on her.)
648	Phoebe	 Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
649		(Cut to Chandler and Monica at the buffet table.)
650	Chandler	 Hey.
651	Monica	 Hey.
652	Chandler	 Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
653	Monica	 I know. How could we have let this happen?
654	Chandler	 Seven times!
655	Monica	 Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
656	Chandler	 In a foreign, romantic country...
657	Monica	 I blame London.
658	Chandler	 Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
659	Monica	 So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
660	Chandler	 Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
661	Monica	 Only here.
662	Chandler	 Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
663	Monica	 I'll meet you there in two minutes.
664	Chandler	 Okay!
665		(He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, Monica is about to follow him but is intercepted by Rachel.)
666	Rachel	 Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
667	Monica	 (impatiently) Now?
668	Rachel	 Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
669	Monica	 Oh, I-I don't know.
670	Rachel	 Monica, what should I do?
671	Monica	 Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)
672	Rachel	 What?
673	Monica	 Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)
674	Rachel	 Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
675	Monica	 Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
676	Rachel	 Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
677		(Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.)
678	Mrs. Geller	 Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
679	Mr. Waltham	 (walking by) Yes.
680	Mr. Geller	 Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
681	Joey	 Hey, what's up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he's eating it with his hands.)
682	Joey	 (motions to himself and Mrs. Geller and grins) You and me, next dance?
683		(Cut to Rachel who is walking past Mrs. Waltham.)
684	Mrs. Waltham	 Sweetheart, sweetheart...
685	Rachel	 Yes?
686	Mrs. Waltham	 You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
687	Rachel	 Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left. (Points at the entrance.)
688	Mrs. Waltham	 Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
689	Rachel	 Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
690	Mrs. Waltham	 Red Barbra?
691	Rachel	 Yeah. (Smiles uneasily.)
692		(Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.)
693	Monica	 Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
694	Chandler	 Forget it, that's off.
695	Monica	 Why?!
696	Mr. Waltham	 (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
697		(Joey walks up to them.)
698	Monica	 Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
699	Joey	 Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
700	Monica	 That's true.
701	Chandler	 The man's got a point.
702		(Cut to Rachel and Ross.)
703	Rachel	 Oh, hi!
704	Ross	 Hi!
705	Rachel	 Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
706	Ross	 Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
707	Rachel	 Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
708	Ross	 No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
709	Rachel	 Right...
710	Ross	 But it absolutely didn't. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn't!! It didn't!!
711	Joey	 (approaching) Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
712	Ross	 (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
713	Joey	 You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)
714	Ross	 Look, I'm sorry.
715	Joey	 Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
716	Rachel	 (laughs) Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
717	Ross	 Oh, right!
718	Rachel	 Get the hell out of there, y'know?
719		(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realise what she just said and run over to the bathroom.)
720	Ross	 (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)
721	Rachel	 Well, look at that, same thing.
722	[Scene	 London Marriott, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.]
723	Chandler	 Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
724		(She laughs and opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on the bed.)
725	Monica	 Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
726	Chandler	 Oh, hello Rachel.
727	Rachel	 Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
728	Monica	 How did you get in here?
729	Rachel	 If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
730	Chandler	 (to Monica) Your sister Joan is crazy.
731	Rachel	 (They both just stare at her.)Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
732	Chandler	 Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
733	Monica	 Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
734	Chandler	 Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
735	Monica	 (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
736	Rachel	 Okay.
737		(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)
738	Rachel	 Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It's Phoebe!
739	Chandler	 Oh, yay...
740	Monica	 Great...
741	Rachel	 Hi!
742	Phoebe	 Hi, so what happened?
743	Rachel	 Well, Ross said my name.
744	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
745	Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
746	Chandler	 (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
747	Monica	 But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)
748		(Cut to Chandler's room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after seeing that he isn't, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)
749	Chandler	 Wow, you look...
750	Monica	 No time for that!
751		(They both start to frantically rip each other's clothes off, but are interrupted when Joey tries to open the door.)
752	Joey	 Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
753	Chandler	 Well, I've got a girl in here.
754	Joey	 No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
755	Chandler	 Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
756	Joey	 Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
757	Chandler	 Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
758	Monica	 Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
759	Joey	 My Giant? I love that movie!
760	[Scene	 Ross and Emily's room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place to do the deed.]
761	Monica	 You really think this is okay?
762	Chandler	 Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
763	Monica	 Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
764	Chandler	 Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
765	Monica	 Okay!
766	Chandler	 Okay!
767		(They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)
768	Ross	 (entering) Emily?!
769	Chandler	 Nope, not under here!
770	Monica	 You didn't find her?
771	Ross	 No, I've looked everywhere!
772	Chandler	 Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
773	Monica	 Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
774	Chandler	 Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
775	Monica	 Or 45.
776	Chandler	 Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
777	Ross	 No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.
778	Monica	 Well, it's getting late.
779	Chandler	 Yeah, we're gonna go.
780	Ross	 Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
781	Monica	 Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
782	Chandler	 Yeah, it's a very large plane.
783	Ross	 (disappointed) That's cool.
784	Chandler	 But, we'll stay here with you.
785	Ross	 Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
786		(Chandler slowly takes his hand away.)
787		Commercial Break
788	[Scene	 Ross and Emily's room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his head in Monica's lap and his feet on Chandler's lap. Monica and Chandler are both still awake and depressed.]
789	Chandler	 We have to leave for New York in an hour.
790	Monica	 I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
791	Chandler	 We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
792		(They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there's a knock on the door that awakens him.)
793	Ross	 Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
794	Mr. Waltham	 No.
795	Mrs. Waltham	 You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
796	Mr. Waltham	 We've come for her things.
797	Ross	 Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
798	Mr. Waltham	 She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
799	Mrs. Waltham	 We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
800	Mr. Waltham	 Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
801	Mrs. Waltham	 Oh yes, there you are.
802	Rachel	 (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside... (Sees the Walthams and stops.)
803	Mr. Waltham	 Goodbye Geller.
804	Ross	 Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
805	Mr. Waltham	 All right, I'll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!
806	Mrs. Waltham	 (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.
807	Mr. Waltham	 You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
808		
809	[Scene	 A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in first class, depressed.]
810	Monica	 Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
811	Chandler	 Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realises something) Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
812	Monica	 I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
813	Chandler	 'Kay!
814		(Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is startled to see Joey sitting in Monica's seat.)
815	Joey	 Can I ask you something?
816	Chandler	 Uhh, no.
817	Joey	 Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
818	Chandler	 No.
819	Joey	 I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
820	Chandler	 Yes.
821	Joey	 Thanks man.
822	Chandler	 Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
823	Joey	 But what about how much taller he is than me?
824		(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.)
825	Joey	 I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
826		(Monica returns.)
827	Joey	 Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
828	Monica	 I know!
829	Joey	 Had the beef-tips, huh?
830

835	Rachel	 Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
836	Ross	 Oh.
837	Rachel	 Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
838	Ross	 Not yet.
839	Rachel	 So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
840	Gate Agent	 (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
841	Ross	 Pretty soon I guess.
842	Rachel	 Yeah. I'm sorry.
843	Ross	 I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
844	Rachel	 No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
845	Ross	 Same difference.
846	Gate Agent	 (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
847	Ross	 I get it! Well, that's that.
848	Rachel	 No, you know what, I think you should go.
849	Ross	 What?
850	Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
851	Ross	 Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
852	Rachel	 Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
853	Ross	 I could, yeah, I can do that.
854	Rachel	 Yeah.
855	Ross	 I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
856	Rachel	 Good!
857	Ross	 I know, why not?
858	Rachel	 Right!
859	Ross	 Right?
860	Rachel	 Right!
861	Ross	 Y'know-thanks! (They hug)
862	Rachel	 Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
863	Ross	 Yeah, well...nah.
864	Rachel	 What? Wait, what?
865	Ross	 Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
866	Rachel	 Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
867	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
868	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
869	Ross	 No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
870	Rachel	 Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
871	Ross	 Okay!
872	Rachel	 Okay!
873	Ross	 Cool!

876	Rachel	 Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
877	Ross	 Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
878	Rachel	 Oh, wait-wait-wait...

880	Rachel	 Okay. Wait! Wait!
881		(Ross retrieves his jacket and sees that not only has Emily arrived, but she as seen Rachel take her place on the plane.)
882	Ross	 Emily.
883		(She stares at him and Ross realises what she's thinking.)
884	Ross	 Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No! Emily!

891	Rachel	 All right. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. (Realises that that's not how it works.) Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! (yells after the air hostess) Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!

903	Phoebe	 Oh, me too!
904	Joey	 Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
905	Phoebe	 Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
906		(She grabs her bag and leaves, Joey moves a little quicker to his apartment, leaving Monica and Chandler alone.)
907	Monica	 Well, we certainly are alone.
908	Chandler	 Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
909	Monica	 Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
910	Chandler	 Right.
911	Monica	 Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
912	Chandler	 Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
913	Monica	 (laughs) That's okay.
914	Chandler	 And I'm cute too.
915	Monica	 And you're cute too.
916	Chandler	 Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.
917	Monica	 Okay.
918	Chandler	 Bye.
919		(After he closes the door, Monica starts to follow him, but thinks better of it and stops.)
920	Chandler	 (entering) I'm still on London time, does that count?
921	Monica	 That counts!
922	Chandler	 Oh, good! (They start kissing.)
923		End
