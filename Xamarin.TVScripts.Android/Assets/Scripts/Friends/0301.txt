6		Opening Credits
7	[Scene	 Rachel and Monica's, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
8	Ross	 I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
9	Rachel	 Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
10	Phoebe	 See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
11	Rachel	 What song was that, Pheebs?
12	Phoebe	 (singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
13		(Monica enters from her bedroom)
14	Phoebe	 Hi Monica!
15	Ross	 Hey Mon!
16	Rachel	 Hey Mon!
17		(she just walks straight into the bathroom)
18	Phoebe	 Oh my God, has she slept at all?
19	Ross	 Nope.
20	Rachel	 No, it's been three nights in a row.
21	Ross	 Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
22	Phoebe	 Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
23	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is coming in from the bedroom]
24	Chandler	 Morning.
25	Joey	 Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
26	Chandler	 Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
27	Janice	 (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.
28	Joey	 (sarcastically) Good morning.
29	Chandler	 Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
30	Janice	 Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
31	Chandler	 I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
32	Janice	 (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
33	Chandler	 Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
34	Joey	 (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
35	Janice	 I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
36	Joey	 B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
37	Chandler	 Nope, not this time.
38	Joey	 Come on, quite yankin' me.
39	Chandler	 I'm not yanking you.
40	Joey	 This is Janice.
41	Chandler	 Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
42	Joey	 Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
43	Chandler	 (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
44	[Scene	 Rachel and Monica's, Monica is entering from the bathroom.]
45	Monica	 God, look what I found in the drain.
46	Rachel	 What?!
47	Monica	 It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with this?
48	Ross	 Getting it away from me would be job one.
49	Monica	 It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
50	Phoebe	 Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)
51	Monica	 God, what is wrong with me.
52	Ross	 You need to get some sleep.
53	Monica	 I need to get some Richard.
54	Rachel	 Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
55	Monica	 I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
56	Phoebe	 Maybe, because you told him not to.
57	Monica	 What are you the memory woman?
58	Joey	 (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
59	Rachel	 Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
60	Joey	 Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
61	Rachel	 Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
62	Joey	 There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
63	Ross	 Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
64	Joey	 Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
65	[Scene	 Ross's bedroom, Ross is working and Rachel is reading a book in bed]
66	Rachel	 (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....
67	Ross	 Hmm?
68	Rachel	 Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
69	Ross	 Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
70	Rachel	 Hmm.
71	Ross	 I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
72	Rachel	 You remember not having sex in high school, right?
73	Ross	 Yeah.
74	Rachel	 Well honey, what about you?
75	Ross	 What?
76	Rachel	 I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
77	Ross	 No.
78	Rachel	 Come on you gotta have one!
79	Ross	 Nope.
80	Rachel	 Ross, you know what...
81	Ross	 What?
82	Rachel	 ...if you tell me, I might do it.
83	Ross	 Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
84	Rachel	 Yeah.
85	Ross	 Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
86	Rachel	 Oooh!
87	Ross	 Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
88	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there]
89	Phoebe	 Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
90	Rachel	 Really!
91	Phoebe	 Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
92	Rachel	 Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
93	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
94	Rachel	 Really! That-that great huh?
95	Phoebe	 No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
96	Ross	 (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
97	Rachel	 Hi you guys!
98	Ross	 Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
99	Rachel	 Mon. Hi!
100	Monica	 Hi.
101	Rachel	 Why aren't you at work?
102	Monica	 Oh, they-they sent me home.
103	Rachel	 Why?
104	Monica	 Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
105	Ross	 Okay.
106	Rachel	 You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
107	Monica	 I know I do.
108	Ross	 Hi.
109	Rachel	 Hi.
110	Ross	 Guess what?
111	Rachel	 What?
112	Ross	 They published my paper.
113	Rachel	 Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
114	Phoebe	 Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. (Ross stands up horrified) There he is.
115	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching Wheel of Fortune, the puzzle is showing _oun_ Rush_ore.]
116		[Chandler enters]
117	Chandler	 Hey!
118	Joey	 Wheel!
119	Chandler	 Of!
120	Joey	 Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!
121	Chandler	 You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
122	Joey	 I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
123	Chandler	 No, Janice.
124	Joey	 Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
125	Chandler	 You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
126	Joey	 No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
127	Chandler	 Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
128	Joey	 Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
129	Chandler	 Well, there you go.
130	Joey	 Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
131	Chandler	 Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
132	Joey	 Look, what do you want me to say?
133	Chandler	 I want you to say that you like her!
134	Joey	 I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
135	Chandler	 Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
136	Joey	 Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')
137		Commercial Break
138	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are entering]
139	Ross	 How could you have told her?
140	Rachel	 Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
141	Ross	 Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
142	Rachel	 Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
143	Ross	 Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
144	Rachel	 Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
145	Ross	 That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
146	Rachel	 Were both of those Joey?
147	Ross	 Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
148	Rachel	 Not even with your best friend.
149	Ross	 Noo!
150	Rachel	 That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
151	Ross	 Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
152	Rachel	 Pretty much.
153	Ross	 Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
154	Rachel	 Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
155	Ross	 I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
156	[Scene	 Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is trying to relax her.]
157	Phoebe	 ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
158	Monica	 Richard's living room, drinking wine.
159	Phoebe	 All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
160	Monica	 I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
161	Phoebe	 Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
162	Monica	 All right, I'll try not to.
163	Phoebe	 Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
164	Monica	 Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
165	Phoebe	 All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
166	Monica	 I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
167	Phoebe	 All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
168	Monica	 Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
169	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's]
170	Janice	 So, I hear, you hate me!
171	Joey	 I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
172	Janice	 A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
173	Joey	 And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
174	Janice	 All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea
175	Joey	 But what does that gonna do...
176	Janice	 For Chandler!
177	Joey	 Okay. I'm in.
178	Janice	 Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it
179	Joey	 Does it have to be a whole day?
180	Janice	 Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
181	Joey	 Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
182	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are entering]
183	Monica	 (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
184	Phoebe	 Monica, do you want us to take you home?
185	Monica	 Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)
186	Ross	 Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
187	Chandler	 Umm, yeah.
188	Ross	 No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
189	Chandler	 Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
190	Ross	 Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
191	Chandler	 We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
192	Ross	 Nooo!
193	Chandler	 Yeah, okay.
194	Ross	 Yeah?
195	Chandler	 Yeah! All right! You go first.
196	Ross	 Okay, okay, I'll go first.
197	Chandler	 Okay.
198	Ross	 So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
199	Chandler	 Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
200	Ross	 Yes!
201	Chandler	 I know!
202	Ross	 Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
203	Chandler	 Okay.
204	Ross	 Okay.
205	Chandler	 Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
206	Ross	 Hmph.
207	Chandler	 And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
208	Ross	 With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
209	Chandler	 I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
210	Ross	 Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
211	Chandler	 You said...
212	Ross	 I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
213	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Janice are returning from their DAY OF FUN!]
214	Janice	 We're baack!
215	Joey	 Hey!
216	Chandler	 What are you guys doing together?
217	Janice	 Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)
218	Chandler	 Really.
219	Joey	 Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
220	Janice	 I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)
221	Chandler	 You still can't stand her can you?
222	Joey	 I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
223	Chandler	 Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
224	Joey	 But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
225	Chandler	 Well, I guess that's something.
226	Joey	 No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
227	Chandler	 Okay.
228	Joey	 Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
229	Chandler	 Oh God!
230	Joey	 Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
231	Chandler	 Really?
232	Joey	 Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.

235		(Monica answers the door)
236	Monica	 Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
237	Mr. Geller	 Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?
238	Monica	 I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
239	Mr. Geller	 Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
240	Monica	 What makes you think that I might not be okay?
241	Mr. Geller	 I saw Richard.
242	Monica	 Oh.
243	Mr. Geller	 So, how are you doing?
244	Monica	 I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
245	Mr. Geller	 You don't wanna know.
246	Monica	 No, I really, really do.
247	Mr. Geller	 Well, he's doing terrible!
248	Monica	 Really!
249	Mr. Geller	 Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
250	Monica	 You're not just saying that are you?
251	Mr. Geller	 No, the man is a mess.
252	Monica	 Was he crying?
253	Mr. Geller	 No.
254	Monica	 Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
255	Mr. Geller	 Maybe.
256	Monica	 I think so.
257	Mr. Geller	 Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks up the cigar, and starts watching the video)

260	Rachel	 Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
261	Ross	 No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom standing where Rachel is)
262	Mrs. Geller	 Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
