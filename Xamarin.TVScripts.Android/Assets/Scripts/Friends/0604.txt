2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is packing her belongings to move to Ross’s. She’s standing in the kitchen.]
3	Rachel	 So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
4	Monica	 This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
5	Rachel	 And?
6	Monica	 And it’s a magnet!
7	Rachel	 Look at that!
8	Ross	 How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
9	Rachel	 What?!
10	Ross	 (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!
11	Phoebe	 Ross, I know what you’re thinking.
12	Ross	 What?
13	Phoebe	 That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.
14	Ross	 Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
15	Phoebe	 What?!!
16	Ross	 Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
17	Phoebe	 No! (Ross’s phone rings.)
18	Ross	 (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
19		[Cut to the living room where Monica is helping pack a box.]
20	Monica	 Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?
21	Rachel	 No-no, I bought those.
22	Monica	 Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
23	Rachel	 Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
24	Monica	 (under her breath) That you’re a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)
25	Ross	 (on phone) No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
26	Monica	 Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
27	Ross	 Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
28	Rachel	 Well, who wouldn’t?!
29	Ross	 I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
30	Phoebe	 Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
31	Rachel	 And Mrs.?!
32	Phoebe	 Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.
33	Rachel	 What?!!
34	Phoebe	 Just kidding!
35	Rachel	 Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)
36	Phoebe	 (To Ross) Saved your ass.
37		Opening Credits
38	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are all there as Phoebe enters dejectedly.]
39	Chandler	 Hey!
40	Phoebe	 Hi.
41	Monica	 Hey!
42	Chandler	 Oh, what’s the matter?
43	Phoebe	 Well, you know that psychic I see?
44	Chandler	 Yeah?
45	Phoebe	 Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.
46	Chandler	 What?!
47	Phoebe	 Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
48	Monica	 Phoebe that’s crazy!
49	Joey	 I can’t believe she would say that too you.
50	Rachel	 Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
51	Phoebe	 I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
52	Chandler	 Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
53	Phoebe	 No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)
54	Ross	 (entering) Hey everyone!
55	Chandler	 Oh hi!
56	Ross	 Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
57		(They pause to think about it.)
58	All	 Oh that’d be great. Sure!
59	Ross	 (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"
60	Phoebe	 Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.
61	Ross	 (continuing) "…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…"
62	Joey	 (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
63	Ross	 No! Why?
64	Joey	 Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.
65	Ross	 Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into…"
66	Chandler	 Why don’t you open with a joke?
67	Ross	 Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!
68	Chandler	 Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!
69	Ross	 (gets up) Okay!
70	All	 Ohh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!
71	Rachel	 Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
72	Ross	 Thank you!
73	Rachel	 Some uh, some visual aides.
74	Joey	 Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?
75	Ross	 Please don’t say naked chicks.
76	Joey	 Why not?!
77	Ross	 I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
78	Chandler	 That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.
79	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is playing that string game with the two hands and the weird crossing patterns as Chandler enters with the mail.]
80	Chandler	 Hey.
81	Joey	 Hey! Any good mail?
82	Chandler	 Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.
83	Joey	 Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….
84	Chandler	 (opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."
85	Joey	 Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
86	Chandler	 Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.
87	Joey	 Let me see that!
88	Chandler	 All right.
89	Joey	 (reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
90	Chandler	 I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
91	Joey	 All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.
92	Chandler	 Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
93	Joey	 (mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
94	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe enters to find Rachel still packing.]
95	Phoebe	 Hey!
96	Rachel	 Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?
97	Phoebe	 Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
98	Rachel	 Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
99	Phoebe	 I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
100	Rachel	 Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
101	Phoebe	 Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.
102		(Phoebe goes and lies down as Rachel opens the drawer Monica hid the candlesticks in and as Monica walks out of her room.)
103	Rachel	 Monica!
104	Monica	 Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
105	Rachel	 Did-did you take these back?
106	Monica	 No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
107	Rachel	 Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?
108	Monica	 I loved them!
109	Rachel	 Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
110	Ross	 (entering) Hello!
111	Monica	 Hey!
112	Rachel	 Hey!
113	Monica	 How’d the lecture go?
114	Ross	 It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
115	Rachel	 Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.
116	Ross	 I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
117	Monica	 That you’re not funny or sexy?
118	Ross	 That’s right!
119	[Scene	 Estelle Leonard Theatrical Agency, Joey is there to see his agent.]
120	Joey	 (entering) Hey Estelle, listen…
121	Estelle	 Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
122	Joey	 What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!
123	Estelle	 Really?!
124	Joey	 Yeah!
125	Estelle	 Oh well, no harm, no foul.
126	Joey	 Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
127	Estelle	 All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
128	Joey	 Why?
129	Estelle	 Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
130	Joey	 Bastard!
131	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler enters to find Joey lying in the fetus position on the floor.]
132	Chandler	 Hey!
133	Joey	 (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.
134	Chandler	 That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?
135	Joey	 What?!
136	Chandler	 What’s wrong with you?
137	Joey	 Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
138	Chandler	 This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!
139	Joey	 No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)
140	Chandler	 That’s a hernia.
141	Joey	 Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!
142	[Scene	 a NYU lecture hall, Rachel and Monica are arriving to talk to Ross after the lecture, but are there early.]
143	Rachel	 Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.
144	Monica	 Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.
145	Rachel	 Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.
146		(They enter the lecture hall to find Ross speaking in an English accent for some unknown reason.)
147	Ross	 (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
148		Commercial Break
149	[Scene	 a NYU lecture hall, the scene is continued from earlier, only Ross has dismissed the class and is now talking to Monica and Rachel.]
150	Monica	 What the hell are you doing?!
151	Ross	 Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
152	Rachel	 Yeah, and not a very good one.
153	Ross	 Will you-will you please?
154		(Another professor walks down from the back of the lecture hall.)
155	The Professor	 Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the paleontology department here.
156	Ross	 Oh.
157	The Professor	 Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
158	Ross	 (in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.
159	Monica	 (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’)
160	Ross	 (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
161	Monica	 (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To an exiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!
162	Ross	 Just please stop!
163		(They turn back to Rachel and Professor Rathman.)
164	Rachel	 (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
165	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is reading on the couch while Joey, still suffering from his hernia, is returning with coffee for them both. After a series of grunts and groans he manages to painfully walk back from the counter, sit down, and slide Chandler his coffee.]
166	Chandler	 Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
167	Joey	 Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.
168	Chandler	 I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.
169	Joey	 Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
170		(Phoebe enters.)
171	Phoebe	 Hey!
172	Chandler	 Hey.
173	Joey	 Hey!
174	Phoebe	 What’s going on?
175	Chandler	 Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!
176	Joey	 Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married…With Children always used to do.) it doesn’t hurt that bad.
177	Phoebe	 Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
178	Joey	 Sure, now I’m scared.
179	Phoebe	 No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
180	Joey	 Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!
181	Phoebe	 No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
182	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are having a tug-of-war over the disputed candlesticks.]
183	Monica	 Gimme ‘em!
184	Rachel	 No! They are mine!
185	Monica	 You stole them from me!
186	Rachel	 You stole them from me!!
187	Monica	 Gimme them!
188		(With one last mighty tug the combatants lose their grip and split, each holding one candlestick.)
189	Monica	 You just wanna each take one?
190	Rachel	 Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
191	Ross	 (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
192	Rachel	 Well…
193	Monica	 Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.
194	Rachel	 Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!
195	Ross	 They’re not listening too me?
196	Rachel	 Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
197	Ross	 Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
198	Monica	 I think you look fine.
199	[Scene	 Casting Director #1’s office, Joey is on his first audition. His partner is an 8-year-old boy.]
200	Casting Director #1	 Whenever you’re ready.
201	Joey	 (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you."
202	Casting Director #1	 Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less…intense?
203	Joey	 Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. (He turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.) "Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!"
204	Casting Director #1	 Oh my God!!
205		(Joey pulls his hand out and reverts back to intense pain.)
206	[Scene	 Casting Director #2’s office, Joey is on his second audition. This one is for Purina One Dog Chow, an actual item. Please note the gratuitous product placement.]
207	Joey	 So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! (He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won’t be able to pick it up.)
208	Casting Director #2	 That’s where you pick up the bag.
209	Joey	 Exactly.
210	Casting Director #2	 No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
211	Joey	 Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn’t get it, did I?
212	Casting Director #2	 No.
213	Joey	 Yeah, okay. (Leaves)
214	[Scene	 Casting Director #3’s office, Joey is entering.]
215	Joey	 Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for (Groans) man.
216	Casting Director #3	 You mean dying man?
217	Joey	 Yes!
218	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are playing phone pranks on Ross.]
219	Monica	 Okay, come on, do it one more time!
220	Rachel	 Really? Really?!
221	Monica	 Yes!
222	Rachel	 Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
223	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
224	Rachel	 Hey!
225	Phoebe	 Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!
226	Rachel	 Really?! How do you know?
227	Phoebe	 Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!
228	Rachel	 Oh, I’m sorry.
229	Phoebe	 Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!
230	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, Joey has won the part of dying man and is now able to play the role he was injured for. Chandler is helping to carry him in.]
231	Chandler	 Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.
232	Joey	 (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.
233	Chandler	 But are you sure you can do this?
234	Joey	 Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
235		(Chandler steps away quickly.)
236	Chandler	 Now, is that never talking about it again?!
237	Joey	 (to the director) Hiya!
238	The Director	 Hey Joey, we’re ready for ya! (Joey stumbles over) Joey, this is Alex he’s going to be playing your son.
239	Joey	 Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)
240	The Director	 Okay. (to Alex) All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that’s your cue to cry. Got it? (Alex nods yes.) All right, let’s do this.
241		(Joey lies down on the gurney.)
242	A Crew Member	 (with that board thingy) Scene 5, take 1.
243	The Director	 And Action!
244	Joey	 "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on son! Your Momma’s good people!"
245	The Director	 Cut! Alex, remember you’re supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
246	Alex	 Okay.
247	The Director	 All right, from the top.
248	A Crew Member	 Scene 5, take 2.
249		[Time lapse.]
250	A Crew Member	 Take 36 is up!
251	The Director	 All right! Let’s try this again! You ready Joe?
252	Joey	 Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
253	The Director	 Uh sure.
254	Joey	 Okay. (Starts screaming.)
255	The Director	 Action!
256	Joey	 (he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma son." (Again Alex does nothing.)
257	The Director	 Cut!!!!!!!!!! (Joey starts screaming again.)
258		(Chandler decides to help out.)
259	Chandler	 I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
260	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel’s apartment, Rachel is unpacking as the phone rings.]
261	Rachel	 (answering it) Hello?
262	Russell	 (Ross’s divorce lawyer.) Hello, is Ross there?
263	Rachel	 Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?
264	Russell	 Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.
265	Rachel	 Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
266	[Scene	 a NYU lecture hall, Ross is trying to phase out his accent.]
267	Ross	 (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
268	A Student	 What’s happening to your accent?
269	Ross	 (British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…
270		(At this moment Rachel bursts through the door. Needless to say, she’s not in the best of moods having just found out Ross’s dirty little secret.)
271	Rachel	 Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
272	Ross	 (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!
273		Ending Credits
274	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is holding a football helmet; and apparently, in a rather disgusting scene, Joey wants Phoebe to beat him senseless. (Luckily it isn’t a long trip.) Because he’s made a miraculous recovery from his hernia and wants to take advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since he’s re-established his health insurance.]
275	Phoebe	 Have you really done this before?
276	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
277	Phoebe	 Hey!
278	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey!
279	Chandler	 What are you doing?
280	Phoebe	 We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
281	Chandler	 Oh, all right.
282		(Decided that they are less than human as well, Chandler picks up a golf club and Monica a frying pan, to join in on the fun of beating their good friend to within an inch of his life!)
