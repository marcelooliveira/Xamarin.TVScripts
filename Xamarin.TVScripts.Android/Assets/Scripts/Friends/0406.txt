2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and a beautiful blonde (Cheryl) are standing outside. The rest of the gang is watching from inside.]
3	Cheryl	 So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
4	Ross	 You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
5		[inside]
6	Phoebe	 Hey what are you guys looking at?
7	Chandler	 Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
8	Phoebe	 Yeah, come to papa.
9		[Cheryl walks away and Ross walks inside. Everyone stares at him in disbelief.]
10	Ross	 I know!
11	Monica	 Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
12	Chandler	 Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?
13	Rachel	 Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
14	Ross	 Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
15	Chandler	 Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
16	Ross	 I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
17	Rachel	 Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
18	Ross	 Fine by me; hope she wins.
19		Opening Credits
20	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's. Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Chandler enters.]
21	Chandler	 Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
22	Phoebe	 Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
23	Chandler	 Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
24	Phoebe	 Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
25	Chandler	 Well, I have a call in about that.
26	Phoebe	 'Kay.
27	Chandler	 Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
28	Rachel	 Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
29	Chandler	 Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
30	Rachel	 Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
31	Chandler	 Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
32	Rachel	 Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
33	Phoebe	 Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
34	Chandler	 It doesn't say that. Does it?
35	Ross	 How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
36	Chandler	 Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
37	Phoebe	 It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
38	Monica	 (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
39	Rachel	 Oh my God! What happened?
40	Monica	 Sixty guests.
41	Ross	 So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
42	Monica	 Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
43	Phoebe	 Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
44	Monica	 I don't know.
45	Phoebe	 There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
46	Monica	 Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
47	Phoebe	 Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
48	Monica	 Well, you're not working either.
49	Phoebe	 Yes, but I'm doing this.
50	Monica	 Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
51		[Joey enters]
52	Joey	 Hey!
53	Everyone	 Hey.
54	Kathy	 Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
55	Joey	 Why?
56		[Kathy whispers something in Joey's ear]
57	Joey	 You can pee here!
58	Kathy	 Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
59	Chandler	 It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
60	Joey	 We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
61	Everyone	 Yeah!
62	Rachel	 Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
63	Joey	 Oh, I know...
64	Rachel	 And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
65		[cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe is nearby.]
66	Phoebe	 Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
67	Rachel	 No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
68	Phoebe	 Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
69		[Monica enters]
70	Monica	 Hey!
71	Rachel	 Hey, how'd it go?
72	Monica	 Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
73	Phoebe	 Mon! I'm so happy for you!
74	Monica	 Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
75	Phoebe	 I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
76	Monica	 Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
77	Phoebe	 Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
78	Monica	 Okay.
79	[Scene	 Outside Cheryl's apartment, Ross and Cheryl are kissing]
80	Ross	 (moved by the kiss) Huh...
81	Cheryl	 Um, would you like to come in?
82	Ross	 Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
83	Cheryl	 According to recent findings!
84		[They go into the apartment. Inside the apartment it looks like a sewage dump exploded and landed in her living room. There are clothes and food and junk covering every square inch of space. I mean pigs have nicer pens. Ross is completely shocked.]
85	Cheryl	 (throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
86	Ross	 Mitzi is.....
87	Cheryl	 My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
88	Ross	 (mouths "where?") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
89	Cheryl	 What?
90	Ross	 Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
91	Cheryl	 I'd rather not.
92	Ross	 Oh, yeah, why not?
93	Cheryl	 Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
94	[Scene	 A kitchen where Phoebe and Monica are finishing up a catering job]
95	Monica	 Oh, is everything in the car?
96	Phoebe	 Yes. Did you settle the bill?
97	Monica	 No. I hate this part.
98	Phoebe	 Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)
99	Monica	 No, that's not mine.
100	Phoebe	 Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
101		[cut to the living room of the same dwelling, where the funeral guests are mingling. Monica enters.]
102	Monica	 Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
103	Mrs. Burkart	 Oh, good. Thank you.
104	Monica	 Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
105	Mrs. Burkart	 Dear?
106	Monica	 Just the matter of ...payment?
107	Mrs. Burkart	 (in grief) Jack used to handle the finances! (Breaks into tears)
108	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on the couch still doing the crossword. Chandler is in the kitchen.]
109	Rachel	 You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
110	Chandler	 (confused) Sure...
111	Rachel	 And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
112	Chandler	 I don't know... um, Grease?
113	Rachel	 No....
114	Chandler	 Rent?
115	Rachel	 Yes! Rent!
116	Chandler	 Okay, so when do you want to go?
117	Rachel	 What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
118	Joey	 (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
119	Chandler	 Yes, it is, at Office Max.
120	Rachel	 What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)
121	Chandler	 A pen.
122	Joey	 It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
123	Chandler	 Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
124	Joey	 Why not?
125	Chandler	 Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
126	Rachel	 Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
127	Joey	 Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
128	Chandler	 All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
129	Joey	 She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
130	Chandler	 For three years?
131	Joey	 (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
132	Chandler	 All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
133	Joey	 Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
134	Chandler	 Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
135	Joey	 Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
136	[Scene	 Back in the kitchen at the funeral. Phoebe is there, Monica enters.]
137	Phoebe	 But Mon, you have to get our money!
138	Monica	 Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
139	Phoebe	 I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
140	Monica	 What?
141	Phoebe	 Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
142	Monica	 Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
143	Phoebe	 Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
144	Monica	 Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
145		[cut to the living room where Mrs. Burkart is now performing.]
146	Mrs. Burkart	 (singing) You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
147	Phoebe	 She seems fine now.
148	Mrs. Burkart	 (singing) ...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
149		Commercial Break
150	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are standing and talking, Ross is tying a tie.]
151	Joey	 So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
152	Ross	 You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
153	Joey	 Yeah.
154	Ross	 Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.
155	Joey	 Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
156	Ross	 What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
157	Joey	 All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
158	Ross	 No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
159	Joey	 What kind of smell?
160	Ross	 I don't know. Soap?
161	Joey	 All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
162	Ross	 Yeah.
163	Joey	 You wanna see her again, right?
164	Ross	 Yeah.
165	Joey	 So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
166	Ross	 Yeah, okay you're right.
167	Joey	 Yeah.
168	Ross	 I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
169	Joey	 Yeah!
170	Ross	 It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
171	Joey	 All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!
172	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel, Rachel is there, Chandler enters.]
173	Chandler	 Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
174	Rachel	 Any luck?
175	Chandler	 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
176	Rachel	 All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
177	Chandler	 She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
178	Rachel	 Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
179	Chandler	 Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
180	Rachel	 Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)
181	Joey	 (entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
182	Chandler	 Where?
183	Joey	 Our place, the hall! I...
184	Chandler	 I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!
185	Joey	 (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?
186	Chandler	 No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
187	Joey	 You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
188	Chandler	 No, it came out to an even twenty.
189	Joey	 Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
190	[Scene	 In the living room at the funeral]
191	Mrs. Burkart	 (singing) Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
192		[cut to Monica and Phoebe in the kitchen]
193	Phoebe	 You didn't get the money, did you?
194	Monica	 Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
195	Phoebe	 No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?
196	Mrs. Burkart	 (Singing) Come on along and listen to...
197	Phoebe	 Okay, Widow!
198	Mrs. Burkart	 (Singing) ...the lullabye of...
199	Phoebe	 Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
200	Mrs. Burkart	 All right. I'll get my bag.
201	Phoebe	 Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)
202	Monica	 I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
203	[Scene	 Outside Cheryl's apartment.]
204	Cheryl	 So you want to come inside?
205	Ross	 (mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.)
206	Cheryl	 I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear a place for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Something falls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.)
207	Cheryl	 (sneaking up behind Ross) Guess who?
208	Ross	 Department of Sanitation?
209	Cheryl	 It's me!
210	Ross	 Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch. Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)
211	Cheryl	 What?
212	Ross	 (trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!
213	Cheryl	 Oh, Ross!
214		[They sit up, moaning in excitement, and Cheryl straddles Ross. Ross finds a slice of bologna and moans higher and louder, then a bag of potato chips on the coffee table starts to move. Ross throws Cheryl off his lap, grabs a tennis racket and a toilet brush and starts pounding the bag.]
215	Cheryl	 Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
216	Ross	 Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
217	Cheryl	 (looking in the bag) Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
218	[Scene	 Central Perk. Rachel is sitting on the couch alone working on a crossword puzzle. Gunther is there, going into the back room.]
219	Rachel	 I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
220		[From the background we hear a crash and Gunther comes running out of the back room, pushing people aside, reaching for Rachel.]
221	Gunther	 Move!
222		[Gunther slips and falls just before reaching the back of the couch. Monica and Phoebe come into Central Perk.]
223	Rachel	 Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
224		[Gunther gets up slowly from behind the couch and walks away sadly]
225	Phoebe	 Uh... yay!
226	Rachel	 Thanks!
227	Monica	 Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
228	Rachel	 Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
229	Monica	 Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
230	Phoebe	 Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
231	Monica	 And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
232	Phoebe	 Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
233	Monica	 Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
234	Phoebe	 Okay!
235	Monica	 I can cook and you can take care of the money.
236	Phoebe	 Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
237	Both	 (screaming with excitement) Aah!
238	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is there, Joey enters.]
239	Joey	 Hey!
240	Chandler	 Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
241	Joey	 Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
242	Chandler	 Oh yeah? That's great!
243	Joey	 Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
244	Chandler	 [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
245		[Kathy enters]
246	Kathy	 Hey.
247	Joey	 Hey!
248	Chandler	 Hey! Happy birthday.
249	Kathy	 Thank you!
250	Joey	 You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.
251	Chandler	 No he didn't. [Moving it back.]
252	Joey	 Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
253	Chandler	 Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
254	Kathy	 You really didn't have to. (Opens the box) Wow.
255	Chandler	 See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
256	Kathy	 Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug).
257	Chandler	 Oh, yeah... yeah.
258	Joey	 Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?
259	Kathy	 I'll be in in a minute.
260	Joey	 Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).
261	Chandler	 [to Kathy] Goodnight.
262	Kathy	 Um, thank you for the gift.
263	Chandler	 Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
264	Kathy	 No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
265	Chandler	 Uh, the book?
266	Kathy	 The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
267	Chandler	 What do you mean?
268	Kathy	 Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
269	Chandler	 (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
270	Kathy	 You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
271	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
272	Kathy	 Well....
273	Chandler	 Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)
274	Joey	 (opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

277	Monica	 Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
278	Cheryl	 Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
279	Monica	 Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
