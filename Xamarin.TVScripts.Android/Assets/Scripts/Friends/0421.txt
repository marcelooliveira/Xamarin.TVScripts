2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.]
3	Chandler	 Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
4	Joey	 I know. Ross is getting married.
5	Chandler	 Phoebe is, making people.
6	Joey	 Everybody’s doing stuff!
7	Chandler	 And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
8	Joey	 (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
9	Chandler	 No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
10	Joey	 No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
11	Chandler	 Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!
12	Joey	 Yeah!
13	Chandler	 We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
14	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
15	Joey	 Hey!
16	Phoebe	 What-what’s up?
17	Joey	 We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!
18	Chandler	 Yeah baby!
19	Phoebe	 Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!
20	Chandler	 (dejected) Yeah, well…
21	Joey	 We could get that Everest video though.
22	Chandler	 Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
23	Joey	 And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
24	Chandler	 (dejected) Oh, well…
25	Phoebe	 So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
26	Chandler	 Yeeeeahhhh.
27	Joey	 Yeah. Yeah.
28	Chandler	 But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
29	Joey	 Yeah we are!
30		Opening Credits
31	[Scene	 Ross’s apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.]
32	Emily	 So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
33	Ross	 Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)
34	Emily	 Yeah, they’re fine.
35	Ross	 Yeah?
36	Emily	 If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
37	Ross	 Sure. Why not?
38	Emily	 Really?
39	Ross	 Yeah?
40	Emily	 I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
41	Ross	 Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?
42	Emily	 Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.) More tea?
43	Ross	 Yeah sure.
44	Emily	 Earl Grey?

61	Rachel	 I knew.
62	Ross	 You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
63	Rachel	 I did.
64	Ross	 Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?

174	[Scene	 Rachel's bedroom, Rachel, entering selfish mode, is thanking Ross for wrongly taking the entire blame of the breakup; as if she had absolutely nothing to do with it.]
175	Rachel	 ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.” Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
176	Ross	 WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!

183	Rachel	 Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
184	Ross	 You think?
185	Rachel	 Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
186	Ross	 Hey, you’re right.

202	Monica	 I never knew that either.
203	Joey	 I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces.
204	Rachel	 (entering) Hey guys! What’s up?
205	Joey	 Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
206	Monica	 We’re hanging out.
207		(Rachel starts going through her mail, and come across her invitation.)
208	Rachel	 What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
209	Chandler	 See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.
210	Rachel	 Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.
211	Monica	 I’m sorry honey.

224	Phoebe	 Remembered what?
225	Rachel	 It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
226	Phoebe	 Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
227	Monica	 I can't believe he did this.
228	Chandler	 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
229		(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on Rachel.)

Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
341	Monica	 You don’t have a car. And your license expired.
342	Rachel	 I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
343		Closing Credits
344	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do whilst in London.]
345	Chandler	 All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) "It’s almost as good as being there."
346	Joey	 It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
347	Chandler	 Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
348	Joey	 I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
349	Chandler	 If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
350	Joey	 Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
