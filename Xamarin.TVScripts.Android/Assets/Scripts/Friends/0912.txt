3	[Scene	 Coffee place, Joey is there, Chandler is entering]
4	Chandler	 Hey
5	Joey	 Hey. So where's Mon?
6	Chandler	 Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
7	Joey	 And you're not helping?
8	Chandler	 I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
9		(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma in Rachel's hands)
10	Ross	 Hey you guys!
11	Joey and Chandler	 (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...
12	Rachel	 Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
13	Ross	 Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.
14	Joey and Chandler	 Hi.
15	Molly	 Hi.
16		(Emma starts to cry)
17	Ross	 Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
18	Joey	 You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
19	Rachel	 Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
20	Molly	 No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel).
21	Rachel	 OK, thank you.
22	Molly	 Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey).
23	Joey	 Yeah, you too.
24		(Molly leaves)
25	Rachel	 Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
26	Ross	 Yeah.
27	Chandler	 Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
28	Rachel	 What? You really think she's hot?
29	Chandler	 Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
30	Rachel	 And Joey?
31	Joey	 How do you think she's doing?
32	Rachel	 Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
33	Ross	 Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
34	Rachel	 Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
35	Chandler	 Now that Rachel's gone?
36	Rachel	 So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their hands)
37		OPENING CREDITS
38	[Scene	 Mike and Phoebe in Phoebe's place, Phoebe is doing a crossword puzzle]
39	Phoebe	 Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
40	Mike	 Lima.
41	Phoebe	 No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
42	Mike	 You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!
43	Phoebe	 What?
44	Mike	 OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
45	Phoebe	 (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
46	Mike	 What, is he your pet rat?
47	Phoebe	 Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
48	Mike	 You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
49	Phoebe	 What are those?
50	Mike	 I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
51	Phoebe	 OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
52	Mike	 Thank you.
53	Phoebe	 So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
54	[Scene	 Rachel's office, Rachel comes in and Gavin is there]
55	Rachel	 Hello.
56	Gavin	 Hello
57	Rachel	 Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
58	Gavin	 For what?
59	Rachel	 Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
60	Gavin	 Is this your first appology?
61	Rachel	 No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
62		(Heather walks in)
63	Heather	 Good morning!
64	Rachel	 Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
65	Gavin	 What?
66	Rachel	 I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
67	Gavin	 I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
68	Rachel	 Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
69	Gavin	 Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
70	Rachel	 Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
71	Gavin	 I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
72	Rachel	 That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
73	Gavin	 Huh. What's Tag's last name?
74	Rachel	 It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
75	Gavin	 But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
76	Rachel	 Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
77	Gavin	 It was Jones.
78	Rachel	 Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
79	[Scene	 Coffee place, Molly holding Emma and talking to Joey]
80	Joey	 Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
81	Molly	 You mean, when you were a baby.
82	Joey	 Sure.
83		(Chandler is staring at Molly)
84	Monica	 Would you stop staring at her?
85	Chandler	 I wasn't staring. I was leering.
86	Monica	 What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
87	Ross	 Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
88	Chandler	 Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
89	Monica	 Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
90	Molly	 (to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
91	Ross	 Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
92	Molly	 Bye
93	Monica	 They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
94	Molly	 I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)
95	Ross, Joey and Chandler	 Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
96	Rachel	 (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
97	Joey	 Why not?
98	Rachel	 Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
99	Joey	 So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.
100	Ross	 Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
101	Joey	 Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
102	Ross	 What are you, a child?
103	Joey	 Yes!
104	Ross	 Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
105	Joey	 Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)
106	Monica	 (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
107	[Scene	 Phoebe's place, Phoebe and Mike are there]
108	Phoebe	 Hey Mikey
109	Mike	 Hey P
110	Phoebe	 What are you doing?
111	Mike	 Setting rat traps.
112	Phoebe	 To kill Bob??
113	Mike	 No, no, to test his neck strength.
114	Phoebe	 No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
115	Mike	 Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
116	Phoebe	 I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
117	Mike	 Better think of a new name for him.
118	Phoebe	 I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
119	Mike	 I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...
120	Phoebe	 Oh my god, we killed Bob!
121	Mike	 Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
122	Phoebe	 Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
123	[Scene	 Mon and Chan's, Ross enters]
124	Ross	 Whazzup??
125	Chandler	 Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
126	Ross	 Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
127	Chandler	 You don't trust him?
128	Ross	 Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
129	Chandler	 Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
130	Ross	 You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
131	Chandler	 Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
132	Ross	 Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)
133	Chandler	 Picturing that tree?
134	Ross	 I am, yes.
135	[Scene	 Hallway, Joey get out of his appartment and Chandler jumps out of his]
136	Chandler	 Where you going, Joe?
137		(Joey falls on floor and gets up)
138	Joey	 For a walk.
139	Chandler	 Oh. You mind if I join you?
140	Joey	 Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
141	Chandler	 Your thoughts? Plural?
142	Joey	 Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
143	Chandler	 I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
144	Joey	 Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
145	Chandler	 Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
146	Joey	 Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
147	Chandler	 Great novels?
148	Joey	 Fine ... mediocre porn
149	[Scene	 Rachel's office, Rachel and Gavin there, phone rings, Gavin picks it up]
150	Gavin	 Gavin Mitchelle's office.
151	Rachel	 Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
152	Gavin	 Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)
153	Rachel	 Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
154	Gavin	 Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?
155	Rachel	 If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
156	Gavin	 Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you, don't I?
157	Rachel	 Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
158		(door knock, Monica enters)
159	Monica	 Hey Rach!
160	Rachel	 Hi!
161	Monica	 Ready for your birthday lunch?
162	Rachel	 Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
163	Gavin	 Pleased to meet you.
164	Monica	 Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
165	Rachel	 Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
166	Gavin	 Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. (leaves)
167	Rachel	 Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
168	Monica	 You were just being so nice to him!
169	Rachel	 I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
170		(A man walks by)
171	Rachel	 Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
172	Monica	 Right there! That was so fake!
173	Rachel	 Shh!
174	[Scene	 Rachel's birthday party]
175	Rachel	 (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
176	Monica	 Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
177	Rachel	 God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
178	Monica	 Does he?
179	Rachel	 What?
180	Monica	 Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
181	Rachel	 Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
182	Molly	 (with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
183	Rachel	 Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys see in her?
184	Monica	 Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
185		(Joey comes over)
186	Joey	 Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
187	Rachel	 Yeah, sure!
188	Joey	 Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after Molly)
189	Monica	 Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
190	Rachel	 Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
191	Phoebe	 Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
192	Mike	 Yeah. We have rat babies now.
193	Rachel	 Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
194	Monica	 So this is what a stroke feels like.
195	Phoebe	 I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
196	Rachel	 Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
197	Phoebe	 No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
198	Rachel	 whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
199	Phoebe	 Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
200		(Ross gets out of the bathroom, sees Chandler)
201	Ross	 Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
202	Chandler	 (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
203	Ross	 We have to stop them before something happens!
204	Chandler	 (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)
205	[Scene	 Ross's place, Molly and Joey are talking on the couch]
206	Joey	 So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
207	Molly	 So where did you study?
208	Joey	 Oh, I didn't go to college.
209	Molly	 No, where did you study acting?
210	Joey	 Molly ... people don't study acting ...
211		(Ross and Chandler walk in, Joey looks disappointed)
212	Ross	 Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
213	Molly	 Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
214	Ross	 Thanx.
215		(Molly gets up and walks away)
216	Joey	 (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
217	Ross	 What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
218	Joey	 No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
219		(pause)
220	Ross and Chandler	 Come on! Joe!
221	Joey	 Ok (admits)
222		(knock on door, Ross opens, it's a woman)
223	Woman	 Hi, is Molly here?
224	Ross	 Yeah, come on in. Molly?
225	Molly	 (goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow.
226	Ross	 Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
227	Joey	 It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
228	[Scene	 Phoebe's place, Phoebe and Mike enter]
229	Phoebe	 Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
230	Mike	 Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
231	Phoebe	 Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
232	Mike	 Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
233	Phoebe	 Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
234	Mike	 Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
235	Phoebe	 No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
236	Mike	 Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
237	Phoebe	 Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
238	Mike	 It's gonna be ok.
239	Phoebe	 You must think I'm crazy.
240	Mike	 No, I think you're sweet.
241	Phoebe	 Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
242	[Scene	 Rachel's party, Rachel is on the balcony, Monica goes there also]
243	Monica	 Hey!
244	Rachel	 Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
245	Monica	 No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
246	Rachel	 Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
247	Monica	 Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
248	Rachel	 Mmm hmm.
249	Gavin	 Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)
250	Monica	 Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
251	Rachel	 No.
252		(Monica goes back inside)
253	Gavin	 Nice party.
254	Rachel	 Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9
255	Monica	 (from inside) Again, you're welcome.
256	Gavin	 Look, I'll just give you this and go.
257	Rachel	 Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
258	Gavin	 Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
259	Rachel	 Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). "From Gavin"
260	Gavin	 I really mean it.
261	Rachel	 (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
262	Gavin	 You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!
263	Rachel	 See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
264	Gavin	 I'm not sure.
265	Rachel	 Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
266	Gavin	 I do have feelings for you.
267	Rachel	 You do?
268	Gavin	 Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
269	Rachel	 See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
270		[cut to Ross from his appartment, holding baby toys and is shocked to see them kissing]
271		ENDING CREDITS
272	Chandler	 (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)
273	Phoebe	 (walks in) Hey
274	Chandler	 (normal voice) Hi
275	Phoebe	 Listen, I think I've left something here.
276	Chandler	 Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
277	Phoebe	 (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
278	Chandler	 Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
279	Monica	 Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)
280	Phoebe	 (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!
