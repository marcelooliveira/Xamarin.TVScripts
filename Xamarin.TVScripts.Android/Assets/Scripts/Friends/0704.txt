3	Mac	 (on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don’t mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel, Chandler, and Monica aren’t amused.)
4	C.H.E.E.S.E	 You can say that again Mac.
5	Mac	 Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.
6	C.H.E.E.S.E	 Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stop blinking 12
7		(They both break into a huge laugh and do that stop-motion thing they had at the end of ChiPs.)
8	Joey	 (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?
9		(They all make happy faces as they are unable to express their feelings verbally. Finally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by Monica.)
10	Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it’s your mom. (Hands him the phone.)
11	Chandler	 It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
12	Ross	 Ohhhh…
13	Rachel	 That’s nice.
14	Joey	 (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)
15	Rachel	 Well that was umm…Okay.
16	Ross	 It wasn’t the best.
17	Chandler	 That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
18	Monica	 Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
19	Ross	 Well, the lighting was okay.
20	Rachel	 Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
21	Monica	 And I have costumes.
22	Ross	 Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!"
23		(Phoebe gets up.)
24	Rachel	 What are you gonna do Pheebs?
25	Phoebe	 I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.
26	Chandler	 And say nothing?
27	Phoebe	 Uh-huh, yeah that’s right.
28	Joey	 (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasn’t that good.
29		Opening Credits
30	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Monica are reading on the couch.]
31	Monica	 Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
32	Phoebe	 What? You mean behind my back?
33	Rachel	 (entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe what happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…
34	Joey	 (entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
35	Rachel	 Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
36	Joey	 Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
37	Rachel	 Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.
38	Joey	 I’m gonna be on two TV shows!
39	Monica and Phoebe	 Oh, that’s great!!
40	Rachel	 Joey!
41	Joey	 Oh, you weren’t finished?
42	Rachel	 Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
43	Joey	 Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
44	Rachel	 It’s the same story.
45	Joey	 (groans in disgust) Wow, it’s really long.
46	Rachel	 (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
47	Monica	 Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
48	Rachel	 Yeah!
49	Monica	 I’m so happy for you!

53	Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh God!
54	Rachel	 I got—I get a big pay raise!
55	Phoebe	 Oh hey!
56	Joey	 I’ll be playing Drake Ramoray’s twin brother, Stryker!
57	Monica	 Oooh!
58	Rachel	 I get to hire my own assistant!
59	Monica and Phoebe	 Ahhh!!
60	Joey	 (jumps up) Well—I got a head rush from standing up too fast right there.
61	[Scene	 Rachel’s New Office, she’s interviewing a potential new assistant, Hilda.]
62	Rachel	 (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
63	Hilda	 That’s right.
64	Rachel	 Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
65	Hilda	 What?
66	Rachel	 I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.
67	Hilda	 No dear. It’s not.
68	Rachel	 No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in, it was nice to meet you.
69	Hilda	 Thank you! Good meeting you.
70	Rachel	 All right. (Hilda exits) I’m a total pro!
71		(There’s a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.)
72	Man	 Hello?
73	Rachel	 (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.
74	Man	 Actually, I’m here about the assistant job.
75	Rachel	 Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?
76	Man	 Tag Jones.
77	Rachel	 Uh-huh, go on.
78	Tag	 That’s it. That’s my whole name.
79	Rachel	 That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)
80	Tag	 I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…
81	Rachel	 Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!
82	Tag	 It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…
83	Rachel	 Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
84	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.]
85	Chandler	 No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
86	Phoebe	 (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
87	Monica	 (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
88	Chandler	 Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
89	Monica	 I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
90	Chandler	 Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
91	Monica	 Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
92	Chandler	 No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
93	Monica	 Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
94	Chandler	 Oh no-no, I can’t do that.
95	Monica	 If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.
96	Chandler	 Okay.
97	Monica	 Okay.
98	Chandler	 So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
99	Monica	 Oh my God. He threw up?
100	Chandler	 No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?
101	Monica	 Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
102	Chandler	 That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
103	Monica	 That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
104	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
105	Rachel	 Chandler, you have an assistant right?
106	Chandler	 (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
107	Rachel	 No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…
108	Chandler	 What about him?
109	Rachel	 I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.
110	Phoebe	 Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.
111	Rachel	 Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!
112	Phoebe	 Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
113	Rachel	 Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
114	Chandler	 Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
115	[Scene	 The Days of Our Lives producer’s office, Joey is entering to find Terry there.]
116	Terry	 Hey-hey-hey Joey!
117	Joey	 Hey Terry!
118	Terry	 Good to see you again!
119	Joey	 It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller than they used to.
120	Terry	 It’s a different building.
121	Joey	 So! Stryker Ramoray huh? When do you want me to start?
122	Terry	 Why don’t we start right now!
123	Joey	 Okay.
124	Terry	 Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)
125	Joey	 (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
126	Terry	 Why would you think that?
127	Joey	 Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
128	Terry	 Everybody has to audition.
129	Joey	 Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.
130	Terry	 I’m sorry Joey that’s…that’s the way it is.
131	Joey	 Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
132	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, she’s there as Tag knocks on the door and enters carrying a plant.]
133	Rachel	 Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
134	Tag	 I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first… (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.
135	Rachel	 Kinda.
136	Tag	 Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put "good at noticing stuff" on my resume. (Sets the plant down on her desk.)
137	Rachel	 Oh-ohh, thank you.
138	Tag	 Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.
139	Rachel	 Well…
140	Tag	 Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)
141	Rachel	 But I hired you!
142	Tag	 What?
143	Rachel	 Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!
144	Tag	 I am?!
145	Rachel	 Yeah!
146	Tag	 I can’t believe it!
147	Rachel	 Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
148	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is setting the table for dinner as Chandler enters.]
149	Chandler	 Hey.
150	Monica	 Hey! Good, you’re home!
151	Chandler	 Oh it’s always nicer to hear than, "Aw crap! You again!"
152	Monica	 Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
153	Chandler	 Hey.
154	Monica	 I made you a surprise.
155	Chandler	 Oh yeah?
156	Monica	 Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.
157	Chandler	 Did you not understand the story?
158	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
159	Chandler	 Hey! What’s up?
160	Monica	 Ross!
161	Ross	 Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.
162	Chandler	 Huh.
163	Ross	 (notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
164	Chandler	 No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
165	Ross	 What you got over there? Tacos?
166	Monica	 No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)
167	Ross	 Uhh, those are tacos.
168	Monica	 Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
169	Ross	 Eh, either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What’s so funny?!
170	Monica	 (trying not to laugh) I’m not laughing.
171		(Ross and Chandler move closer to her and she starts laughing again.)
172	Ross	 (To Chandler) You told her!
173	Chandler	 Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
174	Ross	 (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I chose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
175	Monica	 You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)
176	Ross	 (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
177	Chandler	 I had to okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
178	Ross	 Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
179	Chandler	 Du-ude!
180	Monica	 (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
181	Ross	 Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…
182	Chandler	 Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
183	Ross	 And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
184	Monica	 (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
185	Chandler	 In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
186	Ross	 Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…
187	Chandler	 Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
188	Ross	 Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.

203	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are still giving away all of their secrets.]

207	Monica	 Oh my God! (Laughing)
208	Ross	 Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
209	Monica	 I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
210	Ross	 Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
211	Monica	 Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
212	Ross	 Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
213	Monica	 It’s hard for some people!
214	Chandler	 (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!
215	Monica	 Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
216	Chandler	 Hey!!!
217	Monica	 Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of any more for Ross!
218	Ross	 Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
219	Chandler	 That was you!
220	Ross	 Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
221	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is still bumming about cancellation of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.]
222	Joey	 How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!
223	Rachel	 Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
224	Joey	 Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
225	Phoebe	 What happened?
226	Joey	 Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
227	Rachel	 Joey, why would you do that?
228	Joey	 Because they wanted me to audition!
229	Phoebe	 You! An actor?! That’s madness!

241	Phoebe	 Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
242	Rachel	 (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)
243	Phoebe	 So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
244	Rachel	 All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you…
245	Phoebe	 But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
246	Rachel	 Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes?
247		(Kathy enters (Because she’s listed in the credits).)

255	Joey	 Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
256	Terry	 I can’t help you Joey.
257	Joey	 Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.

260	Nurse #2	 It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
261		(Stryker enters, only it’s not Joey playing him.)
262	Dr. Stryker Ramoray	 Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and whispers to him.) Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?

264	Joey	 (jumping up and removing the bandages) I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
265	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are sitting there and not talking to each other.]
266	Monica	 Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
267	Ross	 And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
268	Chandler	 (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
269	Monica	 No!
270	Chandler	 Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
271	Monica	 I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
272	Chandler	 Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
273	Monica	 Yeah?
274	Chandler	 Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
275	Monica	 Ohh, absolutely.
276	Ross	 And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
277	Monica	 Yeah, definitely!
278	Ross	 Okay, (gets up) if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
279	Monica	 Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.
280	Ross	 Man! (Monica mouths, "I’m sorry.")
281	Chandler	 Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.
282		(Ross storms out.)

288	Tag	 I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
289	Rachel	 Oh really?!
290	Tag	 Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
291	Rachel	 Oh, did you not want people to know that?
292	Tag	 But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.
293	Rachel	 Why’s that?
294	Tag	 I don’t think I should say.
295	Rachel	 Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)
296	Tag	 Okay.
297	Rachel	 ‘Kay.
298	Tag	 Well…
