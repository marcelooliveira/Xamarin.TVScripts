2	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are having brunch.]
3	Monica	 Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
4	Rachel	 Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!
5	Phoebe	 I hope it’s you.
6	Rachel	 Me too!
7	Monica	 First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…
8	Rachel	 Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
9	Monica	 Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…
10	Phoebe	 Yes!!! Oh!!
11	Rachel	 Hypothetically!
12	Phoebe	 Still.
13	Monica	 If Phoebe were my maid of honor…
14	Rachel	 Uh-hmm.
15	Monica	 Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
16	Rachel	 Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
17	Phoebe	 Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
18	Monica	 (laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
19	Phoebe	 Wh-why is that the best part?
20	Monica	 Because then I don’t have to!
21	Rachel	 Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…
22	Monica	 I’m really not deciding!
23	Rachel	 Fine!
24		(The woman gets up and walks over to their table.)
25	Woman	 Excuse me, I-I couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying Chandler Bing?
26	Monica	 Yeah that’s right.
27	Woman	 (sarcastically) Huh, good luck!
28	Phoebe	 Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
29		Opening Credits
30	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are finishing watching Die Hard on video.]
31	Chandler	 Die Hard still great!
32	Joey	 Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
33	Chandler	 What’d you rent?
34	Joey	 Die Hard 2.
35	Chandler	 (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
36	Joey	 Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
37	Ross	 Joey, we just saw it!
38	Joey	 And?
39	Ross	 And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
40	Joey and Ross	 Die Hard!!!!!!
41	Ross	 Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
42	Chandler	 Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
43	Ross	 Well, John McClane had plans!
44	Chandler	 No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
45	Joey	 What are you talking about? Bitch.
46	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is bringing Rachel some coffee.]
47	Phoebe	 Hey Rachel?
48	Rachel	 Yeah?
49	Phoebe	 Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
50	Rachel	 Really?!
51	Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.
52	Rachel	 Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
53	Phoebe	 Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…
54	Rachel	 Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
55	Phoebe	 But why does it even matter?!
56	Rachel	 Why does it matter so much to you?!
57	Phoebe	 Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!
58	Rachel	 What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
59	Phoebe	 (gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!
60	Rachel	 Yeah but Phoebe…
61	Phoebe	 And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.
62	Rachel	 Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s maid of honor.
63	Phoebe	 Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
64	Rachel	 I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
65	Phoebe	 Oh I know.
66	Rachel	 Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what isn’t?")
67	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I don’t think Joey and Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And they’re on the same couch. Which means they’re sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasn’t been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. That is unless you’re a Republican in which case that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they should happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me sum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]
68	Ross	 What happened?!!
69	Joey	 Well, I don’t know!!
70	Ross	 We fell asleep! That is all.
71	Joey	 Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.
72	Ross	 I think that would be best.
73	Joey	 Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.
74	Ross	 Okay. But not about this!
75	Joey	 No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross’s hand.) Bye.
76	Ross	 No touch! No touch!
77	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just gotten back from brunch and is telling Chandler about it.]
78	Monica	 Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.
79	Chandler	 That’s sweet.
80	Monica	 No, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
81	Chandler	 So uh, what did this woman look like?
82	Monica	 She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
83	Chandler	 Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
84	Monica	 Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
85	Chandler	 No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
86	Monica	 What are you doing?
87	Chandler	 Well, let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
88	Monica	 Oh my God yes! Who is she?
89	Chandler	 Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
90	Monica	 Did you break up with her?
91	Chandler	 (pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
92	Monica	 Why?
93	Chandler	 Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
94	Monica	 Fat?!
95	Chandler	 I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
96	Monica	 You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
97	Chandler	 Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
98	Monica	 Well, apparently she does.
99	Chandler	 Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
100	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Rachel and Phoebe are already there.]
101	Joey	 Hey! What’s going on?
102	Rachel	 Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
103	Joey	 Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)
104	Rachel	 (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
105	Phoebe	 See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
106	Rachel	 All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
107	Phoebe	 Na-uh, I am!
108	Rachel	 How come you are?!
109	Phoebe	 Because I cared enough to lie!
110	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.
111	Phoebe	 What are you talking about?
112	Joey	 Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
113	Phoebe	 Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
114	Joey	 Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
115	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding.
116	Rachel	 Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
117	Phoebe	 No! Coins hate me!
118	Rachel	 Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
119	Phoebe	 Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
120	Ross	 Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
121	Joey	 Hi.
122	Ross	 Just uh, brought back your videos.
123	Joey	 Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
124	Ross	 No! No we don’t!
125	Joey	 Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
126	Ross	 I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
127	Joey	 Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
128	Ross	 I’ve had better.
129	Joey	 Okay! When?!
130	Ross	 All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
131	Joey	 Uh-huh!
132	Ross	 I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
133	Joey	 I want to do it again.
134	Ross	 We can’t do it again.
135	Joey	 Why not?
136	Ross	 Because it’s weird!
137	Joey	 Fine! Do you want something to drink?
138	Ross	 Sure, what do you got?
139	Joey	 Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
140		Commercial Break
141	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is approaching the bathroom door behind which Chandler is using the facility.]
142	Monica	 Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
143	Chandler	 Can you figure out what I’m doing?
144	Monica	 You’re Lewis Posin.
145	Chandler	 Who?
146	Monica	 Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
147	Chandler	 Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
148	Monica	 No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
149	Chandler	 What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
150	Monica	 No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
151	Chandler	 Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!
152	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]
153	Joey	 Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
154	Ross	 No, 10 is the highest.
155	Joey	 Why is 10 the highest?
156	Ross	 Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1
157	Joey	 (crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!
158	Rachel	 Okay, uh…
159	Joey	 I’ve got cold feet.
160	Rachel	 …it’s gonna be okay!
161	Joey	 No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!
162	Rachel	 Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
163	Joey	 (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
164	Rachel	 Thanks!
165	Ross	 Yes, very nice Rachel.
166	Rachel	 Thank you judges.
167	Phoebe	 Ugh, what a kiss ass.
168	Rachel	 Oh!
169	Joey	 Okay, Phoebe…
170	Phoebe	 Yes! Your honor?
171	Joey	 We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
172	Ross	 (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
173	Phoebe	 Oh!
174	Joey	 Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
175	Rachel	 Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
176	Phoebe	 Hey! Do you want, do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
177	Ross	 It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
178	Rachel	 Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…
179	Ross	 Go!
180	Rachel	 Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six-year-olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six-year-old.
181	Ross and Joey	 Oh! That’s nice.
182	Rachel	 Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
183	Joey	 Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
184	Ross	 Yeah, it really was!
185	Rachel	 Aw, thanks!
186	Ross	 Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really don’t see the point.
187	Joey	 Yeah.
188	Phoebe	 Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this today with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)
189		(Joey and Ross pause while they picture the event.)
190	Joey	 And she’s back in the game.
191	[Scene	 A random apartment building, Chandler and Monica are knocking on the door of the woman from the beginning.]
192	Chandler	 (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
193	Julie	 Hello Skidmark.
194	Chandler	 (To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.
195	Monica	 It’s pretty clear.
196	Chandler	 Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
197	Julie	 That’s why you broke up with me?
198	Chandler	 You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!
199	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their election. Somewhat faster than Florida I might add.]
200	Joey	 All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!
201	Phoebe	 Really?! I won!
202	Rachel	 What?!
203	Ross	 I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
204	Rachel	 Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard that before.)
205	Ross	 Actually, it wasn’t that close.
206	Rachel	 No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
207	Phoebe	 The coins have finally forgiven me!
208	Rachel	 Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
209	Phoebe	 (running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!
210	Joey	 Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
211	Ross	 Yeah?
212	Joey	 Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)
213	Ross	 Why-why would I care about that?
214	Joey	 No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.
215		(Joey gets up and heads for the door. After a pause Ross decides to join him.)
216	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from Julie’s.]
217	Chandler	 As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
218	Monica	 Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.
219	Chandler	 I would really love it if I could do both.
220	Monica	 All right, I…I have to ask.
221	Chandler	 What?
222	Monica	 Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
223	Chandler	 What?!
224	Monica	 Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
225	Chandler	 A hundred and forty-five pounds.
226	Monica	 In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.
227	Chandler	 Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
228	Monica	 Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
229	Chandler	 Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
230	Monica	 How?
231	Chandler	 You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
232	Monica	 What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!
233	Chandler	 Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
234	Monica	 Keep going.
235	Chandler	 So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
236	Monica	 Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
237	Chandler	 I’d carry you around in my pocket.
238	Monica	 I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
239	Chandler	 Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
240	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]
241	Rachel	 Hi Pheebs.
242	Phoebe	 Hi!
243	Rachel	 Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
244	Phoebe	 That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.
245	Rachel	 Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
246	Phoebe	 Oh yeah!
247	Rachel	 Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…
248	Phoebe	 Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
249	Rachel	 Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
250	Phoebe	 Ohh.
251	Rachel	 And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.
252	Phoebe	 This stuff is great!
253	Rachel	 Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…
254	Phoebe	 Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s maid of honor.
255	Rachel	 You do? Why?
256	Phoebe	 Because I think it means more to you.
257	Rachel	 But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.
258	Phoebe	 It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)
259	Rachel	 No, I was ten. I just developed early.
260	Phoebe	 (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
261	Monica	 (entering) Hey, what’s going on?
262	Rachel	 Hey!
263	Phoebe	 Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
264	Monica	 (gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6
265	Rachel	 Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
266		Ending Credits
267	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are napping together again and both wake up at the same time.]
268	Joey	 Great nap.
269	Ross	 It really was.
270		(Suddenly Rachel clears her throat and the camera cuts to the rest of the gang staring at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the gang.)
271	Joey	 (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
272	Ross	 (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
273		End
