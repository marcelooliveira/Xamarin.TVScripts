3	[Scene	 Central Perk, the whole gang is there including Janice.]
4	Janice	 Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
5	Phoebe	 Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.
6	Ross	 I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
7	Janice	 Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
8	Joey	 Well, that’s really a different question.
9	Janice	 I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
10	Joey	 Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
11	Monica and Rachel	 What?!!
12	Rachel	 Excuse me, there was no time!
13	Joey	 Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?
14	Janice	 Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
15	Rachel	 Does anybody need more coffee?
16	Ross	 Yeah, I’ll take some.
17	Joey	 Hey, there’s a dog out there!
18		Opening Credits
19	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe’s, three years earlier, Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are there]
20	Phoebe	 Oh, that is so unfortunate.
21	Ross	 What?
22	Phoebe	 Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
23	Monica	 (entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
24	Phoebe	 You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
25	Monica	 Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)
26	Phoebe	 (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out.
27	Ross	 Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
28	Phoebe	 I think on some levels she already knows.
29	Ross	 Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
30	Phoebe	 Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
31	Chandler	 (entering, with a goatee) Hey.
32	Ross	 Hey.
33	Chandler	 I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.
34	Phoebe	 Why, nobody good?
35	Chandler	 Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
36	Ross	 So how many more do you have tomorrow?
37	Chandler	 Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’
38	Monica	 (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!
39	Ross	 (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
40	Monica	 What?
41	Ross	 I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
42	Chandler	 Umm, how’s it going with you guys?
43	Ross	 Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
44	Phoebe	 Oh, really?
45	Ross	 Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference
46	[Scene	 Chandler’s, Chandler is interviewing a potential roommate.]
47	Chandler	 Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
48	Eric	 Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool.
49	Chandler	 Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
50	Eric	 Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)
51	Chandler	 Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)
52	[Scene	 Chandler’s, Chandler is interviewing Joey.]
53	Chandler	 (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye.

55	Chandler	 Sure. Ummm. What’s up?
56	Joey	 Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.
57	Chandler	 What gay thing?
58	Joey	 Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.

65	[Scene	 A bar, Chandler is entering.]
66	Chandler	 Hey, Mon.
67	Monica	 Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
68	Chandler	 Do I ever.
69	Monica	 Chris says they’re closing down the bar.
70	Chandler	 No way!
71	Monica	 Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.
72	Chandler	 Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
73	Monica	 Got me.
74	Chandler	 (to bartender) Can I get a beer.
75	Monica	 Hey, did you pick a roommate?
76	Chandler	 You betcha!
77	Monica	 Is it the Italian guy?
78	Chandler	 Um-mm, yeah right!
79	Monica	 He’s so cute.
80	Chandler	 Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
81	Monica	 Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
82	Chandler	 Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.
83	Rachel	 (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.
84	Waitress	 I am so sorry.
85	Rachel	 That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
86	Friend No. 1	 Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
87	Rachel	 Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)
88	Friend No. 2	 Oh, isn’t it exciting, I mean it’s like having a boyfriend for life.
89	Rachel	 Yeah, I know.
90	Friend No. 1	 What?
91	Rachel	 Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)
92	Friend No. 1	 Rachel stop!
93	Friend No. 2	 You’re so bad!
94	Rachel	 I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
95		(Chandler throws the cue ball under there table.)
96	Chandler	 Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
97	Rachel	 Yeah, so?
98	Chandler	 (picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)
99	Monica	 Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!

106	Rachel	 Oh, but that’s okay.
107	Monica	 I know.
108	Rachel	 Yeah.
109		(An awkward silence)
110	Monica	 So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.
111	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city?
112	Monica	 Oh, that’d be great.
113	Rachel	 Okay!
114	Monica	 Thanks.
115	Rachel	 Bye!
116	Monica	 Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
117	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe’s, Ross is on the phone, as Phoebe is walking by carrying a lamp.]
118	Ross	 No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
119	Phoebe	 So what are they doing?
120	Ross	 I don’t know, something girlie.
121	Phoebe	 (to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early.
122	Monica	 What are you doing with the lamp?
123	Phoebe	 I’m just taking it to be re-wired.
124	Monica	 Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.
125		(There is a knock on the door, Phoebe answers it, its Mr. Heckles)
126	Phoebe	 No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
127	Mr. Heckles	 You’re disturbing my oboe practice.
128	Phoebe	 You don’t play the oboe!
129	Mr. Heckles	 I could play the oboe!
130	Phoebe	 Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.)
131		(in the hallway, Eric is moving in)
132	Mr. Heckles	 (to Eric) Who are you?
133	Eric	 Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate.
134	Mr. Heckles	 I’m Chandler’s new roommate.
135	Eric	 I-I-I don’t think so.
136	Mr. Heckles	 I could be Chandler’s new roommate.
137	Eric	 But, he told me over the phone.
138	Mr. Heckles	 He told me in person.
139	Eric	 That’s weird.
140	Mr. Heckles	 Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to the door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)
141		(inside Chandler’s apartment, Chandler is coming in from his bedroom, sees Mr. Heckles, and screams.)
142	[Scene	 the hallway, Joey is moving in, Monica is leaving.]
143	Monica	 Hi, again.
144	Joey	 Hey! (goes into the apartment)
145	Chandler	 (leaving to go to work) Hey!
146	Monica	 Thank you soo, much.
147	Chandler	 Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
148		(Joey comes back into the hallway and starts to pick up a heavy box)
149	Monica	 You want some help with that?
150	Joey	 Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!
151	Monica	 Whoa! Are you okay?
152	Joey	 Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
153	Monica	 It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) And-and the humidity.
154	Joey	 That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.
155	Monica	 Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
156	Joey	 Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is a great place.
157	Monica	 Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
158	Joey	 Gotcha.
159	Monica	 This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
160	Joey	 Oh, you bet I am!
161	Monica	 (turning around) Okay, here’s your penis!
162		Commercial Break
163	[Scene	 continued from earlier.]
164	Monica	 Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
165	Joey	 You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
166	Monica	 So?!
167	Joey	 Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
168	Monica	 Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
169	Joey	 Oh right, right.
170	Monica	 I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
171	Joey	 Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.
172	Monica	 It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
173	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe’s, Monica is vacuuming.]
174	Monica	 Pheebs?
175	Phoebe	 Huh?
176	Monica	 Where’s your bed?
177	Phoebe	 It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’ look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.
178	Monica	 What?
179	Phoebe	 Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.
180	Monica	 What are you talking about?
181	Phoebe	 I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
182	Monica	 Everybody knows!
183	Phoebe	 That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
184	Monica	 Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
185	Phoebe	 Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
186	Monica	 What?!?!
187	Phoebe	 Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
188	Monica	 You can spill. In the sink.
189	Phoebe	 Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.
190	Monica	 I love you, too.
191	Phoebe	 Aww, good. (they hug) What?
192	Monica	 What? I’m just said.
193	Phoebe	 No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.
194	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, (now) Joey is watching Baywatch, as Chandler enters from his bedroom.]
195	Chandler	 So ah, whatcha watching?
196	Joey	 Baywatch.
197	Chandler	 What’s it about?
198	Joey	 Lifeguards.
199	Chandler	 Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?
200	Joey	 Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
201		(Baywatch goes into one of those running scenes.)
202	Chandler	 Wow! Look at them run.
203	Joey	 They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
204	Chandler	 Yeah, I’ll go get one.
205	Joey	 No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.
206	[Scene	 Monica’s, Monica is coming out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel, as Chandler is entering.]
207	Chandler	 Well, hello!
208	Monica	 Hey.
209	Chandler	 Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
210	Monica	 (all depressed) Help yourself.
211	Chandler	 You okay?
212	Monica	 Phoebe moved out.
213	Chandler	 Right.
214	Monica	 I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?
215	Chandler	 Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
216	Monica	 Well, I think so.
217	Chandler	 Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.
218	[Scene	 the bar, Ross is entering, Phoebe is at the bar, they are the only two in the place.]
219	Ross	 (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
220	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
221	Ross	 My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
222	Phoebe	 Oh no! Why?
223	Ross	 ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
224	Phoebe	 Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
225	Ross	 (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!
226	Phoebe	 Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
227	Ross	 Well, now I do!!
228	Phoebe	 I’m sorry.
229	Ross	 Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....
230	Phoebe	 Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)
231	[Scene	 Monica’s, Chandler and Monica are still hugging each other.]
232	Chandler	 Umm, this is nice.
233	Monica	 I know, it is isn’t it?
234	Chandler	 No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
235	Monica	 Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
236	Chandler	 Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
237	Monica	 Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
238	Chandler	 Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be....
239	Monica	 I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
240	[Scene	 the bar, Phoebe is still hugging Ross.]
241	Ross	 Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
242	Phoebe	 I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)
243	Ross	 Thanks.
244	Phoebe	 And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And you’re kind (kisses him on the lips)
245	Ross	 Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
246		(They pause, and they the start kissing passionately, and taking off each others clothes, and they start to lie down on the pool table.)
247	Ross	 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
248	Phoebe	 Huh?
249		(Ross tries to clear off the pool table by knocking the balls to the other end of the table, but they all bounce back, and he frantically starts to throw them into the pockets.)
250	Phoebe	 Okay, it’s okay.
251		(Phoebe jumps on to the table and lays down, Ross follows her and hits his head on the light hanging over the pool table.)
252	Phoebe	 Oh. (they start kissing again)
253	Ross	 Wait, wait, wait.
254	Phoebe	 What?
255	Ross	 My foot is stuck in the pocket.
256	Phoebe	 What?
257	Ross	 No, I can’t get it out.
258	Phoebe	 Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.
259	Ross	 No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
260	Phoebe	 What?
261	Ross	 Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
262		(They both look at each other and start laughing (Lisa almost lost it there), and sit up. Ross hits his head on the lamp again.)
263	Ross	 Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
264	Phoebe	 You have chalk on your face.
265	Ross	 Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
266	Phoebe	 Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.
267	Monica	 Hey, are you okay?
268	Ross	 My wife’s a lesbian.
269	Joey	 Cool!!
270	Chandler	 Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)
271	Ross	 Hi.
