4	Phoebe	 Well, I left my guitar here again.
5	Monica	 Oh, okay. No problem.

7	Monica	 Okay.
8	Phoebe	 Oh.
9	Monica	 Here you go.
10	Phoebe	 Okay.
11	Monica	 Okay.
12	Phoebe	 Great! Umm…(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)
13	Monica	 What?!
14	Phoebe	 So do you want to hang out or something?
15	Monica	 Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
16	Phoebe	 Oh are you and Chandler…
17	Monica	 Yes! Exactly.
18	Phoebe	 Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
19	Monica	 (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
20	Chandler	 Hey Pheebs, what’s up?
21	Phoebe	 You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
22		(Chandler lets her into the apartment and reveals that Monica is getting a massage from another woman.)
23	Phoebe	 Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
24	Monica	 Phoebe, I can explain!
25	Phoebe	 You told me you hate massages!
26	Chandler	 Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.
27	Phoebe	 I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?
28	Monica	 Well umm, Alexandra has been…
29	Phoebe	 Oh, it has a name?

31	Phoebe	 Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go! (She storms out.)

34	[Scene	 Joey’s Bedroom, Joey is having a dream about Rachel giving birth with him as the father.]
35	Joey	 Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re almost there! We’re almost there!
36	Rachel	 Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.
37	Joey	 Oh, I love you too.
38	Rachel	 And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you’re the best sex I ever had.
39	Joey	 That’s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
40		(Finally, the baby is delivered and starts crying.)
41	Doctor	 Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
42		(She hands the baby to Joey who pulls down the blanket to reveal Ross’s face where the baby’s should be.)
43	Ross	 (crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
44	Rachel	 (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
45	Joey	 What? What’s going on?
46	Rachel	 Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
47	Joey	 Aaaah…
48	Rachel	 Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
49	Joey	 Really?!
50	Rachel	 Yes!
51		(Joey starts to get up but stops.)
52	Joey	 Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a not, I’m not wearing any bottoms.
53	Rachel	 Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
54	Joey	 Oh my, oh my God!
55	Rachel	 Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
56	Joey	 Mia Hamm?
57	Rachel	 Mia Hamm!
58	Joey	 Oh that’s amazing. (Drops the sheet.)
59	Rachel	 (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
60	Joey	 Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
61	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica has opened another wedding present as Chandler enters.]
62	Chandler	 Hey babe.
63	Monica	 Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
64	Chandler	 Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
65	Monica	 No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?
66	Chandler	 How about to the street say from the balcony?
67	Monica	 Why don’t we just find a place for it?
68	Chandler	 Okay. How about in that cabinet?
69	Monica	 No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
70	Chandler	 How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)
71	Monica	 Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?
72	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
73	Monica	 No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
74	Chandler	 Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
75	Monica	 Feminine stuff.
76	Chandler	 Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
77	Monica	 Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.
78	Chandler	 Fine.
79	Monica	 Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
80	Chandler	 (walking casually away) Love you.
81	Phoebe	 (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
82	Chandler	 Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, "If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
83	Phoebe	 Why won’t you let me massage you?
84	Monica	 Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.
85	Phoebe	 Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
86	Monica	 That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!
87	Phoebe	 I’m curious about the human body.
88	Monica	 Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
89	Phoebe	 But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
90	Monica	 Okay, if it means that much to you…
91	Phoebe	 It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.
92	Monica	 Dinosaurs.
93	Phoebe	 Potato, potaato.
94	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Rachel are there as Ross enters.]
95	Ross	 Hey!
96	Joey	 Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
97	Ross	 What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel’s belly.)
98	Rachel	 It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.
99	Ross	 Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
100	Rachel	 Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…
101	Joey	 A dreamless sleep.
102	Ross	 My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
103	Joey	 Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
104	Ross	 Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
105	Joey	 Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
106	[Scene	 Phoebe's Apartment, Monica is lying on the massage table waiting for Phoebe.]
107	Phoebe	 (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
108	Monica	 Yes.
109		(Phoebe turns on some music and grabs some oil.)
110	Phoebe	 (in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.) How’s the pressure?
111	Monica	 Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
112	Phoebe	 Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.
113	Monica	 No. Ooohh…
114	Phoebe	 That’s right, you just enjoy.
115	Monica	 (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
116	Phoebe	 (getting uncomfortable) Okay.
117	Monica	 Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’s it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
118	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler has a box of keys and is trying them on the secret closet when someone enters.]
119	Chandler	 I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
120	Joey	 Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
121	Chandler	 Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.
122	Joey	 Why not?
123	Chandler	 I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!
124	Joey	 I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.
125	Chandler	 Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
126	Joey	 Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
127	Chandler	 And here we go…
128	Joey	 I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!
129	Rachel	 Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)
130	Joey	 Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
131	Rachel	 Really?
132	Joey	 Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.
133	Rachel	 Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!
134	Joey	 Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing bones!
135	[Scene	 The Hospital, Joey is in the waiting room as Rachel comes back out with the doctor.]
136	Joey	 Hey! So?
137	Dr. Long	 She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
138	Rachel	 Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?
139	Joey	 So but everything is normal.
140	Dr. Long	 Absolutely.
141	Joey	 And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?
142	Dr. Long	 No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what they are, but she’s fine.
143	Rachel	 Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
144	Joey	 Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!
145	Rachel	 But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
146	Joey	 Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!
147	Rachel	 But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
148	Joey	 You sure?!
149	Rachel	 Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?
150	Joey	 (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
151	Ross	 (rushes in) Is everything okay?
152	Rachel	 Yeah, everything’s fine!
153	Ross	 Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
154	Joey	 Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
155	Ross	 Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.
156	Rachel	 Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
157	Joey	 Hey uh, what’s with the candy?
158	Ross	 Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
159	Rachel	 Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
160	Ross	 No I—Mona!
161	Rachel	 Oh, I gotta go back in there.
162	Ross	 What? Why? What’s wrong?
163	Rachel	 No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…
164	Ross	 No really, you tell me what’s up.
165	Rachel	 I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
166	Ross	 (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
167	Joey	 Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.
168	Ross	 Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
169	Dr. Long	 (To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, here’s some information on Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You’re gonna make a wonderful father.
170	Joey	 Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He brought Twizlers!
171		Commercial Break
172	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Joey and Chandler are still working on the door.]
173	Chandler	 There has got to be a way!
174	Joey	 Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
175	Chandler	 Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.
176	Joey	 Then why do you throw like one?
177	Chandler	 Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
178	Joey	 Sure. "Monica."
179	Chandler	 So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
180	Joey	 Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way about Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
181	Chandler	 That’s a good idea.
182	Joey	 Yeah.
183	Chandler	 Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
184	Joey	 Oh, I just…I feel terrible.
185	Chandler	 Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?
186	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch as Monica enters.]
187	Monica	 Hey.
188	Phoebe	 Hey.
189	Monica	 I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
190	Phoebe	 No-no, I got that.
191	Monica	 So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
192	Phoebe	 Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.
193	Monica	 Okay.
194	Phoebe	 I mean $500.
195	Monica	 What?
196	Phoebe	 600.
197	Monica	 What’s going on?
198	Phoebe	 Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
199	Monica	 What? (Laughs.)
200	Phoebe	 Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
201	Monica	 What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!
202	Phoebe	 Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.
203	Monica	 Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!
204	Phoebe	 No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
205	Monica	 Really?!
206	Phoebe	 Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.
207	Monica	 Are you sure?
208	Phoebe	 Yes.
209	Monica	 I guess.
210	Phoebe	 Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you hear something you liked?
211	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is balancing an aluminum can on her stomach as Ross enters.]
212	Rachel	 Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
213	Ross	 Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
214	Rachel	 Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?
215	Ross	 Well yeah!
216	Rachel	 Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
217	Ross	 What?! What?! Rach what?!
218	Joey	 What’s going on?
219	Ross	 I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
220	Joey	 Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
221	Ross	 (to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?
222	Rachel	 Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
223	Joey	 I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
224	Ross	 I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!
225	Joey	 Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
226	Ross	 Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.
227	Rachel	 (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
228	Joey	 Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
229	Ross	 Yeah.
230	Rachel	 What’s up?
231	Joey	 Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
232	Rachel	 (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
233	Joey	 The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…
234	Rachel	 Yeah?
235	Joey	 Maybe you two should live together.
236	Rachel	 Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
237	Joey	 Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.
238	Rachel	 But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or he does.
239	Ross	 No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
240	Rachel	 But Ross, its you and me!
241	Ross	 So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
242	Joey	 All right now, so? What do you think?
243	Rachel	 I don’t know. Is it crazy?
244	Ross	 No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
245	Joey	 Well, I was due.
246	Rachel	 Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.
247	Ross	 Really?
248	Rachel	 Yeah.
249	Ross	 Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
250	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is pounding out the hinge pins on the closet door to get it open.]
251	Chandler	 Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!
252	Monica	 (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
253	Chandler	 (laughs) You’re messy.
254	Monica	 Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!
255	Chandler	 I married Fred Sanford!
256	Monica	 No Chandler, you don’t understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.
257	Chandler	 No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.
258	Monica	 Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?
259	Chandler	 Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
260	Monica	 Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.
261	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is drinking a gallon of orange juice as Chandler enters.]
262	Chandler	 Hey.
263	Joey	 Hey.
264	Chandler	 So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
265	Joey	 Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.
266	Chandler	 Are you okay?
267	Joey	 Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
