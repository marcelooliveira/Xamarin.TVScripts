2	Joey	 (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode) Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.
3		[cut to Phoebe Sr.’s house, from the last episode]
4	Phoebe Sr.	 (to Phoebe) I’m your mother.
5	Phoebe	 Ehh?
6		[cut to Monica opening the door of the beach house, with Chandler trying to pick her up for a date.]
7	Joey	 (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...
8	Chandler	 (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)
9	Joey	 (voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either.
10		[cut to a montage of scenes involving Bonnie, Ross, and Rachel from the last episode.]
11	Joey	 (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either...
12		[cut back to Joey on the beach towel]
13	Joey	 Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)
14	[Scene	 The beach house, it’s the same scene from the end of last year, with Ross in front of the two doors of Rachel’s and Bonnie’s rooms, trying to decide which door to choose. He finally chooses the one his right and goes in.]
15	Ross	 (surprised) Hi!
16	Rachel and Bonnie	 Hi!
17	Bonnie	 Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
18	Ross	 Awww.
19	Bonnie	 (to Rachel) Thanks a million.
20	Rachel	 Oh, you’re welcome a million.
21	Bonnie	 (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I’ll see you in our room.
22	Ross	 Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
23	Rachel	 (softly) Oh my God.
24	Ross	 I know.
25		(They both kiss again and fall onto the bed.)
26	Ross	 (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
27	Rachel	 Whoa! What?! Why?!
28	Ross	 Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
29	Rachel	 Here?! Now?!
30	Ross	 Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.
31	Rachel	 Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?
32	Ross	 No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
33	Rachel	 (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
34	Ross	 Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
35	Rachel	 I don’t know.
36		(they kiss again)
37	Ross	 Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.
38	Rachel	 Oh, making it worse!
39	Ross	 Okay.
40		Opening Credits
41	[Scene	 Phoebe Sr.’s house, it’s right after she told Phoebe that she’s her birth mother.]
42	Phoebe Sr.	 So I guess you’d like to know how it all happened.
43	Phoebe	 I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
44	Phoebe Sr.	 Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
45	Phoebe	 How close?
46	Phoebe Sr.	 Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
47	Phoebe	 I don’t even know how that would work!
48	Phoebe Sr.	 Well, we were...
49	Phoebe	 (interrupting) I’m not asking!
50	Phoebe Sr.	 Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old?
51	Phoebe	 Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
52	Phoebe Sr.	 Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
53	Phoebe	 Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.
54	Phoebe Sr.	 Wait!
55	Phoebe	 I don’t ever want to see you again!
56		(She walks out and slams the door.)
57	Phoebe	 (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my purse?
58	[Scene	 The beach house, Joey and Chandler are sitting at the dinner table, Monica is looking in the fridge.]
59	Monica	 (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.
60	Chandler	 (jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.
61	Monica	 Really?!
62	Chandler	 Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
63	Phoebe	 Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
64		(The gang is shocked.)
65	Chandler	 I found a dried up seashores.
66	Monica	 Sweety, what are you talking about?
67	Phoebe	 Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)
68	Joey	 Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?
69	Phoebe	 No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
70		(She starts to go upstairs.)
71	Phoebe	 (turning around, insistently) Monica!
72	Monica	 Oh.
73	[Scene	 The beach house, Rachel’s bedroom. She is finishing up writing something as Ross walks through the door.]
74	Ross	 It’s over.
75	Rachel	 Oh, was it awful?
76	Ross	 Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
77		(They kiss.)
78	Rachel	 I wrote you a letter.
79	Ross	 Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)
80	Rachel	 (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
81	Ross	 Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5
82	Rachel	 Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.
83	Ross	 Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
84	[Scene	 The beach house, the next morning. Ross is passed out on the kitchen counter. He wakes up with a start and has one of the pages of the letter stuck to his face.]
85	Ross	 Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)
86	Rachel	 (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
87	Ross	 Done!
88	Rachel	 You just finished?
89	Ross	 Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
90	Rachel	 So umm, does it?
91	Ross	 I’m sorry.
92	Rachel	 Does it?
93	Ross	 Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.
94	Rachel	 What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...
95	Ross	 (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.
96		(Rachel stands there for a moment, starting to cry. Then gasps and runs over and hugs him. While hugging her, Ross tries to find the ‘Does it?’ part in the letter.)
97	Rachel	 Are you sure?
98	Ross	 Oh, sure! I’m sure.
99	Rachel	 I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)
100	[Scene	 The beach. Chandler and Monica are out getting some sun.]
101	Chandler	 All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
102	Monica	 Ennnh.
103	Chandler	 I’ve got canned goods.
104	Joey	 (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
105	Chandler	 Excellent hole, Joe.
106		(A wave crashes on the beach and partially fills up his hole.)
107	Joey	 Oh no! No!! My hole!!
108	Monica	 (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
109	Joey	 (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
110	Monica	 Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
111	Chandler	 Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
112	Monica	 It’s like two miles!
113	Joey	 Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.
114	Monica	 Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
115	Chandler	 We’ve got to do something!
116	Joey	 Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.
117	Monica	 What?! What is it?!
118	Joey	 You’re gonna have to pee on it.
119	Monica	 What?!! Gross!!
120	Joey	 Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
121	Chandler	 Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
122	Monica	 Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
123	Joey	 If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
124	[Scene	 The beach house, Phoebe is coming down the stairs all packed and ready to go.]
125	Phoebe	 Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay! Ohh.
126		(The rest of the gang arrives with their heads down in shame.)
127	Ross	 Hey!
128	Rachel	 How was the beach?
129	Monica	 Nothing, I don’t know.
130	Ross	 What happened?
131	Monica	 Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.
132	Chandler	 Me too!!
133	Joey	 Me too.
134	Phoebe	 Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.
135	Rachel	 Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
136	Ross	 It does. It really and truly does.
137		(Rachel kisses him, and goes upstairs. After she’s gone, Ross frantically tries to find and read the ‘Does it?’ part.)
138	Ross	 (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
139		Commercial Break
140	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler about the letter.]
141	Ross	 She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
142	Chandler	 Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!
143	Ross	 Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”
144	Joey	 No?
145	Chandler	 Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
146	Ross	 (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
147	Joey	 Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.
148	Ross	 What the hell happened on that beach?!
149	Joey	 It’s between us and the sea, Ross!
150		(Ross laughs and has a ‘Come on...’ look on his face as he looks and Chandler who nods his head in agreement with Joey. Ross is stunned.)
151	[Scene	 A hallway in an apartment building. Phoebe is knocks on a door and it opens.]
152	Phoebe	 (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.
153	Ursula	 Hey!
154	Phoebe	 Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
155	Ursula	 Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
156	Phoebe	 (shocked) You know her?!
157	Ursula	 No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note.
158	Phoebe	 There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do you still have it?
159	Ursula	 (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in Phoebe’s face.)
160	Phoebe	 I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!
161	Ursula	 Yeah. So how have you been doing?
162	Phoebe	 I, umm, shut up!
163		(Ursula opens the door and hands her the note.)
164	Phoebe	 (reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!
165	Ursula	 Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
166	Phoebe	 Noooo!!
167	Ursula	 All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment and slams the door shut.)
168	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are sitting at the table eating dinner and not talking. Ross and Rachel are outside cuddling on the balcony.]
169	Monica	 Pass the cheese, please.
170		(Joey hands her the cheese without looking at her.)
171	Monica	 My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?
172	Joey	 Nope.
173		(Phoebe enters.)
174	Chandler	 (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
175	Phoebe	 No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
176	Chandler	 I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
177	Ross	 (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
178	Chandler, Monica, and Joey	 NO!!!
179	Rachel	 All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?
180	Monica	 What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
181	Ross and Rachel	 Come on!
182	Ross	 What happened? Joey?
183	Joey	 All right. (gets up)
184	Monica	 (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!
185	Chandler	 (running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!
186	Joey	 Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
187	Monica	 (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.
188	Chandler	 (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
189	Monica	 I was in too much pain.
190	Joey	 And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
191	Chandler	 And then Joey remembered something.
192	Joey	 I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
193	Ross	 Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
194	Phoebe and Rachel	 Ewwww!!
195	Monica	 You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)
196	Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel	 (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
197	Joey	 That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
198	Chandler	 (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
199	Joey	 (laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
200	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is finishing up a song.]
201	Phoebe	 (singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.
202	Phoebe Sr.	 I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up.
203	Phoebe	 Okay, bye.
204	Phoebe Sr.	 No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know, start from here?
205	Phoebe	 No.
206	Phoebe Sr.	 Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I’m family, I’m it. Now, now I’m done. (starts to leave)
207	Phoebe	 But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?
208	Phoebe Sr.	 Yeah, I guess you’re right.
209	Phoebe	 It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
210	Phoebe Sr.	 Well, I don’t know. I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
211	Phoebe	 I-I like pizza!
212	Phoebe Sr.	 You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
213	Phoebe	 Oh my God, so do I!
214	Phoebe Sr.	 I knew it, wow!!
215	Phoebe	 Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
216	Phoebe Sr.	 Ohh, so cute.
217	Phoebe	 Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.
218	Phoebe Sr.	 I know. I’m mad at me too.
219	Phoebe	 Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.
220	Phoebe Sr.	 Hey! Me too!
221	Phoebe	 All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.
222	[Scene	 Rachel’s bedroom. Ross and Rachel have just finished consummating the new relationship.]
223	Rachel	 Oh-hooo, I missed you.
224	Ross	 I missed you too.
225	Rachel	 Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?
226	Ross	 (getting miffed) I suppose.
227	Rachel	 You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”
228	Ross	 (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
229	Rachel	 Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
230		[cut to Monica cleaning the floor in the kitchen]
231	Ross	 (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
232	Chandler	 (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
233	Monica	 You bet.
234		[cut back to Rachel’s bedroom with both of them hurriedly getting dressed]
235	Ross	 And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
236	Rachel	 Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
237	Ross	 I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
238	Rachel	 What?!!
239	Ross	 I fell asleep!
240	Rachel	 You fell asleep?!
241	Ross	 It was 5
242	Rachel	 Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
243	Ross	 (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
244	Rachel	 Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
245	Monica	 Hey!!
246	Rachel	 (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!
247	Ross	 Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
248	Rachel	 And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
249	Chandler	 I KNEW IT!!!!

254	Monica	 Will you stop!
255	Chandler	 Okay. All right.
