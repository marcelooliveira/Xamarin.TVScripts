4	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.
5	Rachel	 What’s Flimby’s?
6	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.
7	Rachel	 Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!
8	Phoebe	 No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!
9	Chandler	 Ye-e-es!!
10	Joey	 (entering) Hey.

15	Joey	 Two it is. Ross, how about you?
16	Ross	 Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
17	Monica	 Really? Who’s number two?
18	Chandler	 Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
19	Ross	 Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.
20	Phoebe	 Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
21	Ross	 Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?
22	Rachel	 No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…
23	Joey	 But you said one.
24	Rachel	 I meant, me plus one!
25	Joey	 Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
26	Ross	 All right, I’ll see you tonight.
27	Joey	 Okay.
28	Rachel	 Okay, bye-bye!

33	Joey	 Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
34	All	 Oh!
35	Joey	 (to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
36	Monica	 Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.
37	Chandler	 Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.
38	Joey	 The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
39	Chandler	 Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
40		(In horror, Joey wipes his neck and smells it.)

46	Phoebe	 Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…
47	Monica	 Phoebe?
48	Phoebe	 What?! Monica, I’m scared!!
49	Monica	 All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?
50	Phoebe	 Yeah.

52	Hold Voice	 Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
53	Monica	 Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.
54		(Phoebe starts to hang up the phone, but…)
55	Hold Voice	 Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.

64	Ross	 Hi!
65	Rachel	 How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)

68	Ross	 So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.
69	Rachel	 Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!

72	Rachel	 Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
73	Tommy	 Hey.
74	Ross	 Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin.
75		(They all try and shake hands at once. They end up criss-crossing they’re arms to shake each other’s hand, and Ross says…)
76	Ross	 And! Break!!
77		(Awkward laughter follows.)
78	Rachel	 Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.
79	Tommy	 Okay.
80	Cailin	 I’ll join you.
81	Tommy	 I’ll get our seats.

85	Tommy	 Oh, I didn’t, I didn’t know that.
86	Ross	 Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…
87	Tommy	 I think we’re here.
88	Ross	 Oh! Yeah.
89	Tommy	 Yeah.
90	Ross	 Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
91	Man	 Umm, no, I don’t think so.
92	Tommy	 Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
93	Man	 Sure. (Hands him the ticket.)
94	Ross	 (looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…
95	Man	 Oh, well I thought that ah…
96	Tommy	 Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn’t really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you’re surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
97	Man	 Uh, the usher told us to come…
98	Tommy	 Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! (They start to leave.) Here! (He throws him back his ticket.) (to Ross, calmly) Hey man, you want the aisle?
99	Ross	 No, I’m good. (He sits down, stunned.)
100	[Scene	 The Theatre, at the post premiere party. The gang is already there, except Phoebe. Joey runs in.]
101	Chandler	 (seeing Joey) There he is!
102	Monica	 There’s our star!
103	Joey	 So, so, what’d ya think?
104	Chandler	 Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
105	Joey	 I-I wasn’t in that.
106	Chandler	 I know.
107	Joey	 (sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
108	Monica	 Hi!
109	The Director	 (stepping in) Excuse me. Excuse me. (to Kate) Sweetheart! (Kisses her.) Come! (They leave.)
110	Chandler	 So that’s the girl you like.
111	Joey	 Yeah.
112	Ross	 (drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s baaad news!
113	Chandler	 Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.
114		[cut to Joey, Rachel, and Tommy.]
115	Joey	 Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.
116	Rachel	 Oh, hi!
117	Lauren	 Hey.
118	Rachel	 Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
119	Lauren	 Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
120		[cut to Monica, Pete, and Cailin]
121	Cailin	 So. How’d you guys meet?
122	Pete	 Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
123	Monica	 Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
124		[cut to Joey as Estelle, Joey’s agent, approaches]
125	Estelle	 Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
126	Joey	 Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
127	Estelle	 How do you do. (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! (to Joey) Did they have representation?
128	Joey	 No, they-they weren’t in the play.
129	Rachel	 We’re not actors.
130	Estelle	 Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.
131	Chandler	 Could I borrow it?
132		[cut to later]
133	Cailin	 (to Ross) Hi! Remember me?
134	Ross	 Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)
135	Cailin	 Ross, I’m gonna go.
136	Ross	 Go? Why?
137	Cailin	 I don’t know. Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
138	Ross	 But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
139	Cailin	 Good bye Ross.
140	Ross	 Uh, oh-ho bye.
141	The Director	 (entering carrying a newspaper) Here we go people! (starts reading the review) Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la… Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
142	Joey	 Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
143	The Director	 Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. (Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is… (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust) Thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother’s crab cakes! (starts to leave) Excuse me!!
144		(Joey steps in a picks up the paper, the gang all look at him.)
145	Joey	 Anyone mind if I save this?

151	Hold Voice	 Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.
152	Monica	 You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
153	Phoebe	 Nah. I kept myself busy.
154		(Both Rachel and Monica walk into their bedrooms, stop, and come back into the living room with confused looks on their faces.)
155	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
156		(They both look at each other, nod their heads ‘All right’ and follow their stuff into their new rooms.)
157	[Scene	 The Theatre, after the party. Joey is trying to comfort Kate.]
158	Joey	 Hey! Are you okay?
159	Kate	 Fabulous.
160	Joey	 Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?
161	Kate	 Become a drama critic!
162	The Director	 (entering, drunk) I am hurt! (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both your houses! (walks away)
163	Kate	 By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
164	Joey	 Oh, classy.
165	Kate	 Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
166	Joey	 Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
167	Kate	 Really. What?
168	Joey	 Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
169	Kate	 Why the Post?
170	Joey	 Oh, you didn’t see the Post?
171	Kate	 No. You?
172	Joey	 No. Why?
173	[Scene	 Kate’s Apartment, Joey and Kate are returning from a night out on the town.]
174	Kate	 (drunk) So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
175	Joey	 Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking.
176	Kate	 Oh, you’re sweet and cute.
177	Joey	 I know! That’s why they trashed me!
178		(They kiss.)
179	Joey	 Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
180	Kate	 What?
181	Joey	 I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
182	Kate	 What? So you never went out with an actress before?
183	Joey	 Kate, do you even like me?
184	Kate	 Of course I do.
185	Joey	 Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
186	Kate	 I don’t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy… Why can’t I just pick someone like you?
187	Joey	 Thanks.
188	Kate	 You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you’re just so, you’re so, so… (She passes out and slumps against his shoulder.)
189	Joey	 (Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay, hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
190		Commercial Break

206	Joey	 Two brothers, one died!

211	Gunther	 (bringing Chandler a cup) This is from the woman at the bar.
212	Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho-ho.
213		(He turns and looks at her. The woman whispers something to Gunther; who comes back and takes the mug away from Chandler.)

216	Monica	 One.
217	Ross	 One.
218	Chandler	 7

220	Ross	 Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
221	Rachel	 You don’t?!
222	Ross	 No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
223	Rachel	 Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
224	Ross	 No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
225	Chandler	 Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
226	Ross	 Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine. (starts to leave)

230		[cut to outside of Central Perk]
231	Ross	 You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy)

234	Tommy	 What’s in the cup, Ross?
235	Ross	 Umm…

240	Tommy	 Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
241		[cut to inside Central Perk, we see Ross quietly tapping on the window, desperately trying to get the gang’s attention, while Tommy is still screaming at him]
242	Rachel	 (not seeing Ross) What’s your favourite thing about summertime?
243	Monica	 Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
244	Rachel	 Yeah…
245	Tommy	 (entering, finished with yelling at Ross, who follows him in shell shocked) (happily) Hey!
246	Rachel	 Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?
247	Tommy	 Ooh, I don’t know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
248	Chandler	 Ohh, that’s a good one.
249		(Ross is having a fit, about how calm Tommy is now)
250	[Scene	 Backstage at Joey’s play, Joey is arriving, late.]

253		[cut to onstage with Lauren standing in for Kate, the doorbell rings.]
254	Lauren	 (answering the door) Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
255	Joey	 (surprised it’s Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Where’s Kate?
256	Lauren	 (whispering) She got a job in L.A.
257	Joey	 (stunned) What?!
258	Lauren	 I’ve been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? (Joey doesn’t answer) Where have you been? Vic?!
259	Joey	 Oh, ahh, go to the window. I’m wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
260	Lauren	 (at the window, she’s looking down out of the window) What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
261	Joey	 (grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering) When is she leaving?
262	Lauren	 (whispering) Tonight. What are you doing?

266	Phoebe	 Oh, I… (starts jabbering incoherently)
267	Chandler	 Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.
268	Ross	 (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
269	Tommy	 Yeah, but you didn’t.
270	Ross	 No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!
271		(We see Tommy go into Joey and Chandler’s apartment)
272	Rachel	 Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.
273	Ross	 I can’t believe no one believes me!
274	Phoebe	 I do, I believe you.
275	Ross	 You do Pheebs?
276	Phoebe	 Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.
277		[cut to Chandler and Joey’s apartment, Tommy is using the phone]

300	Lauren	 So this is it? Victor?
301	Joey	 Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her.
302		(The ladder retracts, taking Joey up into the spaceship for his voyage to Blargon 7, and Kate waves good bye.)
