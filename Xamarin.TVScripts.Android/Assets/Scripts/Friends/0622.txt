2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are there as Phoebe enters.]
3	Phoebe	 (dejected) Hi, you guys.
4	Chandler	 Hey!
5	Monica	 Hi!
6	Rachel	 What’s the matter?
7	Phoebe	 Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
8	Joey	 (nodding knowingly) Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.
9	Phoebe	 No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
10	Chandler	 I’ll give up my ticket.
11	Joey	 Me too.
12	Phoebe	 Okay that’s so generous!
13	Chandler	 And I think Ross is generous too.
14	Phoebe	 Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!
15	Monica and Rachel	 (less than enthused) Great.
16	Phoebe	 Yeah.
17	Rachel	 So what-what is the exhibit.
18	Phoebe	 It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
19	Joey	 Oh man! (Hits Chandler)
20	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
21	Rachel	 Hi!
22	Chandler	 Hey!
23	Joey	 Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
24	Ross	 Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
25	Monica	 Oh that’s great!
26	Ross	 Yeah.
27	Monica	 I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!
28	Ross	 Why? What?
29	Monica	 Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
30	Ross	 No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
31	Rachel	 I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
32	Ross	 Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.
33		(And walks up right behind Ross, and standard sitcom joke 2B follows with the person being insulted standing right behind the person doing the insulting while the rest of the people become frightened and try to warn the insulter about the insultee’s presence.)
34	Chandler	 Ross.
35	Ross	 Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…
36		(Paul reveals his presence by laughing, thus concluding standard sitcom joke 2B. Paul then pulls Ross aside to have a little chat with him and tells the rest of the group that he’ll just be one second.)
37	Paul	 Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.
38	Ross	 Really? That okay, that’s great.
39	Paul	 Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.
40	Ross	 All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
41	Paul	 Yes it does.
42	Ross	 But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
43	Paul	 I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
44	Ross	 Ohh! A man with a plan!
45		Opening Credits
46	[Scene	 A Dry Cleaners, Joey is there with Phoebe and is trying to get his picture put back amongst the other celebrities hanging on the walls.]
47	Phoebe	 Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
48	Joey	 I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…
49	Phoebe	 (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great together!
50		(The dry cleaner finishes with the customer in front of Joey and they approach the counter.)
51	Joey	 Hey! So I’m back.
52	The Dry Cleaner	 Who are you?
53	Joey	 Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn’t remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.
54	The Dry Cleaner	 (picking up a TV Guide) Show me in the table.
55	Joey	 Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.
56	The Dry Cleaner	 Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.
57	Joey	 Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)
58	Phoebe	 So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?
59		(The dry cleaner just stares at her and she retreats.)
60	[Scene	 The Morgan Chase Museum, the girls are entering.]
61	Monica	 Oh, I love museums!
62	Rachel	 Umm.
63	Monica	 Soakin’ up all the culture.
64	Rachel	 Yeah.
65	Monica	 Where do you want to start?
66	Rachel	 Ooh, the gift shop!
67	Monica	 Yeah!
68	Phoebe	 Hey, and then lunch.
69	Rachel	 Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
70	Phoebe	 Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?
71	Rachel	 What?! No! Why?!
72	Phoebe	 No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
73		(A museum official enters with another man and woman.)
74	The Museum Official	 (to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points), and put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)
75	Rachel	 I didn’t know you could get married here.
76	Monica	 This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)
77	The Museum Official	 (To Monica) May I help you?
78	Rachel	 Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
79	The Museum Official	 Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry! (She kinda storms out with the couple.)
80	Rachel	 Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
81	Monica	 What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.
82	Phoebe	 Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
83	Rachel	 Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
84	Monica	 Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
85	Rachel	 I’m gonna do it too!
86	Phoebe	 Me too!
87	Rachel	 Really? Who would, who would you marry?
88	Phoebe	 I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
89	Rachel	 Oh Pheebs.
90	Phoebe	 Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
91	Monica	 Phoebe, that stuff is…
92	Phoebe	 Don’t even get me started on yours!
93	[Scene	 The Dry Cleaners, Joey is trying to get his picture up again.]
94	Joey	 (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
95	The Dry Cleaner	 I did.
96	Joey	 All right, let’s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)
97	The Dry Cleaner	 No! It don’t go up on the wall!
98	Joey	 What—But you saw the show!
99	The Dry Cleaner	 Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
100	Joey	 Dry cleaners?
101	The Dry Cleaner	 Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
102	Joey	 Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
103	The Dry Cleaner	 That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
104	Joey	 Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.
105	The Dry Cleaner	 I’ve never seen it!
106	Joey	 Oh you should, it’s great.
107		(The Dry Cleaner stares at him and Joey retreats.)
108	[Scene	 A Cabin in the Woods, Elizabeth is giving Ross a tour.]
109	Ross	 This place is really beautiful!
110	Elizabeth	 Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s.
111	Ross	 Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
112	Elizabeth	 Sure!
113		(They fall to the couch and start to make out, but Ross stops suddenly.)
114	Elizabeth	 Are you okay? What’s wrong?
115	Ross	 Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
116	Elizabeth	 Well, whatever works for ya…
117	Ross	 No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
118	Elizabeth	 Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.
119	Ross	 Yeah.
120		(They start making out again.)
121	Elizabeth	 (quietly) Hey umm, you brought protection right?
122	Ross	 (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
123	Elizabeth	 I’ll just run to the store and get some.
124	Ross	 Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
125	Elizabeth	 Do you know where the store is?
126	Ross	 No.
127	Elizabeth	 Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
128	Ross	 A little bit.
129	Elizabeth	 (laughs) I’ll be back in ten minutes.
130	Ross	 Okay.
131	Elizabeth	 Why don’t you get in the hot tub and I’ll meet you there.
132	Ross	 Ohh, okay.
133		(Elizabeth leaves and Ross starts to remove his clothing right there in the middle of the living room where someone can see him. Of course, someone almost does, but he hears a door opening and…)
134	Rachel	 (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
135		(Ross with his pants around his ankles tries to run, but Dr. Geller forgets that he has his pants around his ankles and falls down trying to flee.)
136	Paul	 (To Rachel) Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen.
137		(Dr. Geller, the man with the Ph.D. in Paleontology, is trying to find a place to hide, but this supposedly intelligent man in the hands of clich�d scriptwriters runs around with his pants down around his ankles like one of the Three Stooges.)
138	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is reading the newspaper as the phone rings. He let’s the machine answer it.]
139	Chandler	 (on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.
140	The Museum Official	 (on phone) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available… (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)
141	Chandler	 (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!
142		Commercial Break
143	[Scene	 Paul’s Cabin, Paul and Rachel are sitting on the couch drinking wine and talking.]
144	Rachel	 It’s so secluded up here.
145	Paul	 I know. I like it up here.
146	Rachel	 I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)
147	Paul	 What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
148	Rachel	 No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?
149	Paul	 Honey, we don’t have any bears here.
150	Rachel	 Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
151	Paul	 Okay. I’ll be right back. (Gets up and heads for the kitchen.)
152	Rachel	 Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.) What?! What are you doing here?!
153	Ross	 What are you doing here?!
154	Rachel	 I came with Paul!
155	Ross	 Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
156	Rachel	 Get up!
157	Paul	 (entering) Here you go honey! (Rachel kicks Ross back under the couch.)
158	Rachel	 Ahh. Thank you!
159	Paul	 Diet Coke. (Hands her the glass.)
160	Rachel	 Op, ice. I need ice.
161	Paul	 Okay.
162	Rachel	 Thank you.
163	Paul	 I’ll be right back. (He goes to get the ice.)
164	Ross	 (under the couch) You and your ice.
165	Rachel	 Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.)
166	Ross	 (before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
167	Rachel	 Go-go!
168	Paul	 (entering) Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
169	Rachel	 Ohh, thank you.
170	Paul	 I’m so happy that you’re here.
171	Elizabeth	 (entering) Here I am!
172	Paul	 (jumping up) Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth’s here! Who are you talking to?
173	Elizabeth	 Uh, you guys?
174	Paul	 How did you know we were here?
175	Elizabeth	 Umm…
176	Rachel	 Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
177	Elizabeth	 Obviously.
178	Paul	 Elizabeth, what are you doing here?! (Motions that he brought Rachel here to be alone with her.)
179	Rachel	 Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
180	Elizabeth	 Yeah! Yep.
181	Rachel	 Well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in) and do your homework?
182	Elizabeth	 Ohh, I wouldn’t do it in there. That’s my dad’s bedroom.
183	Rachel	 That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling) That’s your dad’s bedroom!
184	Paul	 Why are you yelling?
185	Rachel	 Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
186	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is sitting at the kitchen table staring at the phone as Monica enters.]
187	Monica	 Hi, honey.
188	Chandler	 (gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
189	Monica	 What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
190	Chandler	 (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)
191		(Monica puts the groceries down and goes to check the answering machine and hears.)
192	The Museum Official	 (on machine) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller.
193	Monica	 Oh no!
194	The Museum Official	 (on machine) I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available…
195	Monica	 Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!
196	Chandler	 (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
197	Monica	 NOOOO!!!!!!!!
198	[Scene	 The Dry Cleaner’s, Joey has brought in a bunch of laundry in another attempt to get his picture on the wall, but the dry cleaner isn’t working right now. Instead, a beautiful woman is working.]
199	Female Clerk	 Can I help you?
200	Joey	 Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?
201	Female Clerk	 He’s not here right now.
202	Joey	 Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
203	Female Clerk	 Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there. (She makes eyes at him.)
204	Joey	 Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You’re the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
205	[Scene	 Paul’s Cabin, continued from earlier.]
206	Paul	 So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
207	Elizabeth	 Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible!
208	Paul	 Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?
209	Elizabeth	 Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
210	Rachel	 Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me something from the car.
211	Paul	 What do you need from the car?
212	Rachel	 Surprise me.
213	Paul	 (whispering) Okay. (Starts for the car.)
214	Rachel	 (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
215		(Rachel and Elizabeth go upstairs. Paul starts for the car, but notices his luggage is still out and decides to take in into the bedroom.)
216		[Cut to his bedroom, Ross is listening at the door as Paul opens the door, trapping Ross behind it. With Paul’s back turned Ross coils up like a snake and slitters underneath the bed.]
217	Paul	 (standing in front of a mirror and to himself) Just relax. Just relax Paul, you’re doing great. (Ross moves a piece of luggage over so he can watch Paul.) She likes you. She… Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y’know why? Because you’re a (pause) neat guy. (Ross can’t believe what he’s hearing.) You are the man. You are (pause) the man! (He opens his shirt and looks at his chest.) I still got it. Nice and sexy. You’re just a love machine. (Starts singing) I’m just a love machine and I won’t work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! (Flexes and grunts loudly.) Showtime. (Starts to leave and starts singing.) I’m just a love machine, yeah ba-by! (Grunts again and Ross is stunned.)
218	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Monica rushes in.]
219	Monica	 Phoebe!
220	Phoebe	 Yeah?
221	Monica	 Have you seen Chandler?!
222	Phoebe	 No! Why?
223	Monica	 The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad is this?!
224	Phoebe	 Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
225	Monica	 I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!
226	Phoebe	 What are you gonna do?
227	Monica	 Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure! (Mimicking her.) "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
228	Phoebe	 Rachel said that!
229	Monica	 Well Rachel’s not here! (Runs out.)
230	[Scene	 The Dry Cleaner’s, Joey and Phoebe are entering to see if his picture is on the wall.]
231	Phoebe	 Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
232	Joey	 I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
233	The Dry Cleaner	 (entering) Son of a bitch!
234	Phoebe	 Okay, maybe ask this guy.
235	The Dry Cleaner	 You, get out of my shop!
236	Phoebe	 Well, what did he do?
237	The Dry Cleaner	 He went out with my wife!
238	Phoebe	 Joey!
239	Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife! (The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)
240	The Dry Cleaner	 That’s my wife!!! Get out! (Starts yelling at him in Russian, and I’m betting he’s not saying pleasant things about him.)
241	Phoebe	 Well, we should go.
242	Joey	 Yeah.
243	[Scene	 Paul’s Bedroom, Elizabeth is entering.]
244	Elizabeth	 Ross? Ross?
245	Ross	 Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?
246	Elizabeth	 Okay!
247	Rachel	 (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
248		(Ross frantically starts to open the window as Paul enters and traps him halfway out the window.)
249	Paul	 Ross!
250	Rachel	 Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
251	Ross	 (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
252	Paul	 Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
253	Elizabeth	 Daddy!
254	Paul	 You’re next!!
255	Elizabeth	 Okay. I didn’t know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)
256	Paul	 Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
257	Ross	 Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…
258	Paul	 No, let me explain! Fired!!
259	Ross	 All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
260	Paul	 (panicked) What?
261	Ross	 And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul’s flexing.)
262	Paul	 Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
263	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is pacing, waiting for Chandler to return. Chandler enters.]
264	Monica	 (going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
265	Chandler	 I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
266	Monica	 Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?
267	Chandler	 Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
268	Monica	 Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…
269	Chandler	 Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
270	Monica	 It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.
271	Chandler	 Okay.
272	Monica	 Really?
273	Chandler	 Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…
274	Monica	 I know! I know.
275	Chandler	 Okay. (They hug.)
276	Monica	 I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I was really worried about you. (Exits.)
277	Phoebe	 (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?
278	Chandler	 Totally.
279	Phoebe	 So did Heldi show you the place?
280	Chandler	 Yeah, it’s beautiful.
281	Phoebe	 I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
282	Chandler	 I know.
283		(They hug.)
284		Ending Credits
285	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is going up to the counter.]
286	Joey	 Hey Gunther.
287	Gunther	 Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there (points) wants the biscotti.
288	Joey	 Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
289	Gunther	 Do you still work here?
290	Joey	 No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.
291	Gunther	 Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
292	Joey	 Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)
