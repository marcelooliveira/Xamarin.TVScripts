3	Chandler	 (entering) Hey!
4	Joey	 Hey!
5	Chandler	 Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
6	Joey	 No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
7	Chandler	 Yeah!
8	Joey	 Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
9	Chandler	 You’re building a post office?
10	Joey	 No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.
11	Chandler	 Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.
12	Joey	 Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.
13		(Chandler goes to his bedroom and opens the door. However, only the top half opens, and he trips into his bedroom over the bottom half.)
14	Joey	 Power saw kinda got away from me there.
15		Opening Credits
16	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is pacing back and forth waiting for someone.]
17	Rachel	 (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs.
18	Phoebe	 Hey!
19	Rachel	 Any sign of your brother?
20	Phoebe	 No, but he’s always late.
21	Rachel	 I thought you only met him once?
22	Phoebe	 Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’
23	Rachel	 Well relax, he’ll be here.
24	Phoebe	 No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.
25	Rachel	 Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
26	[Scene	 inside Central Perk]
27	Chandler	 Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
28	Monica	 No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
29	Chandler	 All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
30	Joey	 Her what?
31	Chandler	 Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.
32	Ross	 Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
33	Monica	 So, Chandler, who’s on your list?
34	Chandler	 Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
35	Rachel	 Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?
36	Chandler	 I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
37	Joey	 Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
38	Monica	 First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
39	Joey	 It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?
40	Rachel	 Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
41	Ross	 Spiderman?
42	Rachel	 Hardy Boy.
43	Chandler	 Peter Parker.
44	Ross	 Thank you.
45	Rachel	 What about you honey, who would be on your list?
46	Ross	 Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
47	Chandler	 (coughing) What a geek!
48	Phoebe	 (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
49	All	 Oh, hi.
50	Phoebe	 This is everybody. This is Ross.
51	Frank	 How are you?
52	Ross	 Hey.
53	Phoebe	 Chandler.
54	Chandler	 Hi.
55	Frank	 Hi.
56	Phoebe	 Joey.
57	Joey	 Hey-hey!
58	Frank	 Hey.
59	Phoebe	 This is Monica.
60	Frank	 Whoa!
61	Phoebe	 And this is Rachel.
62	Rachel	 Hi!
63	Frank	 Whoa!!
64	Phoebe	 I’m gonna get coffee.
65	Frank	 Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
66	Chandler	 We don’t, really.
67	Rachel	 Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
68	Phoebe	 Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
69	Frank	 Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
70	Chandler	 You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.
71	Joey	 I know.
72	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey’s, Joey is drilling a hole in the wall and the drill comes out the other side really close to Chandler’s head. Chandler then rushes out to talk to Joey.]
73	Joey	 Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?
74	Chandler	 No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
75	Joey	 Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
76	Chandler	 I do NOT want this unit!!
77	Joey	 Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader. Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.
78	Chandler	 Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
79	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, Joey is entering]
80	Monica	 Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?
81	Joey	 Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
82	Monica	 Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?
83	Joey	 Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.
84	Monica	 I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
85	Joey	 Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
86	Monica	 I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
87	Joey	 Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)
88	Monica	 That’s a little more than I wanted to see.
89	Joey	 (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
90	Monica	 I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
91		(Joey places the toliet brush and holder over the hole, which is in the middle of the floor.)
92	Joey	 Eh! There you go.
93	Monica	 You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
94	[Scene	 Phoebe’s, Frank and her, are sitting on the counh, watching TV]
95	Phoebe	 (sits up) Oh, ew!
96	Frank	 What?
97	Phoebe	 Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
98	Frank	 What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)
99	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)
100	Frank	 Your not doing it.
101	Phoebe	 Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....
102	Frank	 When’s your birthday?
103	Phoebe	 Feburary 16th.
104	Frank	 I know a guy who’s the 18th.
105	Phoebe	 Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?
106	Frank	 October 25th.
107	Phoebe	 That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
108	Frank	 Melt stuff.
109	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is working on his list]
110	Ross	 Okay, I’ve got three of my five.
111	Rachel	 Three of your five, what?
112	Ross	 Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
113	Rachel	 Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
114	Ross	 Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.
115	Chandler	 All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
116	Ross	 Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
117	Chandler	 Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
118	Ross	 Susan Sarandon.
119	Chandler	 Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
120	Ross	 And!! Isabella Rosselini.
121	Chandler	 Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.
122	Rachel	 So?
123	Chandler	 So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.
124	Rachel	 Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
125	[Scene	 Phoebe’s, Frank is melting a plastic spoon.]
126	Phoebe	 Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
127	Frank	 Yeah.
128	Phoebe	 So is it like art?
129	Frank	 Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
130	Phoebe	 Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
131	Frank	 No, I wanna melt it.
132	Phoebe	 Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
133	Frank	 (starts laughing) Yeah!
134	Phoebe	 G’night, bro.
135	Frank	 G’night.
136	Phoebe	 Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.
137	Frank	 Oh, excellent. (starts to melt the fire extinguisher’s hose.)
138		Commercial Break
139	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is eating breakfast with Monica while Frank is playing with num-chucks on the balcony]
140	Monica	 What kind of karate is that?
141	Phoebe	 No kind. He just makes it up.
142	Monica	 So how’s it going with you guys?
143	Phoebe	 So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
144	Monica	 Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.
145	Phoebe	 Ah!!
146	Monica	 Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
147	Phoebe	 Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
148	Monica	 Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
149	Phoebe	 I just asked you.
150	Monica	 I just asked you.
151	Phoebe	 I don’t have time for this.
152	Monica	 No, that is what the game is.
153	Phoebe	 Which you just gave up really quickly.
154	Chandler	 (entering) Have you seen Joey?
155	Monica	 What’s the matter?
156	Chandler	 Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
157	Joey	 (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
158	Chandler	 What’s going on?
159	Monica	 He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
160	Chandler	 Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
161	Monica	 Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
162	Chandler	 He started mine first!
163	Phoebe	 Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
164	[Scene	 Phoebe’s, Phoebe and Frank are watching TV.]
165	Frank	 Whoa! Big octopus.
166	Phoebe	 Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.
167	Frank	 Hey, what kind of work do you do?
168	Phoebe	 Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
169	Frank	 You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
170	Phoebe	 Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!
171	Frank	 (starts laughing) Wow! That’s wild! No, I had no idea.
172	Phoebe	 All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
173	Frank	 You mean like watch?
174	Phoebe	 No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
175	Frank	 Well, I don’t think this, y'know.
176	Phoebe	 No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
177	Frank	 Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
178	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel’s bathroom, Joey and Monica are admiring the new floor.]
179	Monica	 It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?
180	Chandler	 What, like a number?
181	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
182	Chandler	 Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
183	Ross	 Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)
184	Rachel	 Well, it’s about time.
185	Joey	 Ooh, very official.
186	Ross	 Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
187	Monica	 And who laminated it?
188	Ross	 That would be me.
189	Rachel	 All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
190	Ross	 Hey, it’s my list.
191	Rachel	 Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
192	[Scene	 Healing Hands Inc. (Phoebe’s work), Frank is being ushered in, by the arm, to the room Phoebe is in by another girl.]
193	Frank	 Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
194	Phoebe	 Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?
195	Frank	 She broke my arm.
196	Girl	 He touched my fanny.
197	Frank	 No, she touched mine first!
198	Girl	 That’s my job!
199	Frank	 So wait, what’s the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can’t touch you?
200	Phoebe and Girl	 Ewww!!!
201	Phoebe	 You can’t have sex with her!
202	Girl	 What’d you think I was, a hooker?
203	Frank	 No, your a masseuse, it’s cool, I’m not a cop.
204	Phoebe	 Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
205	Jasmine	 Fine. (starts to leave, and points at Frank) I don’t like you!! (leaves)
206	Phoebe	 (turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!! God! That’s not what I do!
207	Frank	 Wait that’s-that’s, what that’s not what you do?
208	Phoebe	 Nooo! Why would you think that?
209	Frank	 I don’t know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don’t know.
210	Phoebe	 Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
211	Frank	 Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can’t believe that I screwed it up so bad.
212	Phoebe	 You really thought it was perfect?
213	Frank	 Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know.
214	Phoebe	 Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
215	Frank	 Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
216	Phoebe	 I don’t....
217	Frank	 How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’t melt.
218	Phoebe	 Right, okay, um-mm.
219	Frank	 Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you ‘cause y'know you’re my sister, y'know.
220	Phoebe	 Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
221	Frank	 Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
222	Phoebe	 Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.
223	Frank	 You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
224	Phoebe	 Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
225	Frank	 This?
226	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
227	Frank	 Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
228	Phoebe	 She wasn’t a hooker.
229	Frank	 Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
230	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey’s, everyone is there, helping to lift the entertainment center into place]
231	Chandler	 Okay, on three. One....Two....
232	Joey	 Why don’t we just go on two.
233	Chandler	 Why two?
234	Joey	 Because it’s faster.
235	Chandler	 Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.
236	Rachel	 Oh!
237	Joey	 All right, but in the future...
238	Ross	 Okay!! Okay!!
239	Rachel	 Come on!
240	Ross	 Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
241	Chandler	 Okay, one...two...
242	Joey	 So we are going on two?
243	All	 All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem, the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)
244	Chandler	 Oh, good job Joe.
245	Joey	 Wow, it’s big!
246	Chandler	 Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
247	Joey	 Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.
248	Phoebe	 Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
249	Joey	 Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
250	Chandler	 Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn’t move.)
251	Joey	 Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
252	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is serving some guy coffee.]
253	Rachel	 Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.
254		(Isabella Rosselini enters)
255	Ross	 (to Gunther) Thank you.
256	Isabella	 (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.
257		(Ross recognises her and goes over to the couch, mouthing ‘Oh my God’
258	Ross	 Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
259	Monica	 Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
260	Ross	 Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
261	Monica	 Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?
262	Ross	 Yeah, maybe.
263	Rachel	 Oh-oh, you lie.
264	Ross	 What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
265	Rachel	 Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
266	Ross	 Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
267	Rachel	 You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.
268	Ross	 Okay, hold my crawler.
269	Rachel	 Okay.
270	Monica	 Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
271	Rachel	 Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.
272	Ross	 (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
273	Isabella	 Aren’t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who waves back)
274	Ross	 Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.
275	Isabella	 I’m sorry. (starts to leave)
276	Ross	 Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
277	Isabella	 Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
278	Ross	 Um, yeah.
279	Isabella	 May I see it?
280	Ross	 Um, no.
281	Isabella	 Come on! (grabs the list)
282	Ross	 But, okay.
283	Isabella	 (reading it) I’m not on the list!
284	Ross	 Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.
285	Isabella	 It’s laminated!
286	Ross	 Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
287	Isabella	 Y'know it’s ironic...
288	Ross	 What?
289	Isabella	 ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)
290	Ross	 (to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.
291		Closing Credits

296	Chandler	 I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
297	Joey	 Get out your checkbook, mister.
298	Chandler	 Oh, I think I have the cash.

300	Joey	 You are dogged man! I totally fit!
301	Chandler	 Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.
302	Joey	 Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!
