9	Chandler	 It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.

12	Chandler	 Yeah.
13	Joey	 You’re gonna mess it up let me do it.

17	Phoebe	 If!
18	Monica	 (entering) Hey!
19	Ross	 Hey!
20		(Monica’s entrance makes Phoebe try to hide the ring by putting it in her mouth.)

23		(Monica goes into her room.)
24	Chandler	 (To Phoebe) Give me it!
25	Phoebe	 It’s gone.
26	Chandler	 Phoebe!
27		(She takes it out of her mouth and hands it to him as Monica returns from her room and this time forcing Chandler to put the ring in his mouth.)
28	Joey	 Hey!
29	Chandler	 (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
30		(She goes into the bathroom.)
31	Phoebe	 (To Chandler) We’re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
32		Opening Credits
33	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey are there as Rachel enters.]
34	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
35	Chandler	 Hey!
36	Joey	 Hey Rach!
37	Rachel	 Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
38	Chandler	 (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!
39	Rachel	 Oh my God, I’m so sorry.
40	Monica	 What’s the big deal?
41	Chandler	 I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.
42	Joey	 Where are you going?
43		(Chandler stares at him.)
44	Rachel	 How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
45	Phoebe	 Open bar?
46	Rachel	 I think so.
47	Phoebe	 I can do that for the kids.
48	Joey	 Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back.
49	Chandler	 Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
50	Joey	 Okay. Have a benefit.
51	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
52	Rachel	 Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
53	Ross	 Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
54	Chandler	 Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids.
55	Ross	 I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
56	Monica	 Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
57	Chandler	 Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!
58	Monica	 Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
59	Ross	 I don’t know.
60	Phoebe	 Y’know, you are 12 years older than her.
61	Ross	 Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
62	All	 Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I’m sorry.
63	Ross	 Uh-uh—Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
64	Joey	 That’s not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)
65	Rachel	 See? Now, he could date her.
66	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is practicing proposing.]
67	Chandler	 Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) What’s going on little elves?
68	Joey	 It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
69	Ross	 Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
70	Chandler	 Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
71	Phoebe	 Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
72	Chandler	 Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.
73	Ross	 (to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
74		(Monica enters from the bedroom.)
75	Monica	 Hi guys.
76	Chandler	 (To Monica) You are beautiful.
77	Monica	 Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) What’s going on?
78	Rachel	 (breaking up) We’re just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
79	[Scene	 The Charity Event, they’re holding a silent auction, Rachel is looking at one of the items and Phoebe walks up and hands her a glass of wine.]
80	Phoebe	 Here.
81	Rachel	 Oh! Thank you!
82	Phoebe	 So now what’s going on here?
83	Rachel	 Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
84	Phoebe	 No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?
85	Rachel	 (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?
86	Phoebe	 No! It’s nice!
87		(Rachel’s boss, Mr. Thompson walks up.)
88	Mr. Thompson	 Nice to see you Rachel.
89	Rachel	 Oh, hi!
90	Mr. Thompson	 So glad you brought someone.
91	Rachel	 Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He’s the head of my department.
92	Phoebe	 Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)
93	Rachel	 And I also brought my friend Joey…
94	Joey	 (behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.)
95	Rachel	 Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is.
96	Mr. Thompson	 Well, I hope you’re gonna bid on some things Rachel.
97	Rachel	 Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
98	Mr. Thompson	 Ohh, nice choice.
99	Rachel	 Yeah.
100	Mr. Thompson	 Good luck.
101	Rachel	 Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he’s left.) Okay, (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.
102	[Scene	 Elizabeth’s Dorm Room, Ross is walking up to her door and knocks on it. Suddenly the door opens and Elizabeth drags him into the room.]
103	{Transcriber’s Note	 Elizabeth has two friends in the room with her who are named in the credits, but not in this scene. So I’m just gonna guess since it doesn’t matter one way or the other. (The last part is to discourage e-mails, who cares if I got it right or not?)}
104	Zoe	 Shut the door! Shut the door!! (Runs over and closes the door.)
105	Ross	 What’s-what’s going on?
106	Elizabeth	 The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
107	Ross	 Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building!
108	Elizabeth	 No, it’s a water balloon fight! We started it!
109	Ross	 Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same…
110	Elizabeth	 (ignoring him and picking up a pitcher) Who drank all the Kamikazes?
111	Sarah	 (approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight and start drinking from the balloons.)
112	Elizabeth	 (To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)
113	Ross	 No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
114	Elizabeth	 Yeah, sure.
115	Ross	 Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh…
116		(Suddenly the door opens and two guys come rushing in wielding water balloons.)
117	First Dorm Guy	 Attack!
118		(They start lobbing the balloons in. Ross desperately tries to get out of the line of fire but is struck in the back. The girls all retreat to relative safety behind the couch.)
119	Second Dorm Guy	 Put your balloons down!
120	The Girls	 You put your balloons down!!
121	First Dorm Guy	 You put your balloons down!!
122		(Both opposing camps start screaming at each other to drop their weapons and surrender. Finally, Ross steps in as a mediator.)
123	Ross	 (screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
124	[Scene	 The Charity Event, Mr. Thompson is announcing the winners of the silent auction.]
125	Mr. Thompson	 Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. (Pause.) It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
126	Rachel	 Ugh! So close!
127		(Phoebe returns a with a tray full of different kinds of drinks.)
128	Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Look!
129	Joey	 Hey!
130	Phoebe	 I got me some drinks!
131	Rachel	 What are you doing?
132	Phoebe	 Open bar!
133	Rachel	 Well now it’s an empty bar.
134	Phoebe	 You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?
135	Mr. Thompson	 And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey suddenly gets excited.)
136	Joey	 I won! That was my guess!
137	Rachel	 What?! What?! What?!
138	Joey	 I guessed 20,000!
139	Rachel	 Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!
140	Joey	 What?! I don’t have 20,000!
141	Mr. Thompson	 Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
142		(Everyone applauds and he stands up slowly.)
143	Rachel	 Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
144	Phoebe	 Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]
145	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are sitting at a table. Monica is checking her makeup as Chandler suddenly has a horrifying thought and starts patting down his pockets until he finds what he’s looking for and sighs in relief.]
146	Monica	 What are you doing?
147	Chandler	 (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
148	Monica	 Are you okay?
149	Chandler	 Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
150	Monica	 Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?
151	Chandler	 Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
152	Monica	 (laughs) Are you sure you’re okay?
153	Chandler	 Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
154	Monica	 Ohh that’s sweet!
155	Chandler	 Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…
156		(As he’s talking Monica notices someone familiar has just entered the restaurant. Let’s see; I seem to remember him driving a Ferrari in Hawaii solving crimes as a private investigator and as a certain eye doctor in more recent times.)
157	Monica	 (interrupting him) Oh my God!
158	Chandler	 (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.
159	Monica	 Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard’s back.)
160	Chandler	 What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!
161	Monica	 Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!
162		(Monica smiles then acts shocked. Chandler can’t believe she just did that.)
163	Richard	 (approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!
164	Chandler	 Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did that!
165	Monica	 Hey, it’s good to see you!
166	Richard	 You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
167	Monica	 Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
168	Richard	 Well, my nose got lonely.
169	Chandler	 (to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.
170	Richard’s Date	 Hi, I’m Lisa.
171	Chandler	 Hi.
172	Richard	 Oh, I’m sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
173	Chandler	 Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.
174	Monica	 Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?
175	Chandler	 Yeah, I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
176	Monica	 (to Richard) It’s good to see you
177	Matire'd	 (to Richard) You’re table’s ready sir.
178	Richard	 Oh. Good to see you guys.
179	Chandler	 Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)
180	Matire'd	 (motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandler’s) Or if you prefer, this table is available.
181	Richard	 That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)
182		Commercial Break
183	[Scene	 The Charity Event, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are sitting at their table.]
184	Rachel	 What were you thinking?!
185	Joey	 I didn’t know it was an auction!
186	Rachel	 Wh?!
187	Joey	 I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
188	Rachel	 Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
189	Joey	 I don’t know! Charity?
190	Rachel	 Ugh!
191	Phoebe	 Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through her tray of booze.)
192	Rachel	 Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?
193	Phoebe	 I’m just helping the kids!
194	Rachel	 How is you drinking helping the kids?
195	Phoebe	 Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
196	Mr. Thompson	 (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.
197	Joey	 Oh hi!
198	Mr. Thompson	 Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
199	Joey	 Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
200	Mr. Thompson	 I think it was valued at 19,000
201	Joey	 (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.
202		(Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.)
203	Rachel	 Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
204	Mr. Thompson	 That’s good. Very good! (Walks away.)
205		(After he’s left, Rachel stops laughing and glares at Joey again.)
206	Joey	 So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)
207	Rachel	 (stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
208	Joey	 Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!
209	Rachel	 I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.
210	Joey	 Okay.
211	Rachel	 Okay.
212	Joey	 Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
213	Rachel	 Not great.
214	[Scene	 The Restaurant, Monica and Chandler’s and Richard and Lisa’s tables have been pushed together and they’re all eating and talking.]
215	Monica	 And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.
216	Richard	 And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
217	Monica	 So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.
218	Lisa	 (laughing) Oh my God!
219	{Transcriber’s Note	 For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out.}
220	Chandler	 I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
221		(An awkward silence ensues.)
222	Richard	 It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed."
223	Monica	 Ohh.
224	Chandler	 What?!
225		(They all drink.)
226	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning to find Ross is there waiting for them.]
227	Ross	 Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)
228	Chandler	 (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
229	Ross	 Who?
230	Chandler	 Richard!
231	Ross	 What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
232	Chandler	 Oh you knew that. Good!
233	Monica	 I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
234	Ross	 Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
235	Monica	 Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!
236	Ross	 Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
237	Monica	 Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.
238	Ross	 Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
239	Monica	 If the school finds out you’re fired.
240	Ross	 Hmm.
241	Monica	 She’s leaving for three months.
242	Chandler	 For camp!
243	Ross	 Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…
244	Monica	 Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!
245	Ross	 No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.
246	Monica	 Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
247	Ross	 I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
248	Chandler	 Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
249	[Scene	 The Charity Event, Rachel and Phoebe are sitting at the table as Joey approaches.]
250	Joey	 Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
251	Rachel	 Oh great!
252	Joey	 (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
253	Phoebe	 Oh, okay.
254	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
255	Phoebe	 It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
256	Emil Alexander	 That was me.
257	Phoebe	 Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)
258	{Transcriber’s Note	 Please correct my French here.}
259		[Cut to Joey and Rachel approaching table one.]
260	Joey	 Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
261	Mr. Bowmont	 That’s me.
262	Joey	 Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)
263	Rachel	 Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
264	Joey	 You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.
265	Rachel	 (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)
266	Mr. Bowmont	 I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife would’ve killed me.
267	Rachel	 Ohh…
268	Joey	 Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!
269	Rachel	 Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
270	Mr. Bowmont	 It’s Pam.
271	Rachel	 Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
272	Joey	 Aw-awww!
273	Mr. Bowmont	 I don’t think she’d like that.
274	Rachel	 Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
275	Joey	 Oooooh…
276	Mr. Bowmont	 I don’t think so dear.
277	Rachel	 Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to him.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy.
278	Mr. Bowmont	 What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!
279	Joey	 No way! It’s mine!!
280	Rachel	 (To Joey) What?! What?!
281	Joey	 All that stuff you just said? I want that!
282	Rachel	 But Joey you don’t have $20,000!
283	Joey	 Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
284	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is taking out the garbage as Phoebe and Joey enter. Phoebe gasps.]
285	Joey	 Oh my God, you’re back!
286	Phoebe	 Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)
287	Monica	 Why do you want to see my hand?
288	Phoebe	 I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
289	Joey	 Yeah.
290		(Chandler puts his face in his hands as Joey and Phoebe start to examine the trash.)
291	Phoebe	 Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
292	Monica	 (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.)
293	Chandler	 (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
294	Phoebe	 What happened?
295	Chandler	 Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
296	Joey	 What?! Noooo… (Phoebe gasps.)
297	Chandler	 I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!
298	Joey	 We didn’t ruin it!
299	Chandler	 Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
300	Phoebe	 Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…
301	Joey	 Glove salesman!
302	Phoebe	 Good one! Yeah.
303	Chandler	 This is terrible. What am I going to do?
304	Phoebe	 Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
305	Chandler	 That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
306	Phoebe	 Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!
307	Chandler	 I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.
308	Joey	 Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)
309	Monica	 (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
310	Joey	 That guy’s still doing that?!
311	Rachel	 (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!
312	Phoebe	 No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
313	[Scene	 Outside of Elizabeth’s dormitory, Ross is exiting after breaking up with her and we can hear his thoughts.]
314	Ross	 (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
315	Elizabeth	 (sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!
316	Ross	 Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…
317	Elizabeth	 You suck!!
318	Ross	 What?!
319		(She throws a water balloon at him and hits him on the head and hits him again at the waist with another one.)
320	Ross	 Okay, break-up’s still on!
321	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is looking out the window and Joey is sitting on the couch.]
322	Chandler	 Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
323	Joey	 Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each other.) I never noticed that before.
324	Monica	 (entering) Hi guys!
325	Joey	 Hey!
326	Chandler	 Hey!
327	Monica	 What are you up too?
328	Chandler	 Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
329	Joey	 (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
330	Monica	 Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
331	Chandler	 Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
332	Monica	 Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
333	Chandler	 Eh…
334	Monica	 Okay well that’s good to know.
335		(We hear the backup horn of a truck and see through the window that the Mr. Bowmont has arrived.)
336	Joey	 (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the couch and runs out into the street.)
337	[Scene	 Monica’s Restaurant’s kitchen, she’s cooking as a waitress sticks her head in.]
338	Waitress	 Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
339	Monica	 Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)
340	Waitress	 (to the customer) Come on in.
341		(The customer turns out to be…)
342	Richard	 Hi!
343	Monica	 Richard!
344	Richard	 Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef.
345	Monica	 Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?
346	Richard	 Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
347	Monica	 Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
348	Richard	 No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause) to tell you I still love you.
349		Commercial Break
350	[Scene	 Monica’s Restaurant, continued from earlier.]
351	Monica	 What uh—What did you—What?!
352	Richard	 I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
353	Monica	 Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!
354	Richard	 Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
355	Monica	 Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairs back here?!
356	Richard	 I know this is crazy but am I too late?
357	Monica	 What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
358	Richard	 Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
359	Monica	 What were you doing in Africa?
360	Richard	 Working with blind kids.
361	Monica	 Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
362	Richard	 Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.
363	Monica	 Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!
364	Richard	 You are?
365	Monica	 Yeah!
366	Richard	 Why?
367	Monica	 Why? Because of the government.
368	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is bringing Phoebe some coffee.]
369	Rachel	 Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.
370	Phoebe	 I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.
371	Rachel	 Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
372	Phoebe	 Not that often!
373	Rachel	 No! I’m so happy for them!
374	Phoebe	 Me too! So happy for them!
375	Rachel	 I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
376	Phoebe	 Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
377		(They both take a drink of coffee.)
378	Rachel	 I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.
379	Phoebe	 Totally. I’m like 90/10.
380	Rachel	 Yeah me too.
381		(Joey enters looking like Captain Stubing from the Love Boat.)
382	Joey	 Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
383	Rachel	 (staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
384	[Scene	 A Pizza Joint, Chandler and Monica are eating lunch.]
385	Monica	 So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?
386	Chandler	 Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
387	Monica	 Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!
388	Chandler	 If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
389	Monica	 Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
390	Chandler	 Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
391	Monica	 Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
392	Chandler	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
393	Monica	 Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
394		(She gets up and storms out. The people at the other tables are staring at Chandler.)
395	Chandler	 (to them) It’s okay, I got a plan.
396	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still talking.]
397	Rachel	 We’re gonna find love!
398	Phoebe	 Definitely!
399	Rachel	 Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
400	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
401	Rachel	 Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.
402	Phoebe	 You mean a backup?
403	Rachel	 Exactly!
404	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah I got that.
405	Rachel	 You do?
406	Phoebe	 Hm-mmm.
407	Rachel	 Who?
408	Phoebe	 Joey.
409	Rachel	 Joey?!
410	Phoebe	 Yeah!
411	Rachel	 Are you serious?!
412	Phoebe	 Yeah, I locked him years ago!
413	Rachel	 Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.
414	Phoebe	 Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
415	Rachel	 Oh, seriously?
416	Phoebe	 Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
417	Rachel	 Charming.
418	Phoebe	 Well hey, it’s just a backup.
419	Rachel	 Yeah.
420	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, is practicing his slipknots as Monica enters.]
421	Joey	 Hey Monica!
422	Monica	 Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
423	Joey	 This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
424	Monica	 Yeah, it’s great.
425	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!
426	Monica	 I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!
427	Joey	 Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
428	Monica	 It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!
429	Joey	 Well, you know Chandler.
430	Monica	 No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.
431	Joey	 Maybe you changed?
432	Monica	 I didn’t change!
433	Joey	 Maybe that’s the problem.
434	Monica	 What?!
435	Joey	 Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
436	Monica	 Is that some kind of boat talk?
437	Joey	 I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
438	Monica	 What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?
439	Joey	 Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
440	Monica	 (starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
441	Joey	 There are?
442	Monica	 Yeah! Richard!
443	Joey	 R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!
444	Monica	 That’s right.
445	Joey	 Chandler loves marriage!!
446	Monica	 You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
447	Joey	 You got that from what I said?!
448	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross is watching a show about the extinction of the dinosaurs.]
449	Narrator	 When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
450	Ross	 What happened you guys?
451		(There’s a knock on the door, he shuts the TV off, and answers it.)
452	Ross	 Rach!
453	Rachel	 Hey you!
454	Ross	 Hey, come on in.
455	Rachel	 Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
456	Ross	 Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
457	Rachel	 Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
458	Ross	 I guess so.
459	Rachel	 So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!"
460	Ross	 Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
461	Rachel	 Exactly.
462	Ross	 Ohh, yeah I already have one.
463	Rachel	 What? Who?
464	Ross	 Phoebe.
465	Rachel	 Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
466	Ross	 Ohh, I don’t think so.
467	Rachel	 Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
468	Ross	 That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
469	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is entering to find Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, on the phone.]
470	Joey	 Where the hell have you been?!
471	Chandler	 I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
472	Joey	 Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
473	Chandler	 What?!
474	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!
475	Chandler	 My—Oh my God!
476	Joey	 I know! They suck!!
477	Chandler	 He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!
478	Joey	 I know!
479	Chandler	 Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
480	Joey	 Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
481	Chandler	 You’re right.
482	Joey	 Yeah!
483	Chandler	 Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I’m just going to propose!
484	Joey	 Okay.
485	Chandler	 Okay great.
486	Joey	 Dude-dude-dude!
487	Chandler	 What?!
488	Joey	 Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
489		Commercial Break
490	[Scene	 Richard’s Apartment, he’s smoking a cigar and reading a book as there is a knock on the door. He gets up and opens the door to reveal…]
491	Monica	 Hi.
492	Richard	 Hi.
493	Monica	 I don’t know why I’m here.
494	Richard	 I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?
495	Monica	 I don’t know.
496	Richard	 Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. (Does so.)
497	Monica	 (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
498	Richard	 (standing up quickly) Drink?
499	Monica	 Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…
500	Richard	 …on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)
501	Monica	 (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
502	Richard	 Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
503	Monica	 No that’s, that’s okay.
504	Richard	 So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
505	Monica	 Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
506	Richard	 Oh really?
507	Monica	 Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.
508	Richard	 Who is it?
509	Monica	 Edward Nevski?
510	Richard	 Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause) non-eye doctor way?
511	Monica	 No.
512	Richard	 Ahh.
513	Monica	 But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
514		(Richard mouths, "Wow!")
515	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is reading as Rachel enters.]
516	Rachel	 Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
517	Phoebe	 Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!
518	Rachel	 What?!
519	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
520	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
521	Joey	 Phoebe! We’re both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!
522	Ross	 Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
523	Phoebe	 I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
524		(At the same time.)
525	Joey	 No we weren’t!
526	Ross	 I was not!
527	Phoebe	 Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
528	Rachel	 Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!
529	Joey	 Pick me!!
530	Ross	 No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
531	Phoebe	 All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!
532	Joey	 This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
533	Ross	 Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
534		(Rachel gets all happy.)
535	Phoebe	 No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
536	Rachel	 Oh God, Phoebe!
537	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.
538	Rachel	 Oh.
539		(She turns her head away and when she’s not looking, Phoebe shakes her head and mouths, "No, I’m not." Both Joey and Ross smile, look at each other, and then stop smiling.)
540	Rachel	 Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
541	Joey	 Okay that’s fair.
542	Ross	 All right.
543	Phoebe	 Good!
544		(Rachel mixes them up in her hands, moves them all around, and puts her hands behind her back.)
545	Rachel	 Pick one.
546	Phoebe	 Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.
547	Rachel	 You’re welcome.
548	Phoebe	 (reading) Ross!
549	Rachel	 (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
550	Phoebe	 Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
551	Joey	 Yeah.
552	[Scene	 Richard’s Apartment, Monica is looking around and notices an African mask hanging on the wall.]
553	Monica	 (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
554	Richard	 Excuse me?
555	Monica	 Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
556	Richard	 Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!
557	Monica	 I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
558	Richard	 Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
559	Monica	 Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!
560	Richard	 I think that’s fair.
561	Monica	 Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
562	Richard	 It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh.
563	Monica	 Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…
564	Richard	 I know. (Backs away.)
565	Monica	 Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…
566	Richard	 Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I’ll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)
567	[Scene	 Richard’s Apartment, time lapse. Richard is smoking as he hears a knock on the door. He quickly puts out his cigar and opens the door.]
568	Richard	 Chandler.
569	Chandler	 Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)
570	Richard	 She’s not here and please come in.
571	Chandler	 (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
572	Richard	 Okay, she was here, but she left.
573	Chandler	 Well where did she go?
574	Richard	 Well she said she had to think things over.
575	Chandler	 Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
576	Richard	 Oh, hey look nothing happened.
577	Chandler	 Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
578	Richard	 Well all right, one thing happened?
579	Chandler	 Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
580	Richard	 Well I’m sorry.
581	Chandler	 And what does she have to think about? I love her!
582	Richard	 Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.
583	Chandler	 But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!
584	Richard	 Well if it helps, it worked very well.
585	Chandler	 It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.
586	Richard	 You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)
587	Chandler	 Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?
588	Richard	 No I don’t have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me.
589	Chandler	 Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
590	Richard	 I know. (Pause) I hate that!
591		(Chandler gets up and runs out, but as soon as the door closes behind him he opens it, runs back in, picks up his ring Richard is holding up for him, and runs back out.)
592	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler is running up the stairs and towards his apartment, but Joey is taking out the garbage at the same time and stops him in the hall.]
593	Joey	 Dude!
594	Chandler	 I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
595	Joey	 She’s gone.
596	Chandler	 What?
597	Joey	 She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.
598	Chandler	 What are you talking about?
599	Joey	 She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
600	Chandler	 Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
601	Joey	 I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.
602	Chandler	 Well where… Where did she go?
603	Joey	 To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.
604	Chandler	 I can’t believe I ruined this.
605	Joey	 I am so sorry man.
606		(He walks dejectedly into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles and Monica standing in the living room.)
607	Monica	 You wanted it to be a surprise.
608		(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)
609	Chandler	 Oh my God.
610		(Monica gets down on one knee.)
611	Monica	 Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
612	Chandler	 Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
613	Monica	 Yes.
614		(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as an engaged couple.)
615	Monica	 I knew you were likely to take a wife!
616		(They hug again.)
617	Joey	 (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
618	Monica	 Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!
619		(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)
620	Rachel	 Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
621	Phoebe	 Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
622	Monica	 Oh…
623	Rachel	 Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
624	Joey	 Yeah!
625		(They all hug again.)
