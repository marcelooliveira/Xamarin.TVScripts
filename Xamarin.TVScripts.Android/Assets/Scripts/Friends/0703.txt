2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Ross, and Monica are all there as Chandler enters wearing glasses.]
3	Chandler	 Hey, you guys!
4	Ross and Rachel	 Hey!
5	Chandler	 So, what do you think?
6	Ross	 About what?
7	Rachel	 Yeah, what?
8	Joey	 What?
9	Chandler	 Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)
10	Joey	 Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!
11	Chandler	 I got glasses!
12	Ross	 Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.
13	Chandler	 No I didn’t!
14	Ross	 Are you sure?
15	Rachel	 Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…
16	Joey	 Feminine.
17	Rachel	 Yes!
18	Chandler	 No!
19	Monica	 Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
20	Chandler	 Really?
21	Monica	 Yeah!
22	Chandler	 (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to wear glasses, right?
23	Monica	 Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)
24		Opening Credits
25	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are making some sandwiches.]
26	Phoebe	 So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
27	Chandler	 That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…
28	Monica	 (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy.
29	Rachel	 Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
30	Monica	 Oh, I already have one.
31	Phoebe	 Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
32	Rachel	 Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
33	Monica	 Hey, I know what I want!
34	Chandler	 What we want honey.
35	Monica	 No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.
36	Phoebe	 You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
37	Monica	 Uh-huh, yeah.
38	Phoebe	 You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
39	Chandler	 Dying people say the craziest things.
40	Monica	 I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
41	Phoebe	 Break my heart—Oh, all right.
42	Monica	 Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.
43	Chandler	 Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
44	Joey	 (entering) Ahoy!
45	Chandler	 Hey! How’s the boat?!
46	Joey	 Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.
47	Monica	 Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
48	Joey	 Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
49	Phoebe	 If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?
50	Joey	 Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
51	Chandler	 Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
52	Rachel	 Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
53	Joey	 You could?
54	Rachel	 Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
55	Phoebe	 Your own boat?
56	Rachel	 What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
57	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there. He takes off his glasses and starts chewing on the ear piece.]
58	Chandler	 Do you know what I was thinkin’?
59	Monica	 What?
60	Chandler	 Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
61	Ross	 (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
62	Chandler	 Uh why, do you have a lecture?
63	Ross	 No, why?
64	Chandler	 Then free as a bird. What’s up?
65	Ross	 My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
66	Monica	 Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.
67	Ross	 Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
68	Chandler	 Well, did-did you correct him?
69	Ross	 No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
70	Monica	 This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
71	Ross	 Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
72	Monica	 Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
73	Ross	 Yeah.
74	Monica	 He hates to lose.
75	Chandler	 Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.
76	Ross	 You’re not a lefty?
77	Chandler	 Does anybody know me?!
78		(Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and exhales exasperatedly.)
79	Monica	 What’s wrong Phoebe?
80	Phoebe	 I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
81	Monica	 No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
82	Phoebe	 (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
83	Ross	 Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
84	Chandler	 Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
85	Ross	 No one got me an engagement present.
86	Phoebe	 Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
87	Chandler	 An old cookie?
88	Monica	 (To Chandler) This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!
89	Phoebe	 See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
90	Chandler	 We can’t accept this.
91	Phoebe	 Why not?
92	Chandler	 ‘Cause it’s gross.
93	Monica	 No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
94	Phoebe	 Really?!
95	Monica	 Yeah! I bet I can do it.
96		(Chandler looks over and sees Ross glaring at them.)
97	Chandler	 Okay, we owe you a present.
98	Ross	 Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
99	[Scene	 The Mr. Bowmont (Joey’s boat), she’s shown to be in one of the waterways around New York, but in reality she’s in a sound stage on the Warner Bros. lot and we see New York from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. Rachel and Joey are on board.]
100	Joey	 (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
101	Rachel	 That is the Coast Guard.
102	Joey	 What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
103	Rachel	 Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.
104	Joey	 All right.
105	Rachel	 Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
106	Joey	 Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!
107	Rachel	 Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?
108	Joey	 Uh, boat rope.
109	Rachel	 Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
110	Joey	 Uh, rub it?
111	Rachel	 No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
112	Joey	 I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…
113		(Rachel blasts an air horn in his ear.)
114	Rachel	 Time’s up, now you're dead.
115	Joey	 And deaf!
116	Rachel	 Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
117	Joey	 Yes.
118	Rachel	 Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey, you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
119	Joey	 I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
120	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Phoebe are trying to determine the cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]
121	Monica	 All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
122	Phoebe	 You do?
123	Monica	 You don’t? (Laughs) Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.
124	Phoebe	 That and arrogance.
125	Joey	 (entering) Hey.
126	Monica	 Hey! How was sailing?
127	Joey	 I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what’s left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)
128	Monica and Phoebe	 No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
129	Joey	 (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
130	Phoebe	 I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
131	Ross	 (entering with Chandler) Hey.
132	Monica	 Hey! How was it?
133	Ross	 Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…
134	Chandler	 I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
135	Ross	 And what did he ask you not to call him?
136	Chandler	 Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam-filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that’s when it happened.
137		[Cut to the flashback, Chandler’s no longer doing the voice-over.]
138	Chandler	 Guys?
139	Ross	 Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
140	Mr. Geller	 Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)
141		Commercial Break
142	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is finished telling everyone what happened.]
143	Monica	 Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!
144	Chandler	 I know.
145	Monica	 You gave my father a lap dance!
146	Chandler	 Why do they put so much steam in there?!
147	Ross	 ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
148	Chandler	 Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
149	Phoebe	 Come on, it’s not that big a deal!
150	Chandler	 Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
151	Ross	 Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
152	Monica	 Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!
153	Chandler	 I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
154	Ross	 Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
155	Monica	 I wasn’t escaping.
156	Ross	 Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
157	Monica	 I was trying to help out a squirrel.
158	Ross	 You were trying to eat it!
159		(The phone rings.)
160	Chandler	 If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
161	Monica	 (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) I’m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
162	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
163	Chandler	 (getting up) All right, I’m off to see your dad.
164	Ross	 Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?
165	Rachel	 (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
166	Chandler	 Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)
167	Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
168	Rachel	 I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.
169	Ross	 Thank you!
170	Joey	 (entering) Hey.
171	Ross	 Hey.
172	Rachel	 Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?
173	Joey	 Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
174	Rachel	 Why not?
175	Joey	 Because! You’re mean on the boat!
176	Rachel	 What? I was just trying to teach you.
177	Joey	 Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
178	Ross	 Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took me out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.
179	Rachel	 Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
180	Ross	 You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
181	Rachel	 Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
182	Joey	 Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
183	Rachel	 Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
184	Joey	 Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
185	Rachel	 Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!
186	Joey	 Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
187	Rachel	 All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
188	Joey	 You won’t boss me around anymore?
189	Rachel	 I won’t boss you around.
190	Joey	 And you’ll be nice?
191	Rachel	 And, I’ll be nice.
192	Joey	 And you’ll be topless?
193	Rachel	 And—Joey!
194	Joey	 Do you want me to learn?!
195	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes. Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]
196	Monica	 Okay, here’s batch 22. Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
197	Ross	 Let’s give it a shot.
198	Monica	 Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
199	Phoebe	 Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
200	Monica	 No, just a Friday night.
201		(They all take a bite.)
202	Ross	 Oh, these are pretty good.
203	Phoebe	 Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
204	Ross	 Which one was that?
205	Monica	 The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
206	Ross	 Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) I’m okay.
207	Phoebe	 Are there any more from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.
208	Ross	 Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
209	[Scene	 The Mr. Bowmont, it's Joey’s second lesson with Rachel as the resident sailing expert.]
210	Rachel	 Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
211	Joey	 Oh yeah.
212	Rachel	 Right?
213	Joey	 Nope.
214	Rachel	 It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.
215	Joey	 I don’t know why you just don’t say left.
216	Rachel	 Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!
217	Joey	 Huh?
218	Rachel	 (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
219	Joey	 (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?
220	Rachel	 No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
221	Joey	 Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)
222	Rachel	 Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
223	Joey	 Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.
224	Rachel	 Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
225	Joey	 Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
226	Rachel	 (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
227	Joey	 All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!
228	Rachel	 What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!
229	Joey	 Why not?!
230	Rachel	 Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!
231	Joey	 Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
232	Rachel	 Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!
233	Joey	 Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!
234	Rachel	 No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, oh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
235	Joey	 Well, hey I did learn.
236	Rachel	 Really?
237	Joey	 Yeah! Come on.
238	Rachel	 Awww…
239	Joey	 Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It’s the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
240	Rachel	 Left.
241	Joey	 Damnit!
242	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the cookie-trying period has passed. Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the day’s events.]
243	Phoebe	 Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
244	Ross	 Looking up?
245	Phoebe	 Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.
246	Monica	 Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
247	Ross	 Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
248	Phoebe	 Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.
249	Ross	 That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
250	Phoebe	 That’s what you think.
251	Monica	 Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?
252	Phoebe	 Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
253	Monica	 What was her name?
254	Phoebe	 Nesele Toulouse.
255	Monica	 Nestle Tollhouse?!
256	Phoebe	 Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
257	Monica	 (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
258	Phoebe	 (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Oh.
259	Monica	 I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
260	Phoebe	 I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you’re burning in hell!!
261	[Scene	 The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]
262	Chandler	 So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.
263	Mr. Geller	 I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
264	Chandler	 What did you do when they found out?
265	Mr. Geller	 They never did, so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
266		(Chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. Only Chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. You see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and Chandler didn’t seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)
267	Chandler	 So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
268		Ending Credits
269	[Scene	 The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]
270	Rachel	 Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
271	Joey	 Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)
272	Rachel	 Oh we’re not sailing.
273	Joey	 Just pull on it.
274	Rachel	 All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
275	Joey	 What else?
276	Rachel	 (hands him one) Here you go.
277	Joey	 Thank you.
278	Rachel	 Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
279	Joey	 What are you doing?
280	Rachel	 Oh, sorry.
281	Joey	 What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.
282		(More falls out.)
283	Rachel	 Oh whoops.
284	Joey	 Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I’m my dad!
285		End
