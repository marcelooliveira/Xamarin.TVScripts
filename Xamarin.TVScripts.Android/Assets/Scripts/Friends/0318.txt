2	[Scene	 Central Perk, all but Chandler are there, Joey laughs for no apparent reason.]
3	Monica	 (to Joey) What’s so funny?
4	Joey	 Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.
5	Monica	 Oh. (she laughs)
6	Joey	 What-what’s so funny?
7		(Chandler enters with a cigarette.)
8	Gunther	 (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here.
9	Chandler	 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
10	Gunther	 Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
11	Chandler	 Okay.
12		(Chandler hands him the cigarette, and he takes a long drag.)
13	Gunther	 Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler back the cigarette.)
14	Chandler	 No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.
15		(He goes and sits down next to Rachel and puts a cigarette in his mouth, which Rachel takes away from him. He puts another cigarette in his mouth, and Rachel takes it away again.)
16	Chandler	 Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.
17	Rachel	 Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
18	Chandler	 Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
19	Rachel	 Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.
20	Ross	 Pffhah.
21	Rachel	 (to Ross) What’s your problem?
22	Ross	 Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
23	Rachel	 Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
24	Ross	 Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
25	Rachel	 Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
26	Phoebe	 All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
27	Chandler	 Or what my Father called Thursday night.
28		Opening Credits
29	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier, Ross is handing Rachel a cup of coffee.]
30	Ross	 Here you go.
31	Rachel	 Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.
32	Ross	 Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)
33	Frank	 (entering) Hi!
34	Phoebe	 Oh my God!!
35	Frank	 Hi!
36	Phoebe	 Frank! Hi!

38	Phoebe	 What are you doing here?

40	Phoebe	 What happened?
41	Frank	 Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
42	Phoebe	 But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
43	Frank	 Well, we got into a fight ‘cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.

52	Frank	 Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) I’m gonna, I’m gonna get my ah, my fianc�e man!
53	Chandler	 Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.
54	Phoebe	 Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?
55	Monica	 Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?
56	Phoebe	 What, he’s 18.
57	Ross	 Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
58	Joey	 Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
59	Chandler	 Always illegal Joe.
60	Frank	 (entering with his fianc�e Alice, who is obviously much, much older than he is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fianc�e, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)
61	Alice	 Y'know it-it’s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
62	Phoebe	 Yeah, I’m a big surprise.
63		(Ross lets them both sit in his chair.)
64	Monica	 So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
65	Frank	 Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
66	Alice	 And he was my best student.
67	Frank	 Yeah, she was my best teacher.
68	Alice	 Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)
69	Chandler	 If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?
70	Ross	 And so now you guys are gonna be married?
71	Alice	 Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
72		(Both Chandler and Phoebe have shocked looks on their faces.)
73	Rachel	 Oh my God!! Great!
74	Phoebe	 Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?
75	Frank	 I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right?
76	Alice	 Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us.
77	Phoebe	 Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.
78	Alice	 Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
79		(They both growl and hiss at each other and then kiss passionately again.)
80	[Scene	 Chandler’s bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.]
81	Hypnosis Tape	 You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
82	[Scene	 The Moondance Diner, Monica is working, Rachel is having lunch.]
83	Monica	 And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
84	Rachel	 Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
85	Monica	 (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?
86	Pete	 Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.
87	Monica	 Haven’t you and I covered that topic?
88	Pete	 Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….
89	Monica	 Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
90	Pete	 Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
91	Rachel	 (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
92	Monica	 I mean really, think about it.
93	Pete	 Ho-ho, I will.
94	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are being lectured by Phoebe.]
95	Phoebe	 No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!
96	Ross	 Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
97	Phoebe	 No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!
98	Joey	 Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
99	Phoebe	 But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.
100	Joey	 Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
101	Phoebe	 Yes. Not out loud.
102	Ross	 Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
103	Phoebe	 Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
104	Ross and Joey	 No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)
105	Phoebe	 Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
106	Ross and Joey	 No.
107	Phoebe	 Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)
108	Joey	 So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
109	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Monica are entering.]
110	Rachel	 I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
111	Monica	 Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.
112	Rachel	 Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker
113	Monica	 Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) All right, I get your point.
114	Rachel	 All right.
115	Chandler	 (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.
116	Monica	 Hey.
117	Chandler	 Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
118	Monica	 Uh, yeah.
119	Rachel	 Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
120	Chandler	 Y'know what, pretty good.
121	Rachel	 Yeah?
122	Chandler	 Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.

124	Monica	 Here you go.
125	Chandler	 Thanks
126	Rachel	 Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
127	Chandler	 What check thing?
128	Monica	 As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.
129	Chandler	 (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
130	Monica	 That’s Bill Clinton.
131	Chandler	 Who’s he huggin’?
132	Monica	 Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?
133	Chandler	 This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
134	Rachel	 We use it!!
135	Chandler	 There you go!!
136	Rachel	 Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.
137	Monica	 I’m not gonna go out with him.
138	Rachel	 Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
139	Monica	 Or incredibly offensive.
140	Rachel	 Oh yeah, sure, that too.
141		(Chandler is putting on the Chap Stick the same way that women put on lipstick, including the bit with the piece of tissue.)
142	Chandler	 (to the girls who are staring at him) What?
143	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are talking to Frank.]
144	Ross	 All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.
145	Joey	 Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.
146	Frank	 What, you don’t think I know that?
147	Joey	 Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet!
148	Ross	 Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.
149	Frank	 Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about.
150	Joey	 Yeah, in a poem maybe.
151	Ross	 No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.
152	Frank	 You don’t have it anymore?
153	Ross	 No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
154	Frank	 Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
155	Ross	 It didn’t.
156	Frank	 Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice.
157	Joey	 Now, wh-what, what is that like?
158	Frank	 It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
159	Ross	 Yeah, yeah.
160	Joey	 (to Ross) Why can’t I find that?
161	Ross	 Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!
162	Joey	 Well, I want it!
163	Frank	 You can have it!
164	Joey	 I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.
165	Ross	 Oh, no! No!
166	Frank	 It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it!!
167	Joey	 Then you hold on to it!!
168	Frank	 All right, man!!
169	Joey	 All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)
170	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, it’s after Ross and Joey’s talk with Frank, and Phoebe’s is finding out what happened.]
171	Phoebe	 (to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!
172	Joey	 I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.
173	Phoebe	 Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!
174	Ross	 I’m the ring bearer.
175		(As Phoebe stands there in shock and disbelief, Chandler comes out of the bathroom and walks to his bedroom. He’s just got out of the shower and has the towel wrapped around himself high across his chest, and another towel wrapped around his head, like women wear towels. Joey watches Chandler wondering what the hell he’s doing.)
176		Commercial Break
177	[Scene	 Phoebe’s, Phoebe is opening the door.]
178	Phoebe	 Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)
179	Alice	 Oh my God, who died on this?!
180	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
181	Alice	 Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…
182	Phoebe	 Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.
183	Alice	 Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
184	Phoebe	 Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
185	[Scene	 Pete’s office, he is participating in a conference call with three other employees, each of whom are on a different TV screen that he controls with a remote.]
186	Pete	 Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
187	All	 Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
188		(The intercom buzzes.)
189	Secretary	 You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
190	Pete	 Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.
191	Monica	 What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
192	Pete	 Hang on a second. (to the employees) I’ll-I’ll talk to you in the morning. (turns two of the three off) I’m sorry what?
193	Monica	 Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
194	Pete	 Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.
195	Monica	 You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
196	Employee	 Umm, I’m still here.
197	Pete	 (turns off the TV) You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.
198	Monica	 What?!
199	Pete	 Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.
200	Monica	 Okay, umm, you’re a loon.
201	Pete	 Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say?
202	Monica	 I don’t know.
203	Pete	 Why not?
204	Monica	 ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
205	Pete	 One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
206	[Scene	 Phoebe’s, she is coming home. She turns on the lights, and sits down on the couch.]
207	Frank	 (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!
208	Phoebe	 Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
209	Frank	 Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?
210	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
211	Frank	 Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.
212	Phoebe	 What umm, what happened?
213	Frank	 Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
214	Phoebe	 Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
215	Frank	 Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.
216	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?
217	Frank	 Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
218	Phoebe	 Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)
219	Frank	 Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!
220	Phoebe	 Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
221	Frank	 What?
222	Phoebe	 Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
223	Frank	 Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
224	Phoebe	 Okay.
225	Frank	 Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
226	Phoebe	 Okay, but.
227	Frank	 Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go…
228	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Monica ready for her date. The guys are also there. The door buzzes.]
229	Rachel	 Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!
230	Chandler	 (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
231	Monica	 Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
232	Chandler	 Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
233	Monica	 I know!!
234	Chandler	 Okay, then get the lobster!
235	Monica	 (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
236	Pete	 Hi.
237	Rachel	 Hi!!
238	Joey	 Hey!
239	Ross	 Hi!
240		(They’re all staring at him, with big, huge smiles on their faces.)
241	Joey	 Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
242	Monica	 And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.
243	All	 Oh-no-no-no-no….
244	Rachel	 Just one drink?!
245	Monica	 (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?
246	Pete	 Hey, you like pizza?
247	Monica	 Oh, that’s sounds great.
248	Pete	 I know a great little place.
249		[Cut to a shot of the coliseum in Rome, Italy.]
250	[Scene	 A restaurant in Rome, Monica is paying for the pizza.]
251	Pete	 You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!
252	Monica	 Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
253	Pete	 Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that.
254	Monica	 Why, how much is that?
255	Pete	 That’s about 60 cents.
256	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, it’s the middle of the night. Joey is walking into the living room, and runs into the entertainment centre.]
257	Joey	 Every night!!
258		(He starts to walk to the bathroom and hears the hypnosis tape from Chandler’s bedroom.)
259	Hypnosis Tape	 You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)
260	[Scene	 Phoebe’s, Frank is watching TV, and he’s very depressed as Phoebe enters.]
261	Phoebe	 Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.
262	Alice	 Hi Frank.
263	Frank	 Hi, Mrs. Knight.
264	Alice	 Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that what it is?
265	Phoebe	 Yeah, but not just that.
266	Alice	 Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less…
267	Phoebe	 None the less.
268	Alice	 None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)
269	Phoebe	 That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).
270		Closing Credits
271	[Scene	 Chandler’s bedroom, he’s listening to the hypnosis tape again.]
272	Hypnosis Tape	 Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
273	Joey	 (He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
274		(Chandler wakes up and stares at the tape.)
