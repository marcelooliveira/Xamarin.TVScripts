5	Monica	 Rachel!
6	Rachel	 What?
7	Monica	 You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
8	Rachel	 Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
9	Monica	 Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)

12	Rachel	 Right!

14	Rachel	 Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
15	Mr. Treeger	
16		(Rachel opens the trash chute, winces at the smell, and throws the garbage bag in. She then tries to throw the pizza box in, but since it’s so big she jams it into the opening and it prevents the door from closing. She then turns around too see Mr. Treeger watching her.)
17	Mr. Treeger	
18	Rachel	 Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It’s a little old but…
19	Mr. Treeger	
20	Rachel	 I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.
21	Mr. Treeger	
22	Rachel	 No.
23	Mr. Treeger	
24	Rachel	 I didn’t… I never said that.
25	Mr. Treeger	
26	Rachel	 (starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)
27		[Cut to Monica and Rachel’s apartment as Rachel returns in tears.]
28	Monica	 God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
29		Opening Credits
30	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Continued from earlier, Rachel is now telling everyone of her experience in the garbage room.]
31	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
32	Rachel	 Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
33	Joey	 I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
34	Monica	 Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.
35	Rachel	 That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.
36	Joey	 All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)
37	Monica	 (Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?
38	Chandler	 Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.
39	Ross	 So why don’t you quit?
40	Chandler	 You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
41	Ross	 Who is Maria?
42	Chandler	 Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
43	Ross	 You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
44	Chandler	 No!
45	Ross	 So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
46	Chandler	 Oh no, you’ll have to come.
47	[Scene	 Treeger’s apartment, Joey knocks on the door and Treeger opens it.]
48	Mr. Treeger	
49	Joey	 Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
50	Mr. Treeger	
51	Joey	 Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
52	Mr. Treeger	
53	Joey	 I have actually not heard of that.
54	Mr. Treeger	
55	Joey	 Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)
56	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, everyone is still eating breakfast.]
57	Phoebe	 Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!
58	Monica	 What’s the matter?
59	Phoebe	 Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.
60	Monica	 So do them for free.
61	Phoebe	 Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.
62	Ross	 They make you take an oath?
63	Phoebe	 No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
64	Chandler	 Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
65	Phoebe	 No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)
66	Rachel	 Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
67	Monica	 Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
68	Chandler	 Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
69	Monica	 You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!
70	Phoebe	 I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)
71	Ross	 Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
72	Phoebe	 Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
73		[Cut to later, Joey is returning from talking to Mr. Treeger.]
74	Rachel	 Oh! My hero! What happened?
75	Joey	 Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. (Starts to leave)
76	Monica	 What a minute, what did he say?
77	Joey	 He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.
78	Rachel	 What?! You got us evicted!!
79	Monica	 I told you not to go down there!
80	Joey	 Well he made Rachel cry!
81	Monica	 Rachel always cries!
82	Rachel	 That’s not true! (Starts to cry.)
83	Monica	 Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!
84	Joey	 All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
85	Rachel	 Go!!
86	Joey	 All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)
