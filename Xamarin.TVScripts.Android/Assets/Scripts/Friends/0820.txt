2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Phoebe are preparing for Rachel’s baby shower.]
3	Rachel	 (entering) Hi!
4	Monica	 Hey!
5	Phoebe	 Hey!
6	Rachel	 So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?
7	Phoebe	 About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
8	Monica	 Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
9	Rachel	 What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.
10	Monica	 Oh my God, your mother!
11	Rachel	 What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!
12	Monica	 Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
13	Rachel	 My God!
14	Monica	 Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
15	Phoebe	 Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…
16	Monica	 (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
17	Rachel	 So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
18	Phoebe	 No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
19	Monica	 Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.
20	Rachel	 Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!
21	Phoebe	 I know. I know, what’s her number?
22	Rachel	 I don’t know.
23	Monica	 Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.
24	Mrs. Green	 Oh, hello Monica.
25	Monica	 (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
26	Mrs. Green	 I know, my daughter’s told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
27	Monica	 Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.
28	Mrs. Green	 For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
29	Monica	 (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please! Can you come? It’s today at four.
30	Mrs. Green	 Well all right. I’ll see you at four.
31	Monica	 Thank you. (Hangs up.)
32	Phoebe	 Isn’t it at three?
33	Monica	 Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
34		Opening Credits
35	[Scene	 Joey's Apartment, Joey is reading a script as Ross and Chandler enter carrying a basketball.]
36	Chandler	 Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
37	Joey	 Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
38	Ross	 Oh cool!
39	Chandler	 That’s great.
40	Joey	 Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I’ll be (In an announcer’s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!
41	Chandler	 You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
42	Joey	 But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.
43	Ross	 Well do you want some help?
44	Joey	 Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
45	Ross	 Awesome!
46	Chandler	 Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
47	Joey	 (announcer voice) All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!
48	Chandler	 Bamboozled?
49	Joey	 Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?
50	Ross	 (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
51	Chandler	 (simultaneously with Ross) No!
52	Joey	 All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?
53	Ross	 Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…
54	Joey	 I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
55	Chandler	 Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
56	Joey	 Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
57	Chandler	 Bogota.
58	Joey	 It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
59	Chandler	 What does a Wicked Wango card do?
60	Joey	 I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
61	Chandler	 Higher or lower than what?
62	Joey	 This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)
63	Chandler	 (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
64	Ross	 I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
65	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Rachel’s baby shower is underway. Monica and Phoebe are working in the kitchen.]
66	Phoebe	 Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?
67	Monica	 You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
68	Phoebe	 What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!
69	Monica	 Hi!
70	Phoebe	 I’m so glad you could make it.
71	Monica	 Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
72	Mrs. Green	 Try. There’s my little girl. (Goes over to Rachel.)
73	Monica	 She’s still mad.
74	Phoebe	 Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
75	Monica	 Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?
76	Phoebe	 No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
77	Monica	 Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
78		[Cut to Rachel and Mrs. Green.]
79	Mrs. Green	 Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn’t know better I’d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let’s get some tea.
80	Rachel	 Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
81	Mrs. Green	 Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would just split her focus.
82	Rachel	 Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.
83	Mrs. Green	 It’s like you’re a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don’t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
84	Rachel	 Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’s crazy.)
85	Mrs. Green	 Such a sweet woman.
86	Rachel	 Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.
87	Mrs. Green	 Oh Rachel!
88	Rachel	 What?
89	Mrs. Green	 I just had the greatest idea! I’m gonna come live with you!
90	Rachel	 Wh-wh-what? What?
91	Mrs. Green	 Oh, I’m so happy I’m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
92	Rachel	 Yes. Yes I do.
93	[Scene	 Joey's Apartment, the guys are still playing Bamboozled.]
94	Joey	 All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
95	Ross	 The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.
96	Joey	 Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
97	Ross	 It’s okay, I’m ready.
98	Joey	 No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.
99	Chandler	 This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath… (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
100	Joey	 Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
101	Chandler	 Let me see that.
102	Joey	 This one right here. (Ross whines.)
103	Chandler	 Triscadecaphobia.
104	Ross	 (exhaling) The fear of Triscuts!
105	Joey	 No! No, fear of the number 13.
106	Chandler	 Fear of Triscuts?
107	Ross	 It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.
108	Joey	 All right Chandler, you’re up.
109	Ross	 Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
110	Chandler	 This game makes no sense!
111	Ross	 Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
112	Chandler	 Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.
113	Joey	 All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
114	Chandler	 Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
115	Joey	 You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
116	Chandler	 Either, it makes no difference.
117	Joey	 Choose, you jackass!
118	Chandler	 I’ll take a card.
119	Joey	 Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!
120	Ross	 What?!
121	Chandler	 This game is kinda fun.
122	Ross	 (To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
123	Chandler	 I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
124	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, the baby shower is continuing as Rachel walks over to Monica and Phoebe.]
125	Rachel	 Why did you invite my mother?!
126	Monica	 What?
127	Rachel	 She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
128	Phoebe	 For how long?
129	Rachel	 Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
130	Monica	 I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
131	Phoebe	 She can’t hear you.
132	Rachel	 What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
133	Phoebe	 Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
134	Rachel	 You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
135	Monica	 That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
136	Rachel	 Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
137	Monica	 (To Phoebe) This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
138	Phoebe	 I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!
139	Monica	 Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!
140	Mrs. Green	 Well uh, I don’t have a gift because I wasn’t invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone’s attention.
141	Phoebe	 How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!
142		(Mrs. Green goes into the kitchen and Rachel follows her.)
143	Rachel	 Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!
144	Mrs. Green	 Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
145	Rachel	 Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
146	Mrs. Green	 Sweetheart I know you’re gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
147	Rachel	 But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.
148	Mrs. Green	 Really? Remember Twinkles?
149	Rachel	 He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
150	Phoebe	 Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.
151	Mrs. Green	 Oh look.
152	Rachel	 Wow!
153	Phoebe	 Okay, this is from your friend at work.
154	Rachel	 Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She’s holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
155	Mrs. Green	 Darling, that’s a breast pump!
156	Rachel	 Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?
157	Woman	 It’s a diaper genie.
158	Rachel	 Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
159	Woman	 No! It’s where you put the dirty ones!
160	Rachel	 Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
161	Mrs. Green	 Oh you’re gonna do that ten times a day?
162	Rachel	 What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
163	Mrs. Green	 No dear, that’s what babies do.
164	Monica	 Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
165	Mrs. Green	 Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you’re trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
166	Rachel	 I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone gasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!
167	Mrs. Green	 You can’t leave a baby alone!
168	Rachel	 Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
169	Woman	 It’s actually a bassinet.
170	Rachel	 Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)
171		Commercial Break
172	[Scene	 Joey's Apartment, the guys are still playing the game only everyone is really into it.]
173	Joey	 (To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!"
174	Chandler	 Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
175	Joey	 Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!
176	Chandler	 Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
177	Joey	 Yes!
178	Chandler	 I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
179	Joey	 Wise choice, how many rungs?
180	Chandler	 Six!
181	Joey	 (makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.
182	Chandler	 (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
183	Ross	 (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I’d like a Wicked Wango card!
184	Joey	 Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song. (Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)
185	Ross	 (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
186	Chandler	 Tell it to the Time Turtle!
187	Ross	 Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
188	Joey	 Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!
189	Ross	 I’d like to spin the wheel!
190		(Joey makes a sound like a game show wheel spinning with the pointer bouncing off of the bars on the wheel as it slows and comes to a stop.)
191	Chandler	 (annoyed) Oh come on!!
192	Joey	 All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
193	Ross	 Is there a hopping bonus?
194	Joey	 Of course!
195		(Ross gets up and starts to hop on one leg.)
196	Joey	 Who invented bifocals?
197	Ross	 Ben Franklin.
198	Joey	 Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
199	Ross	 Queen Victoria.
200	Joey	 Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
201	Ross	 Noooo!!! Every time!!!
202	Joey	 Now, over to Chandler.
203	Chandler	 I’d like a Google Card.
204	Joey	 Are you sure?
205	Chandler	 Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
206	Joey	 Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!
207	Chandler	 Nooo!!
208	Ross	 Yeah!!
209	Chandler	 This is the best game ever!!!
210	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, the baby shower has ended and everyone except for Mrs. Green have left who is talking to Rachel while Monica and Phoebe are cleaning up.]
211	Rachel	 So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
212	Mrs. Green	 Of course I am!
213	Rachel	 Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
214	Mrs. Green	 No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine. (Starts to get up.)
215	Rachel	 Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
216	Mrs. Green	 I’m going to the bathroom.
217	Rachel	 Okay.
218	Mrs. Green	 Now don’t worry! Everything’s gonna be okay. (Hugs Rachel while she is standing and Rachel is sitting, seeing this Monica decides to join in on the hugging by hugging Mrs. Green from behind her back.)
219	Monica	 It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.
220	Ross	 (entering, out of breath) Hey!
221	Phoebe	 Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
222	Ross	 I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
223	Phoebe	 Not if you were here.
224	Ross	 Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
225	Rachel	 Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
226	Ross	 (excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
227	Rachel	 No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.
228	Ross	 Uh, what?
229	Rachel	 Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn’t happy.)
230	Ross	 What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
231	Mrs. Green	 (entering from bathroom) Hi Ross!
232	Ross	 Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
233	[Scene	 Joey’s Audition, Joey is being shown in.]
234	Man	 Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.
235	Joey	 (announcer voice) It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.
236	Ray	 And this is Duncan (points to the cameraman) and Erin, they’re gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let’s get the camera rolling.
237	Joey	 (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!
238	Ray	 Whenever you’re ready.
239	Joey	 (to the camera) Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
240	Erin	 Wayne Gretzky.
241	Joey	 Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
242	Ray	 Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules? We’ve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
243	Joey	 What—Why?!
244	Ray	 Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn’t follow it.
245	Joey	 Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!
246	Ray	 Yeah all that’s gone. It’s basically just a simple question and answer game now.
247	Joey	 Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?
248	Ray	 Well, there’ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
249	Joey	 (announcer voice to the camera) Let’s play Bamboozled!
250	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Mrs. Green is telling Ross what needs to be done to baby proof his apartment.]
251	Mrs. Green	 …and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
252	Ross	 Well we…we don’t have a garage.
253	Mrs. Green	 Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
254	Ross	 Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
255	Mrs. Green	 Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
256	Rachel	 I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
257	Ross	 I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
258	Rachel	 Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
259	Phoebe	 No, not a thing.
260	Monica	 It’s frightening.
261	Ross	 Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
262	Mrs. Green	 That’s true. You do have another child.
263	Ross	 Yeah.
264	Mrs. Green	 With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
265	Ross	 That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
266	Mrs. Green	 Well then you really don’t need me to live with you.
267	Ross	 Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.
268	Mrs. Green	 You’re gonna be a great father.
269	Ross	 Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
270	Rachel	 Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
271	Ross	 Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?
272	Rachel	 I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
273	Ross	 Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.
274	Rachel	 Really?
275	Ross	 I’m telling you.
276	Rachel	 Thank you. (Hugs him.)
277	Mrs. Green	 All right you two, I’m gonna get going.
278	Ross	 Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
279	Mrs. Green	 Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.
280	Monica	 (laughs) You’re still so funny. You’re so funny. (To Phoebe) What do I do?
281	Phoebe	 Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.
282	Monica	 Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.
283	Phoebe	 Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.
284	Monica	 Really?
285	Phoebe	 Uh-huh!
286	Monica	 Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!
287	Mrs. Green	 Spiteful?!
288	Monica	 That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!
289	Phoebe	 (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…
290	Monica	 So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned Mrs. Green.) I can’t feel my legs!
291	Phoebe	 You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
292	Monica	 Yeah? I’m proud of me too.
293	Phoebe	 You should be!
294	Monica	 Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
295	Phoebe	 You got it!
296	Monica	 Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs. Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—(She trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!
297		Closing Credits
298	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's, Ross is helping Rachel study for when the baby comes.]
299	Rachel	 (closing a book) Okay! I’m ready.
300	Ross	 You sure?
301	Rachel	 Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.
302	Ross	 All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
303	Rachel	 Uh, put your elbow in it.
304	Ross	 Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
305	Rachel	 Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
306	Ross	 That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
307	Rachel	 Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!
308	Ross	 Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
309	Rachel	 A card! A card! I pick a card!
310	Ross	 Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)
