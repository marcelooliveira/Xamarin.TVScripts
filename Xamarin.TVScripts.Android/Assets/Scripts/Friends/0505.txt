3	Monica	 (quietly) Hi!
4	Chandler	 (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
5		(Joey enters and Chandler pushes her away.)
6	Joey	 Monica? What time is it?
7	Chandler	 Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
8	Joey	 But it's dark out.
9	Monica	 Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
10	Joey	 I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the bathroom.)
11	Monica	 I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
12	Chandler	 I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
13	Monica	 All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
14	Chandler	 Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
15	Monica	 Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
16	Chandler	 Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
17	Monica	 Wait! What about Joey?
18		(Chandler opens the bathroom door to reveal Joey passed out on the toilet with a toothbrush in his mouth.)
19		Opening Credits
20	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are eating breakfast.]
21	Monica	 (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
22	Phoebe	 Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
23	Monica	 Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
24	Chandler	 I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
25	Ross	 (entering) Hey.
26	Joey	 Hey!
27	Monica	 Hey.
28	Ross	 Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
29	Monica	 No, she's out shopping.
30	Ross	 Damn!
31	Chandler	 What's going on?
32	Ross	 I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
33	Phoebe	 Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
34	Ross	 Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)
35	Monica	 Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
36	Ross	 I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
37		(They all reflect briefly on what was said.)
38	Joey	 Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…
39	Rachel	 (entering) Hi, guys!
40	Joey	 Hi!
41	Chandler	 Uh, hey!
42	Rachel	 What's going on?
43	Chandler	 We're flipping Monica's mattress.
44	Joey	 So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
45	Phoebe	 Yeah that's better than my way.
46		(They all agree and head to Monica's room.)
47	Rachel	 Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
48	Chandler	 Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
49	Rachel	 (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.
50	Ross	 So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
51	Rachel	 Oh yeah! I know.
52		[Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler is trying to listen through the door.]
53	Phoebe	 (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
54	Chandler	 Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
55		(Joey is bent over at the waist and is looking for something under Monica's bed.)
56	Monica	 Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
57	Joey	 (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
58	Monica	 Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…
59	Phoebe	 Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)
60	Chandler	 Condoms?
61	Joey	 You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
62	Chandler	 And condoms are the way to do that?
63		[Cut to the living room.]
64	Ross	 Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…
65	Rachel	 (interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!
66	Ross	 What?!
67	Rachel	 Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
68	Ross	 Le Poo's still alive?!
69	Rachel	 Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh my God.
70	Monica	 Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
71	Rachel	 It's Le Poo.
72	Phoebe	 I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
73	[Scene	 Atlantic City, New Jersey, Chandler and Monica are about to start their weekend of sex, sex, nothing but sex.]
74	Chandler	 (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
75	Monica	 Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
76	Chandler	 Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
77	Monica	 Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.
78		(Goes to the bathroom and Chandler turns on the TV and finds a high-speed police chase.)
79	Chandler	 Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
80		(Monica returns, carrying a glass.)
81	Monica	 We're switching rooms.
82	Chandler	 (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
83	Monica	 No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
84	Chandler	 Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
85	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is trying to tell Rachel about Emily's ultimatum again.]
86	Ross	 Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
87	Rachel	 Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)
88	Ross	 Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!
89	Rachel	 What?
90	Ross	 You're nose is bleeding!
91	Rachel	 Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
92	Ross	 Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)
93	Rachel	 Sorry. Sorry.
94	Ross	 Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
95	Rachel	 Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
96	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's weekend, a hotel clerk is showing them their new room.]
97	Hotel Clerk	 I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
98	Chandler	 Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
99	Hotel Clerk	 (watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left.
100	Chandler	 Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
101	Monica	 We're switching rooms again.
102	Chandler	 What? Why?
103	Monica	 This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
104	Hotel Clerk	 Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
105	Monica	 (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
106	Chandler	 Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
107	Monica	 Chandler!
108	Chandler	 (turning to face her) Yeah.
109	Monica	 Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
110	Chandler	 I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
111		[Time lapse, Monica and Chandler have changed rooms yet again.]
112	Monica	 Okay, this one I like!
113	Chandler	 (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
114	Monica	 Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
115	Chandler	 Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
116	Monica	 Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
117	Chandler	 Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
118	Monica	 I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
119	Chandler	 Do not speak ill of the dead.
120	Monica	 We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
121	Chandler	 I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
122	Monica	 What did you say?
123	Chandler	 I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
124	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading a magazine and has two tissues stuck up her nose in an attempt to stop the bleeding and as she hears Ross enter, she quickly hides her face behind the magazine and removes the tissues.]
125	Rachel	 Hi!
126	Ross	 Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
127	Rachel	 Okay, what's up?
128	Ross	 Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
129	Rachel	 Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
130	Ross	 And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…
131	Rachel	 Yeah?
132	Ross	 …is for me not to see you anymore.
133	Rachel	 That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause) (Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
134	Ross	 It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
135	Rachel	 Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
136	Ross	 You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
137	Rachel	 Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
138	Ross	 What are you doing?
139	Rachel	 Storming out!
140	Ross	 Rachel, this is your apartment.
141	Rachel	 Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
142		Commercial Break
143	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is returning from his disastrous weekend. He throws his bag down and sits down on one of the leather chairs, but he sits on something and picks it up and throws it away.]
144	Chandler	 Damn Rollos!
145	Joey	 Hey, you're back!
146	Chandler	 Hey.
147	Joey	 How was your conference?
148	Chandler	 It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
149	Joey	 Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
150	Chandler	 Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
151	Monica	 (entering) Hi!
152	Joey	 Hey, you're back too!
153	Monica	 Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
154	Joey	 Hey, how was your chef thing?
155	Monica	 Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
156	Chandler	 Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
157	Monica	 Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)
158	Chandler	 Monica. (Follows her out.)
159		[In the hall.]
160	Monica	 Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
161	Chandler	 Okay, fine, $300.
162	Monica	 300 dollars?!
163	Chandler	 Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
164	Monica	 Urghh!!
165	Joey	 (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?
166	Monica	 Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
167	Joey	 Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
168	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is drinking some Alka-Seltzer. The rest of the gang, minus Rachel is there as well.]
169	Ross	 You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
170	Joey	 You want my advice?
171	Ross	 Yes! Please!
172	Joey	 You're not gonna like it.
173	Ross	 That's okay.
174	Joey	 You got married to fast.
175	Ross	 That's not advice!
176	Joey	 I told ya.
177	Ross	 I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
178	Joey	 Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
179	Chandler and Phoebe	 Yeah, me either.
180	Monica	 Maybe I could do it.
181	Rachel	 (entering) Hi!
182	Joey	 Hi, Rach.
183	Chandler	 Hi!
184	Phoebe	 Hey.
185	Monica	 Hey.
186	Rachel	 Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
187	Joey	 I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. (Points over his shoulder.)
188	Rachel	 That's not Ross!
189	Phoebe	 Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
190	Chandler	 Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
191	Rachel	 Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
192	Joey	 Hey, you're not Kip!
193	Rachel	 (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?
194	Joey	 Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
195	Chandler	 Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
196	Joey	 Oh, that poor bastard.
197	Rachel	 See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
198	Monica	 You're not gonna be phased out!
199	Rachel	 Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
200	Phoebe	 Ehh!!
201	Rachel	 Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
202	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]
203	Chandler	 (entering) Hey!
204	Joey	 Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
205	Chandler	 Yes that was mine.
206	Joey	 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
207	Chandler	 Yes that would have made more sense.
208	Joey	 Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
209	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on couch and Rachel is getting some coffee. Phoebe keeps turning her head from to keep from looking at Rachel.]
210	Rachel	 Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!
211	Phoebe	 Come where?
212	Rachel	 Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
213	Phoebe	 Okay, but try and get Joey too.
214	Ross	 (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
215	Phoebe	 Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his back.) Forever.
216	Ross	 Hi.
217	Rachel	 Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
218	Ross	 I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
219	Rachel	 Oh, Ross…
220	Ross	 No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
221	Rachel	 No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
222	Ross	 Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
223	Rachel	 Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
224	Ross	 I can't believe this is happening.
225	Rachel	 I know.
226	Ross	 I am so sorry.
227	Rachel	 I know that too.
228	Joey	 (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
229	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is doing a crossword puzzle.]
230	Chandler	 (entering) Hey!
231	Monica	 Hi.
232	Chandler	 I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
233	Monica	 Yeah, it did.
234	Chandler	 So, I guess this is over.
235	Monica	 What?
236	Chandler	 Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
237	Monica	 Why, exactly?
238	Chandler	 Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
239	Monica	 Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something there.)
240	Chandler	 So, this isn't over?
241	Monica	 (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
242	Chandler	 Really? Okay. Great!
243	Monica	 Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)
244	Chandler	 (stops her) We're in a relationship?
245	Monica	 I'm afraid so.
246	Chandler	 Okay.
247		(They kiss.)
248	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are there as Phoebe enters.]
249	Phoebe	 Hey!
250	Monica	 Hey!
251	Phoebe	 Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
252	Monica	 Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
253		(Joey thinks that sounds familiar, but dismisses the thought.)
254	Monica	 Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
255	Rachel	 Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)
256		(Joey puts two and two together.)
257	Joey	 (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
258	Chandler	 Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
259	Joey	 Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
260		(Chandler pushes him through the door and Monica closes it behind them.)
261		[Cut to Monica's room, Chandler tackles Joey onto her bed and tries to cover his mouth.]
262	Joey	 Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
263	Chandler	 Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
264	Joey	 (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
265	Monica	 Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
266	Joey	 How?! When?!
267	Chandler	 It happened in London.
268	Joey	 IN LONDON!!!
269	Chandler	 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
270	Joey	 But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
271		(They both grab him and stop him.)
272	Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
273	Monica	 Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
274		(Joey thinks it over.)
275	Joey	 All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…
276	Monica	 I know, it's great!
277		(She goes over and kisses Chandler.)
278	Joey	 Aww, I don't want to see that!
279		[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel.]
280	Phoebe	 We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
281		Ending Credits
282	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Ross are playing Madlibs. Phoebe is reading hers.]
283	Phoebe	 The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
284	Monica	 Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
285	Phoebe	 Count for what?
286	Monica	 Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
287		(They putting their notepads down and get up to leave.)
288	Joey	 I guess I'm done.
289	Chandler	 Fun's over!
290	Monica	 Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
291	Rachel	 Uh-huh!
292	Joey	 I think I'm gonna take-off.
293	Monica	 Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)
