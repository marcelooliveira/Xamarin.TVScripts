3		[A montage of scenes from The One Where Ross and Rachel Take A Break follows.]
4	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]
5	Ross	 I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
6	Rachel	 You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?
7	Ross	 Is this about Mark?
8	Rachel	 (shocked) Oh my God.
9	Ross	 Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
10	Rachel	 Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
11	Ross	 Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)
12	Rachel	 No. A break from us.
13		(Ross looks at her, then leaves slamming the door behind him.)
14	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]
15	Rachel	 Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.
16	Ross	 (on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
17	Mark	 Hey, what do you want to drink?
18	Ross	 Who’s that?
19	Rachel	 Nobody.
20	Ross	 Is that Mark?
21	Rachel	 Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
22	Ross	 Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
23	[Scene	 The Philly.]
24	Chloe	 Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay.
25		[Cut to Chloe and Ross dancing, and their kiss.]
26		The Next Morning
27	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is making a fruit drink in the blender, Rachel has just finished her shower and is coming out of the bathroom.]
28	Monica	 Hey.
29	Rachel	 Hey.
30	Monica	 How’s the big anniversary dinner?
31	Rachel	 Well, we never actually got to dinner.
32	Monica	 Ohhh, nice.
33	Rachel	 No, we kinda broke up instead.
34	Monica	 What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)
35	Rachel	 (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.
36	Monica	 That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!
37	Rachel	 Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
38	Monica	 Oh no!!
39	Rachel	 No.
40	Monica	 Rachel, you and Mark?!
41	Rachel	 No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
42	[Scene	 Ross’s Bedroom, Ross is waking up. He straightens himself out on the bed and puts the covers over his head.]
43	Chloe	 (entering from bathroom) Morning!
44		(Ross sits bolt upright, without moving the covers.)
45		Opening Credits
46	[Scene	 Ross’s Kitchen, Ross is taking some aspirin and checking his messages.]
47	Rachel	 (on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
48	Ross	 Yeah!!
49	Rachel	 Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.
50	Ross	 Na-huh.
51	Rachel	 So, I love you.
52	Ross	 I love you.
53	Rachel	 And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8
54	Ross	 Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
55	Rachel	 Bye.
56	(Ross finds a clock, sees it’s almost 8	30, and silently screams.)
57	Ross	 Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!
58	Chloe	 (entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
59	Ross	 Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?
60	Chloe	 But my apartment is so...
61	Ross	 Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!
62	Chloe	 Wait! Where’s my shoes?
63	Ross	 You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)
64	Chloe	 Do I know why we’re rushing?
65	Ross	 Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
66	Chloe	 That’s so great for you guys!
67	Ross	 Yeah!
68	Chloe	 You must be so happy!
69	Ross	 Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up her coat)
70	Chloe	 Good luck, with your girlfriend.
71	Ross	 Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!
72	Rachel	 Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
73	Ross	 Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
74	Rachel	 So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
75	Ross	 Yes, you can, very much.
76		(Chloe gives Ross the thumbs up while still standing behind the door.)
77	Ross	 (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
78	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering carry a large box, Monica is mopping the ceiling.]
79	Phoebe	 Hey!
80	Monica	 Hey.
81	Phoebe	 Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
82	Monica	 Oh, there’s banana on it.
83	Phoebe	 Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
84	Monica	 So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
85	Phoebe	 The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
86	Monica	 Oh, good. Thanks.
87	Phoebe	 Now what is Fabutec?
88	Monica	 Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
89	Phoebe	 Waxine!!
90	Monica	 Yes! Have you seen it?
91	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
92	Monica	 I know!!
93	Phoebe	 God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?
94	Monica	 Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
95	Phoebe	 They have the best stuff in there.
96	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.]
97	Chandler	 Oh my God! Oh my God!
98	Joey	 Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
99	Ross	 You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.
100	Chandler	 Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
101	Ross	 What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
102	Joey	 Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.
103	Chandler	 He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.
104	Joey	 Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.
105	Ross	 Yeah, but don’t you think....
106	Chandler	 All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.
107	Ross	 Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)
108	Joey	 All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?
109	Ross	 What trail?
110	Joey	 (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
111	Ross	 Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.
112	Chandler	 Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!
113	[Scene	 Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.]
114	Phoebe	 (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
115	Monica	 Did that!
116	Phoebe	 Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
117	Monica	 Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
118	Phoebe	 Was it not pain-free?
119	Monica	 No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
120	Phoebe	 Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.
121	Monica	 That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.
122	Phoebe	 (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
123	Monica	 Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?
124	[Scene	 The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]
125	Ross	 (entering) Chloe? Hi..
126	Chloe	 Is this about me taking your watch?
127	Ross	 You took my watch?
128	Chloe	 I’m sorry, I do that.
129	Ross	 Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
130	Chloe	 Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.
131	Ross	 Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?
132	Chloe	 Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
133	Ross	 You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...
134	Issac	 You dog!
135	Ross	 Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
136	Issac	 Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
137	Ross	 Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.
138	Issac	 Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
139	Ross	 Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
140	Issac	 Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.
141	Ross	 Actually, no, we’re not.
142	Issac	 Yeah, we are.
143	Ross	 No, we’re not.
144	Issac	 Yeah, we are.
145	Ross	 No, we’re not!!
146	Issac	 Okay, we’re not.
147	Ross	 Right.
148	Issac	 But, we are.
149	Ross	 Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.
150	Issac	 I can promise not to tell her again.
151	[Scene	 Phoebe’s Work, Ross is now trying to stop Jasmine from telling Phoebe.]
152	Ross	 (entering out of breath) Jasmine?
153	Jasmine	 Uh-huh.
154	Ross	 We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.
155	Jasmine	 You did a bad thing!
156	Ross	 Yes, I did.
157	Jasmine	 Very bad!
158	Ross	 Very bad.
159	Jasmine	 Very, very bad.
160	Ross	 I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
161	Jasmine	 No.
162	Ross	 Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
163	Jasmine	 All right.
164	Ross	 Thank you, thank you.
165	Jasmine	 But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
166	Ross	 (angrily) Who’s your roommate?
167	[Scene	 Central Perk, Gunther is wiping down the counter as Ross rushes in.]
168	Ross	 Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
169	Gunther	 I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?
170		(Ross turns around and sees Rachel sitting by the window. She is just glaring at him.)
171		Commercial Break
172	[Scene	 Monica’s Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are removing the rest of their wax strips.]
173	Monica	 Ow!
174	Phoebe	 Oh!!
175	Monica	 Ow!! Ow!!
176	Phoebe	 Ow!!!
177	Monica and Phoebe	 Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
178		(Hearing the screaming Chandler and Joey rush in. Joey has a pan, Chandler has a tea kettle.)
179	Phoebe	 We’re all right.
180	Monica	 It’s okay, it’s okay.
181	Phoebe	 We’re all right.
182	Monica	 We were just waxing our legs.
183	Chandler	 Off?!!
184	Phoebe	 For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
185	Chandler	 Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
186	Joey	 Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.
187	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)
188	Chandler	 Oh, that’s mature.
189	Joey	 Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
190	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
191	Monica	 That’s right.
192		(Joey laughs, pulls it off, then does a high-pitched whine.)
193		[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is trying to close the door on Ross.]
194	Ross	 (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
195		[Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler slowly closes the door, and we hear Rachel from the living room.]
196	Rachel	 I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!
197	Monica	 What?
198	Chandler	 Nothing, nothing.
199	Monica	 (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
200	Phoebe	 (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?
201	Ross	 Rachel?
202		[Cut to Living Room]
203	Rachel	 Just get away from me!
204	Ross	 No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
205	Rachel	 A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
206		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
207	Phoebe	 Whe-where did he put it?!
208		[Cut to Living Room]
209	Rachel	 Ross, you had sex with another woman!
210		[Cut to Monica's bedroom, both Monica and Phoebe gasp.]
211	Monica	 Oh my God.
212	Phoebe	 Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
213	Chandler	 Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
214	Monica	 Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!
215	Chandler	 (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
216		[Cut to Living Room]
217	Rachel	 (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
218	Ross	 No!!
219	Rachel	 Just get out! Now!!
220	Ross	 No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
221	Rachel	 Okay! All right! How was she?
222		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
223	Chandler	 Uh-oh.
224		[Cut to Living Room]
225	Ross	 What?
226	Rachel	 Was she good?
227		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
228	Joey	 Don’t answer that.
229		[Cut to Living Room]
230	Rachel	 Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?
231	Ross	 She was...
232		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
233	Joey	 Awful! Horrible!
234	Chandler	 She was not good. Not good.
235	Joey	 She was nothing compared to you.
236		[Cut to Living Room]
237	Ross	 She, she was different.
238		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
239	Joey	 Ewwwww!
240	Chandler	 Uh-oh.
241		[Cut to Living Room]
242	Rachel	 Good different?
243	Ross	 Nobody likes change.
244		(Rachel picks up a newspaper and starts beating him with it.)
245	Ross	 What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
246		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
247	Phoebe	 Should we do something?
248	Chandler	 Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
249		[Cut to Living Room]
250	Ross	 I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
251	Rachel	 Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
252		(Ross hands Rachel back the newspaper, and she starts beating him with it again.)
253	Ross	 Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
254	Rachel	 And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
255		(She throws the paper at him, misses and hits Monica’s door, they all jump back at the sound.)
256	Ross	 Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
257	Rachel	 We were on a break!
258	Ross	 That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
259	Rachel	 You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
260	Ross	 Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
261	Rachel	 Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
262		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
263	Joey	 Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)
264	Monica	 (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.
265	Joey	 Why not?! (to Chandler) I’m hungry.
266	Monica	 Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.
267		[Cut to Living Room]
268	Rachel	 God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
269	Ross	 Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
270	Rachel	 Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.
271		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
272	Chandler	 Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
273	Joey	 Yeah, we’ll be fine.
274		[Cut to Living Room]
275	Ross	 Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
276		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
277	Chandler	 (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.
278		[Later, Phoebe is on the phone, they’re all still trapped in Monica’s bedroom.]
279	Phoebe	 Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9
280		[Cut to Living Room]
281	Ross	 Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
282	Rachel	 All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
283	Ross	 (pause) Yes I would.
284	Rachel	 You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
285	Ross	 (less sure) Yes.
286	Rachel	 You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
287	Ross	 (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.
288		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
289	All	 Ohhhhh!
290		[Later, Ross and Rachel are sitting in the kitchen.]
291	Ross	 What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?
292	Rachel	 I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.
293	Ross	 Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’
294		(She turns around and glares at him, he turns away.)
295		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
296	Joey	 Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
297	Phoebe	 We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
298	Chandler	 Oh great, food with hair on it.
299	Phoebe	 No, not the used wax.
300	Chandler	 Because that would be crazy?
301		[Cut to Living Room]
302	Ross	 Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.
303	Rachel	 Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.
304	Ross	 No anchovies.
305	Rachel	 With ah, extra anchovies.
306	Ross	 That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.
307	Rachel	 Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
308		[Cut to later, they are finishing up the pizza, there’s one piece left.]
309	Ross	 You can have the last piece, if you want.
310	Rachel	 Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
311	[Cut to Monica's bedroom, they’re all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe, don’t like it. Joey tries some and makes a face like	 ‘Hey, that’s not so bad.’]
312	Phoebe	 They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?
313	Chandler	 Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.
314	Monica	 What if they don’t?
315		(Long pause.)
316	Joey	 You think I need a new walk?
317	Chandler	 What?
318	Joey	 Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.
319	Chandler	 Are you actually saying these words?
320		[Later, in the living room, Rachel is sitting on the couch, Ross is on the chair.]
321	Ross	 What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!
322		[Cut to Monica's bedroom]
323	Joey	 Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) Yeah, okay.
324	Monica	 Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
325	Phoebe	 Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
326		[Cut to Living Room]
327	Ross	 Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
328	Rachel	 That’s....
329	Ross	 That’s what?!
330	Rachel	 That is neither here nor there.
331	Ross	 Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
332		(He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just before he kisses her on the lips....)
333	Rachel	 No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
334	Ross	 Okay, okay, okay.
335	Rachel	 (softly) I think you should go.
336	Ross	 What?
337	Rachel	 (softly) I really think you need to go now.
338	Ross	 (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...
339	Rachel	 Yeah, what the hell did I know!
340	Ross	 Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....
341	Rachel	 (crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.
342		[We see the rest of them are now crying.]
343	Ross	 (crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.
344		(Pause)
345	Rachel	 Then how come it is?
346		Closing Credits
347	[Scene	 Monica’s bedroom.]
348	Phoebe	 They’ve been quiet for a long time.
349	Joey	 Maybe she killed him?
350	Chandler	 Let’s go.
351		[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is sleeping on the couch, Ross is gone, the rest of them can finally emerge from their cell. They all wave good bye, and start to walk quietly out, as Monica goes and puts a blanket on Rachel. Joey starts walking all hunched over and bobbing his shoulders as he goes.]
352	Chandler	 (to Joey) Is that your new walk?
353	Joey	 (whispering) No, I really have to pee.
