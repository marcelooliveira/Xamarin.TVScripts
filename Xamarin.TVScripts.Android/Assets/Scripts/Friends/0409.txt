3	Phoebe	 Okay!
4	Monica	 Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)
5	Chandler	 Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.
6	Phoebe	 Okayyyyy, open up!
7		(They open their eyes and are stunned at the van.)
8	Ross	 What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
9	Phoebe	 Yeah, it’s for our catering business!
10	Joey	 I think I know that girl.
11	Monica	 All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.
12	Rachel	 No?
13	Phoebe	 No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
14	Rachel	 Oh!
15	Phoebe	 And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)
16	Joey	 Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all there.]
19	Monica	 (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
20	Phoebe	 Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
21	Monica	 Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
22	Monica	 Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.
23	Phoebe	 How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
24	Monica	 Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
25	All	 Yay!!
26	Phoebe	 Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.
27	Monica	 Oh.
28	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
29	Ross	 I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
30	Chandler	 No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
31	Ross	 Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
32	Chandler	 Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
33	Ross	 Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
34	Phoebe	 Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
35	Ross	 Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
36	Chandler	 I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
37	Ross	 I’m gonna call after you!
38	Chandler	 This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
39	Chandler and Ross	 Woooo!!!
40	Monica	 All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
41	Joey	 Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
42	Ross	 Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
43	Joey	 Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
44	Ross	 Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
45	Joey	 No, I had sex in high school.
46	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Rachel and Sophie are sitting at their desks working as Joanna walks in.]
47	Rachel	 Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…
48	Joanna	 (interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
49	Rachel	 Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…
50	Joanna	 Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
51	Rachel	 God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.
52	Joanna	 Really? Well, in that case…
53	Rachel	 (interrupting) And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.
54	Joanna	 That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face.
55	Rachel	 Ohh! That’s great!
56	Joanna	 You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
57	Rachel	 Really?!
58	Joanna	 No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don’t you worry, I’m sure with your qualifications you won’t need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
59	Rachel	 Well, I, umm…
60	Joanna	 Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
61	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready to party.]
62	Chandler	 Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!
63	Joey	 Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.
64	Chandler	 Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
65	Joey	 Really?!
66	Chandler	 Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.
67	Ross	 (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
68	Chandler	 It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.
69	Joey	 All right, I’ll see you guys.
70	Chandler and Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa!
71	Chandler	 Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
72	Joey	 I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
73	Ross	 Somewhere maybe along the equator?
74	Joey	 Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
75	Chandler	 (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)
76	Ross	 What happened?
77	Chandler	 He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.
78	Ross	 Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
79	Chandler	 Stupid, useless Canadian money!
80	[Scene	 Bloomingdale’s, Rachel is meeting with Mr. Posner, Mrs. Lynch, and Joanna the hiring committee.]
81	Mr. Posner	 You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
82	Rachel	 Thank you.
83	Joanna	 Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
84	Rachel	 Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
85	Mrs. Lynch	 I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
86	Rachel	 Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
87	Joanna	 Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
88	Rachel	 I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
89	Joanna	 Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can carry two things at once!
90	Mr. Posner	 Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
91	Rachel	 Yes, I realize that…
92	Joanna	 (interrupting) And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
93	Rachel	 I love working with designers!
94	Joanna	 With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?
95	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is there as Monica enters carrying a huge stack of newspapers.]
96	Monica	 Hey! My first review is out!
97	Phoebe	 Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
98	Monica	 All right, look at my on the back page.
99	Phoebe	 Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.
100	Monica	 Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.
101	Phoebe	 Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
102	Monica	 Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
103	Phoebe	 No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?
104	Monica	 Haven’t we made this decision?
105	Phoebe	 Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)
106	Monica	 Bye!
107	Phoebe	 Bye!
108		(The intercom buzzes.)
109	Monica	 (answering it) Who is it?
110	Allesandro	 It’s Allesandro, from Allesandro’s.
111	Monica	 Oh my God.
112	Allesandro	 I want to talk to you about your review.
113	Monica	 Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!
114	Allesandro	 Why? So you could hang up on me?
115	Monica	 Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
116	Allesandro	 Just give me a chance too…
117	Phoebe	 (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
118	Monica	 No! Phoebe!
119	Phoebe	 Hey, Monica!
120		Commercial Break
121	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
122	Allesandro	 (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
123	Monica	 I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.
124	Allesandro	 Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
125	Monica	 The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
126	Allesandro	 Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
127	Monica	 All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
128	Allesandro	 Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.
129	Monica	 Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
130	Allesandro	 (shyly) Lebanon.
131	Monica	 Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
132	Allesandro	 How long is this gonna take? ‘Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
133	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Rachel is confronting Joanna about her interview.]
134	Rachel	 (entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
135	Joanna	 I thought it went very well.
136	Rachel	 No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
137	Joanna	 Rachel, please, don’t make a scene.
138	Rachel	 There’s nobody here!
139	Joanna	 Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable!
140	Sophie	 She’s not making me uncomfortable.
141	Joanna	 Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)
142	Rachel	 Do you want me to quit?
143	Joanna	 What?! What would make you think that?
144	Rachel	 Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)
145	Joanna	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
146	Rachel	 What?
147	Joanna	 That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…
148	Rachel	 My drinking?
149	Joanna	 Oh, I must’ve said that after you left.
150	Rachel	 Said what? Exactly.
151	Joanna	 That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.
152	Rachel	 Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!
153	Joanna	 Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it! I don’t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
154	Rachel	 Say more things like that.
155	Joanna	 You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
156	Rachel	 I’d need an expense account.
157	Joanna	 Done!
158	Rachel	 And an assistant.
159	Joanna	 Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)
160	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are watching TV as Joey enters.]
161	Joey	 Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.
162	Ross	 It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.
163	Joey	 So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?
164	Ross	 No! I balanced my checkbook.
165	Chandler	 Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
166	Ross	 I can’t believe he didn’t come!
167	Joey	 So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
168	Chandler	 Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!
169	Ross	 Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
170	Joey	 Well, we could do that!
171	Ross	 There’s other stuff too.
172	Joey	 We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
173	Ross	 Yeah!
174	Joey	 Yeah!
175	Ross	 Yeah!!
176	Joey	 Yeah!!
177	Ross	 It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!
178	Joey	 Yeah! All right? Let’s go!
179	Chandler	 And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
180	Joey and Ross	 Yeah!!!
181	Chandler	 All right!!
182	Ross	 (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
183	Chandler	 Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
184	Ross	 Yeah.
185	Chandler	 Well, those were seals, man.
186	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is entering, excited.]
187	Rachel	 Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
188	Monica	 Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
189	Rachel	 Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!
190	Monica	 Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
191	Rachel	 Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.
192	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
193	Rachel	 Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
194	Phoebe	 Yeah.
195	Rachel	 How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?
196	Phoebe	 I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) You got the job!!
197	Rachel	 Yes!!!
198	Monica	 You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?
199	Rachel	 Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) I’m gonna have walls!
200	Phoebe	 Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
201	Monica	 Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
202	Phoebe	 But we’ve only had one job.
203	Monica	 I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?
204	Phoebe	 Yeah! What are you saying?
205	Monica	 I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.
206	Phoebe	 What?
207	Monica	 It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.
208	Phoebe	 You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!
209	Monica	 All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
210	Phoebe	 For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)
211	Monica	 Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)
212	Rachel	 I’m an assistant buyer!!
213	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Ross, and Chandler are making a pit stop on their party tour.]
214	Joey	 All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.
215	Chandler	 Yeah, all right.
216	Ross	 Okay.
217	Joey	 So, we’re having fun, right?
218	Chandler and Ross	 Yeah.
219	Joey	 We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
220	Ross	 I’m kinda beat.
221	Chandler	 Actually, me too.
222	Joey	 Are you serious?!
223	Chandler and Ross	 Yeah.
224	Joey	 Thank God! I’m exhausted!
225	Gunther	 So you guys want coffees?
226	Joey	 Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.
227	Ross	 Yeah, me too.
228	Chandler	 Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
229	Joey	 I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
230	Ross	 I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.
231		(pause)
232	Ross	 How sad are we?
233	Joey	 Yeah, I know.
234	Chandler	 Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
235	Joey and Ross	 Yeah!
236	Joey	 Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
237	Chandler and Ross	 Yeah!
238	Ross	 And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
239	Joey	 We’re 29, we’re not women.
240	[Scene	 Central Perk, the next day, Phoebe is there.]
241	Monica	 (entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.
242	Phoebe	 Okay, I’m hearing.
243	Monica	 I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
244	Phoebe	 What?!
245	Monica	 Or! A bakery delivery person.
246	Phoebe	 I wa-I wa-I wa…
247	Monica	 Pizza?!
248	Phoebe	 Monica!
249	Monica	 All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.
250	Phoebe	 No.
251	Monica	 Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.
252	Phoebe	 No.
253	Monica	 Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.
254	Phoebe	 Really?! Are you sure?
255	Monica	 Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.
256	Phoebe	 Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.
257	Monica	 Really?!
258	Phoebe	 Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.
259	Monica	 Thank you.
260	Phoebe	 Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
261	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, she is coming in for the day carrying a picture for her new office. Mrs. Lynch is coming out of Joanna’s office, carrying a box.]
262	Rachel	 Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
263	Mrs. Lynch	 Oh my goodness! You haven’t heard!
264	Rachel	 Heard what?
265	Mrs. Lynch	 Joanna passed away last night.
266	Rachel	 Oh my God! How?!
267	Mrs. Lynch	 Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
268	Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
269	Mrs. Lynch	 I know!
270	Rachel	 Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.
271	Mrs. Lynch	 I didn’t realize that she was so close.
272	Rachel	 Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.
273	Mrs. Lynch	 No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
274	Rachel	 Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?
275	Mrs. Lynch	 (starting to cry) No, I’m sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as Sophie arrives.)
276	Sophie	 (happily) Good morning!
277	Rachel	 Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…
278	Sophie	 I sure did! (smiles)
279		Closing Credits
280	[Scene	 Monica’s new kitchen, Allesandro is introducing her to her new employees.]
281	Allesandro	 I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
282	Monica	 Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
