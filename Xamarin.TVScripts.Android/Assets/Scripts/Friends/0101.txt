2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]
3	Monica	 There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
4	Joey	 C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
5	Chandler	 All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
6	Phoebe	 Wait, does he eat chalk?
7		(They all stare, bemused.)
8	Phoebe	 Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
9	Monica	 Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
10	Chandler	 Sounds like a date to me.
11		[Time Lapse]
12	Chandler	 Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
13	All	 Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
14	Chandler	 Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
15	Joey	 Instead of...?
16	Chandler	 That's right.
17	Joey	 Never had that dream.
18	Phoebe	 No.
19	Chandler	 All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
20	Monica	 And they weren't looking at you before?!
21	Chandler	 Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
22		[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]
23	Ross	 (mortified) Hi.
24	Joey	 This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
25	Monica	 Are you okay, sweetie?
26	Ross	 I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
27	Chandler	 Cookie?
28	Monica	 (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
29	Joey	 Ohh.
30	Monica	 (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
31	Ross	 Thanks.
32	Phoebe	 Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
33	Ross	 No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
34	Phoebe	 Fine! Be murky!
35	Ross	 I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
36	Monica	 No you don't.
37	Ross	 No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
38	Joey	 And you never knew she was a lesbian...
39	Ross	 No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
40	Chandler	 Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
41	Ross	 I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
42	Monica	 Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3
43	Ross	 Sorry.
44	Joey	 Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
45		(Ross gestures his consent.)
46	Joey	 Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
47	Ross	 I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
48		(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)
49	Chandler	 And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
50	Monica	 Rachel?!
51	Rachel	 Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
52	Waitress	 Can I get you some coffee?
53	Monica	 (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
54	Rachel	 Hi, sure!
55	Ross	 Hi.
56		(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens. He sits back down defeated again. A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)
57	Monica	 So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
58	Rachel	 Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me
59	Monica	 Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
60	Rachel	 Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene
61	Monica	 Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
62	Chandler	 (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
63	Ross	 (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.
64	Rachel	 (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
65		(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)
66	Phoebe	 If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
67	Chandler	 (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
68	Joey	 I say push her down the stairs.
69	Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey	 Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
70		(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)
71	Rachel	 C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
72	Ross	 You can see where he'd have trouble.
73	Rachel	 Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
74	Monica	 Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
75	Rachel	 Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
76		[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]
77	Monica	 Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
78	Phoebe	 (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
79	Rachel	 I'm all better now.
80	Phoebe	 (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
81	Monica	 Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
82	Joey	 (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
83	Monica	 Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
84	Joey	 What, like there's a rule or something?
85		(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)
86	Chandler	 Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
87	Paul	 (over the intercom) It's, uh, it's Paul.
88	Monica	 Oh God, is it 6
89	Joey	 Who's Paul?
90	Ross	 Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
91	Monica	 Maybe. Joey
92	Ross	 He finally asked you out?
93	Monica	 Yes!
94	Chandler	 Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
95	Monica	 Rach, wait, I can cancel...
96	Rachel	 Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
97	Monica	 (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
98	Ross	 (choked voice) That'd be good...
99	Monica	 (horrified) Really?
100	Ross	 (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
101	Phoebe	 What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)
102		(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)
103	Monica	 Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
104	All	 Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
105	Chandler	 I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
106	Monica	 Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
107	Ross	 A wandering?
108	Monica	 Change! Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
109	Phoebe	 Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
110		(Monica goes to change.)
111	Joey	 Hey, Paul!
112	Paul	 Yeah?
113	Joey	 Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
114	Monica	 (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!
115	Ross	 So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
116	Rachel	 Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
117	Ross	 Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
118	Chandler	 (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.
119	Rachel	 Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
120	Ross	 Okay, sure.
121	Joey	 Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
122	Phoebe	 Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
123		Commercial Break
124	[Scene	 The Subway, Phoebe is singing for change.]
125	Phoebe	 (singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
126	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, the guys are there assembling furniture.]
127	Ross	 (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
128		(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling the bookcase.)
129	Joey	 I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
130	Chandler	 It's a beautiful thing.
131	Joey	 (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
132	Chandler	 I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
133	Joey	 Which goes where?
134	Chandler	 I have no idea.
135		(Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a plant.)
136	Joey	 Done with the bookcase!
137	Chandler	 All finished!
138	Ross	 (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
139	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
140	Chandler	 Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
141	Joey	 Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
142	Ross	 You guys.
143	Chandler	 Oh, God.
144	Joey	 You got screwed.
145	Chandler	 Oh my God!
146	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating.]
147	Monica	 Oh my God!
148	Paul	 I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
149	Monica	 My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
150	Paul	 Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
151	Monica	 -leg?
152	Paul	 (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
153	Monica	 You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
154	Paul	 Ooh, steer clear of you.
155	Monica	 That's right. [Scene
156	Rachel	 Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
157	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture.]
158	Ross	 I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
159	Joey	 Shut up!
160	Chandler	 You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
161	Ross	 That only took me an hour.
162	Chandler	 Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
163	Ross	 You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
164	Joey	 What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
165	Ross	 I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
166	Chandler	 Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
167	Paul	 Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
168	Monica	 What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
169	Paul	 No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
170	Monica	 Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
171	Paul	 Isn't there?
172	Monica	 Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
173	Paul	 Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually.
174	Monica	 (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
175	Paul	 It's okay...
176	Monica	 I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
177	Paul	 Two years.
178	Monica	 Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
179	Paul	 So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
180	Monica	 (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
181	[Scene	 Monica's Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne Loves Chaci.]
182	Priest on TV	 We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
183	Rachel	 Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
184	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and talking.]
185	Ross	 (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
186	Joey	 Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
187	Chandler	 Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
188	Joey	 Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here. (Exits.)
189	Ross	 Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
190		[Cut to Rachel staring out of her window.]
191		Commercial Break
192	[Scene	 Monica's Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for Joey and Chandler.]
193	Rachel	 Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
194	Chandler	 That is amazing.
195	Joey	 Congratulations.
196	Rachel	 Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
197	Chandler	 If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
198	Joey	 Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
199	Monica	 (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
200	All	 Morning. Good morning.
201	Paul	 (entering from Monica's room) Morning.
202	Joey	 Morning, Paul.
203	Rachel	 Hello, Paul.
204	Chandler	 Hi, Paul, is it?
205		(Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice so the others can't hear. The others move Monica's table closer to the door so that they can.)
206	Paul	 Thank you! Thank you so much!
207	Monica	 Stop!
208	Paul	 No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
209	Monica	 We'll talk later.
210	Paul	 Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
211	Joey	 That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
212	Monica	 Shut up, and put my table back.
213	All	 Okayyy! (They do so.)
214	Chandler	 All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
215	Rachel	 So, like, you guys all have jobs?
216	Monica	 Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
217	Joey	 Yeah, I'm an actor.
218	Rachel	 Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
219	Joey	 I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
220	Monica	 Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
221	Joey	 Look, it was a job all right?
222	Chandler	 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
223	Joey	 I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
224	Chandler	 You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
225	Joey	 You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)
226	Monica	 So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
227	Rachel	 I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
228	Monica	 I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
229	Rachel	 Oh, yeah.
230	Monica	 Well, it's like that. With feelings.
231	Rachel	 Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
232	Monica	 Big time!
233	Rachel	 Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
234	Monica	 I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
235	Rachel	 Oh, look, wish me luck!
236	Monica	 What for?
237	Rachel	 I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.
238		(Monica exits.)
239	[Scene	 Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.]
240	Frannie	 Hey, Monica!
241	Monica	 Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
242	Frannie	 You had sex, didn't you?
243	Monica	 How do you do that?
244	Frannie	 Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
245	Monica	 You know Paul?
246	Frannie	 Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
247	Monica	 You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
248	Frannie	 Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
249	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
250	Joey	 (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
251	Monica	 Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
252	Ross	 I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
253	Monica	 I hate men! I hate men!
254	Phoebe	 Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
255	Monica	 Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
256	Phoebe	 All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
257	Monica	 I just thought he was nice, y'know?
258	Joey	 (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
259		(Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.)
260	Rachel	 Guess what?
261	Ross	 You got a job?
262	Rachel	 Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
263	Chandler	 And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
264	Rachel	 You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
265	Chandler	 Oh, how well you know me...
266	Rachel	 They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
267	Monica	 How'd you pay for them?
268	Rachel	 Uh, credit card.
269	Monica	 And who pays for that?
270	Rachel	 Um... my... father.
271	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table. Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]
272	Rachel	 Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
273	Monica	 C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
274	Rachel	 I know that. That's why I was getting married.
275	Phoebe	 Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
276	Rachel	 Thank you.
277	Phoebe	 You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
278		(Pause)
279	Ross	 The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
280	Monica	 All right, you ready?
281	Rachel	 No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
282	Monica	 You can, I know you can!
283	Rachel	 I don't think so.
284	Ross	 Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
285	Ross	 C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
286	All	 Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)
287	Rachel	 Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
288	Monica	 Rachel! That was a library card!
289	All	 Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
290	Chandler	 (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
291		(She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)
292	Monica	 Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
293		[Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by playing the national anthem.]
294	Monica	 Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
295	Ross	 No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
296	Monica	 You be okay?
297	Ross	 Yeah.
298	Rachel	 Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
299	Monica	 That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
300	Ross and Rachel	 Goodnight.
301		(Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)
302	Ross	 Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-
303	Rachel	 Sorry-
304	Ross	 No no no, go-
305	Rachel	 No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
306	Ross	 Split it?
307	Rachel	 Okay.
308	Ross	 Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
309	Rachel	 I knew.
310	Ross	 You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
311	Rachel	 I did.
312	Ross	 Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
313	Rachel	 Yeah, maybe...
314	Ross	 Okay... okay, maybe I will...
315	Rachel	 Goodnight.
316	Ross	 Goodnight.
317		(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.)
318	Monica	 See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
