2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to pry more information about Chandler and Monica from Joey who's sitting on the couch and busy downing a pizza.]
3	Rachel	 Come on Joey!!!
4	Joey	 Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
5	Rachel	 I can't believe you would say that!
6	Joey	 Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
7	Rachel	 No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want—I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
8	Joey	 (thinks) I don't know.
9	Rachel	 Is he romantic with her?
10	Joey	 I don't know.
11	Rachel	 Are they in love?
12	Joey	 (thinks) I don't know.
13	Rachel	 You don't know anything.
14	Joey	 Ohh, I know one thing!
15	Rachel	 What?
16	Joey	 They did it right there on the couch.
17		(He points to where she's sitting and she jumps up quickly.)
18		Opening Credits
19	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there as Ross enters.]
20	Joey	 Hey Ross!
21	Phoebe	 Hey!
22	Ross	 (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
23	All	 What? Oh!
24	Chandler	 Sorry man.
25	Gunther	 Here's your scone.
26	Ross	 Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
27	Chandler	 Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
28	Phoebe	 Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
29	Rachel	 Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.
30	Phoebe	 Exactly! Because it's in the past!
31	Joey	 (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?
32	[Scene	 Chandler's office, Monica and him are at a party his office is throwing.]
33	Monica	 Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
34	Chandler	 Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
35	Monica	 I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
36	Chandler	 I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
37	Monica	 Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)
38		(They both stand real close together.)
39	Both	 We can't do that. (They separate.)
40		(Chandler's boss (Doug) walks up.)
41	Doug	 Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
42	Chandler	 I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
43	Monica	 Hi, nice to meet you!
44	Doug	 Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
45	Kara	 Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)
46	Doug	 Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
47	Chandler	 No, sir.
48	Doug	 Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
49		(Chandler does a fake laugh.)
50	Doug	 Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler and Monica alone.)
51	Monica	 What was that?
52	Chandler	 What?
53	Monica	 That noise you just made?
54	Chandler	 Oh, that was my work laugh.
55	Monica	 Really? Your work laugh?
56	Chandler	 Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
57	Monica	 All right, check me out.
58	Chandler	 Okay.
59		(She walks up to where Doug is finishing another joke to another group.)
60	Doug	 …says $30 Father; same as in town.
61		(Monica does a fake laugh. For the laughs, you'll have to see the episode. I can't describe them.)
62	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is buying a muffin as Chandler runs in.]
63	Chandler	 Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
64	Monica	 Really?
65	Chandler	 And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
66	Monica	 Hey, I thought you already had one.
67	Chandler	 Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
68	Rachel	 Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
69	Chandler	 Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)
70	Rachel	 (To Monica) Hey!
71	Monica	 Hi!
72	Rachel	 What's up?!
73	Monica	 What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
74	Rachel	 Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
75	Monica	 Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
76	Rachel	 Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
77	Monica	 Okay. Umm…
78	Rachel	 Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
79	Monica	 Okay, what's going on with you?
80	Rachel	 Nothing! You go!
81	Monica	 Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
82	Rachel	 Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?
83	Monica	 Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
84	Rachel	 No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.
85	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe is settling a dispute between the chick and the duck.]
86		(The duck quacks.)
87	Phoebe	 Okay, then what happened?
88		(The duck flaps its wings frantically.)
89	Phoebe	 (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!
90	Ross	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
91	Phoebe	 Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!
92	Ross	 No! No! No!
93	Phoebe	 What?!
94	Ross	 I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!
95	Joey	 (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
96	Ross	 Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
97	Joey	 Really?
98	Ross	 Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
99	Joey	 Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
100	Ross	 That's okay, Joe.
101	Joey	 All right, let's go Pheebs.
102	Ross	 (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
103	[Scene	 A tennis court somewhere in the city of New York, it's the doubles match-up of a century Chandler and Monica versus Doug and Kara.]
104	Doug	 Bing!
105		(Hits the ball towards Chandler who returns it back to him. He then hits the ball at Monica who slams it and it bounces off Kara's leg.)
106	Kara	 Oww!!
107	Monica	 Game!
108	Doug	 Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.) Are you all right sweethart?
109	Kara	 (out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right.
110	Doug	 We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
111		(They both walk off the court.)
112	Monica	 Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
113	Chandler	 Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
114	Monica	 I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
115	Chandler	 Let them win one.
116	Monica	 Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
117	Chandler	 You're not even giving them a chance!
118	Monica	 They have racquets don't they?!
119	Doug	 Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
120	Chandler	 Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
121	Monica	 I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
122		(She serves to Doug who returns it to Chandler. As it bounces over his head Chandler swings and misses.)
123	Chandler	 Oopsey, missed it!
124	Monica	 I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)
125	Doug	 Nice shot.
126		(Chandler glares at her and she shrugs her shoulders. Monica serves again; and Kara returns it.)
127	Monica	 I got it!!
128		(Chandler cuts in front of her and hits the ball high and long.)
129	Chandler	 Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
130	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Chandler are returning from the game.]
131	Monica	 I can't believe you let them win!
132	Chandler	 Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
133	Monica	 I was frustrated.
134	Chandler	 It was my racquet.
135	Monica	 I was frustrated with you!
136	Chandler	 If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
137	Monica	 Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
138	Chandler	 Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
139	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, the next morning the girls are there with Joey.]
140	Monica	 I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
141	Joey	 Maybe we should check the trash chute.
142	Rachel	 Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
143	Joey	 That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
144		(Ross enters.)
145	Phoebe	 Hey!
146	Rachel	 There he is!
147	Monica	 Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!
148	Ross	 Just, y'know out.
149	Rachel	 Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
150	Phoebe	 What were you doing?
151	Ross	 I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
152	Rachel	 You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
153	Joey	 (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
154	Ross	 Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
155	Joey	 He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
156	[Suddenly the door opens and Ross's mystery girl enters. I'll give you a hint to who it is	 OH….MY….GAWD!! Uh-huh, it's Janice.]
157	Janice	 (entering) Ross you left you scarf in…(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does the laugh.)
158		(They all turn and with shocked looks on their faces stare at Ross. Ross is at a loss for words at this moment.)
159		Commercial Break
160	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, continued from earlier.]
161	Janice	 Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
162	Rachel	 Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
163	Janice	 So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
164	Phoebe	 Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
165	Janice	 Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)
166		(They all turn and glare at Ross.)
167	Ross	 Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…
168	Phoebe	 You two will have very hairy children.
169	Ross	 Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
170	Rachel	 Ross! Janice?!
171	Joey	 All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
172	Ross	 Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
173	Phoebe	 So are you actually gonna see her again?
174	Joey	 Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
175	Ross	 I am gonna see her again.
176	Joey	 Damnit Phoebe!!
177	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is going through her purse as Rachel rushes in.]
178	Rachel	 (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
179	Monica	 My turn? What-what are you talking about?
180	Rachel	 Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
181	Monica	 What?!
182	Rachel	 I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
183	Monica	 Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
184	Rachel	 Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
185	Monica	 Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big…(Thinks)…ot.
186	Rachel	 What?!
187	Monica	 Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
188	Rachel	 All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
189	Monica	 Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
190	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe and Joey are there.]
191	Joey	 All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
192	Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.
193	Joey	 All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
194	Phoebe	 Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
195	Joey	 Judge rules, no violation.
196	Phoebe	 Ohhh.
197	Ross	 (entering) Hey guys!
198	Phoebe	 Hey!
199	Joey	 Yeah!
200		(Neither of them turns around from watching the chick and the duck look for the tasty treat.)
201	Ross	 Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
202		(They both turn around.)
203	Joey	 What?!
204	Phoebe	 Are you serious?!
205	Ross	 Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
206	Phoebe	 You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…
207	Joey	 And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
208	Phoebe	 (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
209	Joey	 Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
210	Phoebe	 Ohh, tough call.
211	Joey	 Yeah.
212	[Scene	 Doug's house, Chandler, Monica, and them are just finishing dinner.]
213	Doug	 But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)
214	Kara	 So how do you kids like your coffee?
215	Monica	 Oh, none for me. Thanks.
216	Chandler	 Just a little bit of sugar.
217	Doug	 Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)
218		(Doug and Kara go get the coffee.)
219	Monica	 (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
220	Chandler	 Oh, you get used to it.
221	Monica	 Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
222	Chandler	 So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
223	Monica	 I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
224	Chandler	 Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
225	Doug	 (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?
226	Chandler	 What?
227	Doug	 The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
228	Chandler	 Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
229	Doug	 Excuse me?
230	Chandler	 Well, I just…
231	Monica	 (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
232	Chandler	 Really?
233	Monica	 Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
234	Chandler	 I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
235	Monica	 I thought you could use the help.
236	Chandler	 Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
237	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is going through the mail as Joey enters.]
238	Joey	 (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
239	Rachel	 Sure! Why?
240	Joey	 Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
241	Rachel	 What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
242		[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's apartment, Rachel enters and sneaks up to Chandler's bedroom where she overhears Chandler and Monica talking.]
243	Chandler	 (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
244	Monica	 Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
245	Chandler	 But we're not ready to tell yet!
246	Monica	 I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
247		(Rachel decides not to confront them and starts to walk out, knocking over a lamp in the process.)
248	Monica	 (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
249	Rachel	 Hey! Hi!
250	Monica	 Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
251	Rachel	 Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
252	Monica	 Okay great!
253	Rachel	 Yeah!
254	Monica	 Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
255	Rachel	 Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
256	Monica	 Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
257	Rachel	 That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
258	Monica	 Okay.
259	Rachel	 Okay.
260	Monica	 I'll get back to my new job.
261		(Pause.)
262	Rachel	 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)
263		(After she exits, Chandler enters.)
264	Chandler	 Man, she is really gullible.
265		(Monica motions that it went right over Rachel's head.)
266	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Janice are sitting on the couch.]
267	Gunther	 Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)
268	Ross	 Thanks!
269	Janice	 Actually, I should get going.
270	Ross	 Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
271	Janice	 Yes! Yes! You did!
272	Ross	 Oh…
273	Janice	 What is wrong now?!
274	Ross	 This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…
275	Janice	 I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee—ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
276	Ross	 Okay. Sometimes I feel…
277	Janice	 No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
278	Ross	 Huh?
279	Janice	 (starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
280	Ross	 Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
281	Janice	 Well yeah!!
282	Ross	 OH…MY…GOD!!
283	Janice	 Are you gonna be okay?
284	Ross	 I am now.
285	Janice	 Okay.
286		(Joey enters.)
287	Joey	 Umm, hi.
288	Janice	 Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)
289		(Joey looks at Ross with a horrified look on his face.)
290		Ending Credits
291	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is reading a magazine as Ross hands him a beer.]
292	Ross	 Dude, we got to talk.
293	Chandler	 Okay.
294	Ross	 I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?
295	Chandler	 Why would I be mad?
296	Ross	 Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
297	Chandler	 (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
298	Ross	 Okay.
299	Chandler	 I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
300	Ross	 All right.
301	Chandler	 And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!
