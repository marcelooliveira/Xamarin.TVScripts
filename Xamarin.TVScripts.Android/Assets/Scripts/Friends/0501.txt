18	Minister	 Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
19	Ross	 Yay!
20	Minister	 You may kiss the bride.
21		(He goes to kiss her, but she isn’t very receptive of the kiss. She keeps avoiding him, until Ross finally gets to kiss her on her cheek.)
22	Mrs. Geller	 (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
23		(The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily’s hand, but she snatches it away from him.)
24	Emily	 Just keep smiling.
25	Ross	 Okay.
26	Joey	 Well, that went well. Yeah.
27	Chandler	 It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.
28		(Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.)
29	Ross	 (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?
30		(Emily gives him a forearm shot across the stomach.)
31		Opening Credits
32	[Scene	 The Wedding reception, Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are standing outside the doorway.]
33	Emily	 (Yelling from inside the bathroom) You’ve spoiled everything! It’s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
34	Joey	 (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
35	Ross	 (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She’s just fixing her makeup.
36	Emily	 I hate you!!

38	Mr. Geller	 Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
39	Ross	 That’s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)

41	Mrs. Waltham	 Yes, Waltham interiors.
42	Phoebe	 (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller’s personal physician, Dr. Philange.
43	Mrs. Waltham	 Who?
44	Phoebe	 Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
45	Mrs. Waltham	 Oh my God, Phoebe.
46	Phoebe	 No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
47		(Mrs. Waltham hangs up on her.)
48	Phoebe	 Hello?
49		(Cut to Chandler and Monica at the buffet table.)
50	Chandler	 Hey.
51	Monica	 Hey.
52	Chandler	 Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
53	Monica	 I know. How could we have let this happen?
54	Chandler	 Seven times!
55	Monica	 Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…
56	Chandler	 In a foreign, romantic country…
57	Monica	 I blame London.
58	Chandler	 Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
59	Monica	 So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
60	Chandler	 Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.
61	Monica	 Only here.
62	Chandler	 Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
63	Monica	 I’ll meet you there in two minutes.
64	Chandler	 Okay!
65		(He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, Monica is about to follow him but is intercepted by Rachel.)
66	Rachel	 Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
67	Monica	 (impatiently) Now?
68	Rachel	 Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?
69	Monica	 Oh, I-I don’t know.
70	Rachel	 Monica, what should I do?
71	Monica	 Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)
72	Rachel	 What?
73	Monica	 Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)
74	Rachel	 Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
75	Monica	 Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you.
76	Rachel	 Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.
77		(Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.)
78	Mrs. Geller	 Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
79	Mr. Waltham	 (walking by) Yes.
80	Mr. Geller	 Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there’s no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
81	Joey	 Hey, what’s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he’s eating it with his hands.)
82		(Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.)
83	Monica	 Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
84	Chandler	 Forget it, that’s off.
85	Monica	 Why?!
86	Mr. Waltham	 (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes…
87		(Joey walks up to them.)
88	Monica	 Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!
89	Joey	 Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count.
90	Monica	 That’s true.
91	Chandler	 The man’s got a point.
92		(Cut to Rachel and Ross.)
93	Rachel	 Oh, hi!
94	Ross	 Hi!
95	Rachel	 Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.
96	Ross	 Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?
97	Rachel	 Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, "I take thee circus freak." Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?
98	Ross	 No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
99	Rachel	 Right…
100	Ross	 But it absolutely didn’t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn’t!! It didn’t!!
101	Joey	 (approaching) Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…
102	Ross	 (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!
103	Joey	 You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)
104	Ross	 Look, I’m sorry.
105	Joey	 Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
106	Rachel	 (laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
107	Ross	 Oh, right!
108	Rachel	 Get the hell out of there, y’know?
109		(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run over to the bathroom.)
110	Ross	 (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)
111	Rachel	 Well, look at that, same thing.
112	[Scene	 London Marriott, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.]
113	Chandler	 Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
114		(She laughs and opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on the bed.)
115	Monica	 Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
116	Chandler	 Oh, hello Rachel.
117	Rachel	 Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
118	Chandler	 Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
119	Monica	 Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?
120	Chandler	 Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.
121	Monica	 (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
122	Rachel	 Okay.
123		(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)
124	Rachel	 Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!
125	Chandler	 Oh, yay…
126	Monica	 Great…
127	Rachel	 Hi!
128	Phoebe	 Hi, so what happened?
129	Rachel	 Well, Ross said my name.
130	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.
131	Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…
132	Chandler	 (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?
133	Monica	 But my clothes are—ohh! (They both leave.)
134		(Cut to Chandler’s room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after seeing that he isn’t, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)
135	Chandler	 Wow, you look…
136	Monica	 No time for that!
137		(They both start to frantically rip each other’s clothes off, but are interrupted when Joey tries to open the door.)
138	Joey	 Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
139	Chandler	 Well, I’ve got a girl in here.
140	Joey	 No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
141	Chandler	 Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!
142	Joey	 Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
143	Chandler	 Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?
144	Monica	 Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!
145	Joey	 My Giant? I love that movie!
146	[Scene	 Ross and Emily’s room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place to do the deed.]
147	Monica	 You really think this is okay?
148	Chandler	 Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
149	Monica	 Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.
150	Chandler	 Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
151	Monica	 Okay!
152	Chandler	 Okay!
153		(They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)
154	Ross	 (entering) Emily?!
155	Chandler	 Nope, not under here!
156	Monica	 You didn’t find her?
157	Ross	 No, I’ve looked everywhere!
158	Chandler	 Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!
159	Monica	 Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
160	Chandler	 Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
161	Monica	 Or 45.
162	Chandler	 Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
163	Ross	 No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.
164	Monica	 Well, it’s getting late.
165	Chandler	 Yeah, we’re gonna go.
166	Ross	 Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
167	Monica	 Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
168	Chandler	 Yeah, it’s a very large plane.
169	Ross	 (disappointed) That’s cool.
170	Chandler	 But, we’ll stay here with you.
171	Ross	 Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.
172		(Chandler slowly takes his hand away.)
173		Commercial Break
174	[Scene	 Ross and Emily’s room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his head in Monica’s lap and his feet on Chandler’s lap. Monica and Chandler are both still awake and depressed.]
175	Chandler	 We have to leave for New York in an hour.
176	Monica	 I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?
177	Chandler	 We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.
178		(They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there’s a knock on the door that awakens him.)
179	Ross	 Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
180	Mr. Waltham	 No.
181	Mrs. Waltham	 You can forget about Emily, she’s not with us.
182	Mr. Waltham	 We’ve come for her things.
183	Ross	 Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
184	Mr. Waltham	 She’s in hiding. She’s utterly humiliated. She doesn’t want to see you ever again.
185	Mrs. Waltham	 We’re very sad that it didn’t work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you’re absolutely delicious.
186	Mr. Waltham	 Excuse me, I’m standing right here!
187	Mrs. Waltham	 Oh yes, there you are.
188	Rachel	 (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there’s a whole cart outside… (Sees the Walthams and stops.)
189	Mr. Waltham	 Goodbye Geller.
190	Ross	 Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.
191	Mr. Waltham	 All right, I’ll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!
192	Mrs. Waltham	 (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.
193	Mr. Waltham	 You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window!
194	[Scene	 A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in first class, depressed.]
195	Monica	 Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.
196	Chandler	 Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.
197	Monica	 I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?
198	Chandler	 ‘Kay!
199		(Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is startled to see Joey sitting in Monica’s seat.)
200	Joey	 Can I ask you something?
201	Chandler	 Uhh, no.
202	Joey	 Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?
203	Chandler	 No.
204	Joey	 I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?
205	Chandler	 Yes.
206	Joey	 Thanks man.
207	Chandler	 Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
208	Joey	 But what about how much taller he is than me?
209		(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.)
210	Joey	 I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
211		(Monica returns.)
212	Joey	 Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
213	Monica	 I know!
214	Joey	 Had the beef-tips, huh?
215	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is eating cereal from a bowl she has balanced on her stomach as Joey, Chandler, and Monica return.]
216	Phoebe	 Hey!
217	Chandler	 Hey!
218	Joey	 Hi!
219		(They all hug.)
220	Phoebe	 (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had sex! (They’re shocked.)
221	Chandler	 No we didn’t!
222	Phoebe	 I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.
223	Monica	 Phoebe, I did not have sex.
224	Phoebe	 This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
225	Joey	 All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
226	Phoebe	 Oh, me too!
227	Joey	 Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?
228	Phoebe	 Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.
229		(She grabs her bag and leaves, Joey moves a little quicker to his apartment, leaving Monica and Chandler alone.)
230	Monica	 Well, we certainly are alone.
231	Chandler	 Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.
232	Monica	 Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…
233	Chandler	 Right.
234	Monica	 Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.
235	Chandler	 Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?
236	Monica	 (laughs) That’s okay.
237	Chandler	 And I’m cute too.
238	Monica	 And you’re cute too.
239	Chandler	 Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.
240	Monica	 Okay.
241	Chandler	 Bye.
242		(After he closes the door, Monica starts to follow him, but thinks better of it and stops.)
243	Chandler	 (entering) I’m still on London time, does that count?
244	Monica	 That counts!
245	Chandler	 Oh, good! (They start kissing.)
246	[Scene	 An airport in London, Ross is waiting for Emily to show up to go on their honeymoon and sees Rachel walking past.]
247	Ross	 Rach! Rach!
248	Rachel	 (she stops and turns) Hi!
249	Ross	 Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
250	Rachel	 Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
251	Ross	 Oh.
252	Rachel	 Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
253	Ross	 Not yet.
254	Rachel	 So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
255	Gate Agent	 (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
256	Ross	 Pretty soon I guess.
257	Rachel	 Yeah. I’m sorry.
258	Ross	 I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?
259	Rachel	 No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.
260	Ross	 Same difference.
261	Gate Agent	 (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
262	Ross	 I get it! Well, that’s that.
263	Rachel	 No, you know what, I think you should go.
264	Ross	 What?
265	Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.
266	Ross	 Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…
267	Rachel	 Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
268	Ross	 I could, yeah, I can do that.
269	Rachel	 Yeah.
270	Ross	 I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!
271	Rachel	 Good!
272	Ross	 I know, why not?
273	Rachel	 Right!
274	Ross	 Right?
275	Rachel	 Right!
276	Ross	 Y’know—thanks! (They hug)
277	Rachel	 Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
278	Ross	 Yeah, well…nah.
279	Rachel	 What? Wait, what?
280	Ross	 Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
281	Rachel	 Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?
282	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
283	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
284	Ross	 No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
285	Rachel	 Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
286	Ross	 Okay!
287	Rachel	 Okay!
288	Ross	 Cool!
289	Rachel	 All right!

291	Rachel	 Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.
292	Ross	 Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
293	Rachel	 Oh, wait-wait-wait…
294	Ross	 You tell them to wait!
295	Rachel	 Okay. Wait! Wait!
296		(Ross retrieves his jacket and sees that not only has Emily arrived, but she as seen Rachel take her place on the plane.)
297	Ross	 Emily.
298		(She stares at him and Ross realizes what she’s thinking.)
299	Ross	 Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No! Emily!
