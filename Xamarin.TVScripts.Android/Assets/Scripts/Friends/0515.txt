2	[Scene	 The hallway, Ross is running up the stairs. Note
3	Ross	 Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
4	Chandler	 (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
5	Monica	 What are you doing?!
6	Chandler	 Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
7	Monica	 Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
8		(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)
9	Ross	 What the hell are doing?!!
10	Rachel	 (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!
11	Chandler	 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
12	Joey	 (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
13	Ross	 (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
14	Chandler	 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
15	Monica	 I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
16		(There's a brief pause.)
17	Ross	 (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
18	Rachel	 Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
19		(There's another pause as Ross gets angry again.)
20	Ross	 What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
21	Rachel	 Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
22		(Pause.)
23	Ross	 (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)
24	Joey	 Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.) Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there.]
27	Ross	 Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…
28	Chandler	 (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
29	Joey	 (quickly) I call Godfather!
30	Ross	 You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
31	Joey	 Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
32	Monica	 Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
33	Chandler	 Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
34	Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
35	Phoebe	 Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
36	Rachel	 Okay.
37		(A girl enters.)
38	Joey	 (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
39	Katie	 Hi!
40	All	 Hi!
41	Joey	 So, are you ready to go?
42	Katie	 Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
43	Joey	 Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)
44	Katie	 Hey, where are we going to lunch?
45	Joey	 I was thinking Chinese food.
46	Katie	 Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! (She hits him repeatedly as she says that.)
47		(She heads to the bathroom and Joey sits back down.)
48	Rachel	 She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
49	Joey	 I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…
50	Monica	 But what?
51	Joey	 (shyly) She keeps punching me.
52		(They all laugh.)
53	Monica	 In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
54	Joey	 Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.
55	Monica	 I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
56	Chandler	 Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
57	Rachel	 Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
58	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, he's unpacking after moving in. There's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
59	Ross	 (opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!
60	Phoebe	 Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
61	Ross	 Aww.
62	Phoebe	 Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
63	Ross	 Huh.
64	Phoebe	 Bread, so you never go hungry.
65	Ross	 Ohh.
66	Phoebe	 And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
67	Ross	 Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
68	Phoebe	 Yeah!
69		(The door across the hall opens and a guy walks into Ross's apartment.)
70	Guy	 Hi!
71	Ross	 Hi!
72	Guy	 Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
73	Ross	 Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
74	Steve	 Oh hi Phoebe.
75	Phoebe	 Mr. President.
76	Steve	 I came to talk to you about Howard.
77	Ross	 Howard?
78	Steve	 Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
79	Ross	 Oh that's nice.
80	Steve	 Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or…
81	Ross	 Oh. Uhh…
82	Steve	 Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)
83	Ross	 No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.
84	Steve	 Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
85	Ross	 Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
86	Steve	 Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)
87	Ross	 No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
88	Steve	 Howard's the handy man!
89	Ross	 Yes but too me he's just, man.
90	Steve	 Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)
91	Ross	 (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
92	Phoebe	 Yeah. I really like his glasses.
93	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross is lamenting to Chandler and Rachel about his troubles in his new building.]
94	Ross	 …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
95	Chandler	 (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
96	Rachel	 Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
97	Ross	 It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
98	Rachel	 Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
99	Ross	 Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
100	Rachel	 And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
101	Chandler	 Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
102	Rachel	 Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
103	Chandler	 Wh-wh-why?!
104	Rachel	 Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
105	Chandler	 Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
106	Rachel	 Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
107	Chandler	 I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
108	Rachel	 No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
109	Chandler	 Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
110	Rachel	 Not unless different means the same.
111	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is sitting on the couch with Katie.]
112	Katie	 You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)
113	Joey	 (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
114	Katie	 No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and he retreats to the arm of the couch.)
115	Joey	 Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
116	Katie	 Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the couch.)
117	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Monica are curled up on one of the chairs.]
118	Monica	 Isn't this great?
119	Chandler	 Hmm.
120	Monica	 Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
121	Chandler	 Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
122	Monica	 Are you okay?
123	Chandler	 Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
124	Monica	 What-what are you doing?
125	Chandler	 I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
126	Monica	 Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
127	Chandler	 What?!
128	Monica	 Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
129	Chandler	 Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
130	Monica	 Oh and you know what I want!
131	Chandler	 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
132	Monica	 I do not have baby fever!
133	Chandler	 Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
134	Monica	 Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
135	Chandler	 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
136	Monica	 You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
137	Chandler	 Well, I did not know that.
138		Commercial Break
139	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is getting advice from Ross and Joey.]
140	Chandler	 It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
141	Ross and Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
142	Chandler	 By me?
143	Ross	 Oh, no!
144	Joey	 No-no.
145	Ross	 Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
146	Joey	 Yeah, big!
147		(Monica enters.)
148	Joey	 Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
149	Monica	 Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
150	Chandler	 Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
151	Monica	 I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
152	Chandler	 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
153	Monica	 What?!
154	Chandler	 Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
155	Monica	 Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
156		(Chandler turns to watch her go and then sees Ross and Joey both with huge grimaces on their faces.)
157	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, he's having his party, only he's the only guest. He gets up and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it. So he takes it off and puts on one that says Dr. Geller and he puts the Ross one underneath the Dr. Geller one. Then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for Howard raging in the apartment across the hall.]
158	Party Guests	 (chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (Ross goes to investigate the noise) Howard! Howard! Howard! (They're holding Howard above their heads.) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (He sees Phoebe chanting along with them.) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
159	Ross	 Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
160	Phoebe	 Oh, hi Ross!
161	Ross	 What are you doing?
162	Phoebe	 Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)
163	Guest #1	 See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
164	Ross	 You chipped in?!
165	Phoebe	 Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
166	Ross	 Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
167	Phoebe	 Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
168	Ross	 Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
169	Phoebe	 No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
170	Steve	 (walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!
171	Phoebe	 Hey!
172	Steve	 Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks away.)
173		(Ross turns and glares at Phoebe.)
174	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, my bad.
175	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is getting some coffee as Joey enters. He's looking a little puffy, but that's probably from the large number of different color sweaters he's wearing.]
176	Joey	 Hey!
177	Rachel	 Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.
178	Joey	 Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
179	Rachel	 Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
180	Joey	 Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
181	Katie	 (entering) Hi!
182	Joey	 Hey! Hiya!
183	Rachel	 Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
184	Katie	 Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)
185	Rachel	 Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
186	Katie	 Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too much! (Punches Rachel.)
187	Rachel	 Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
188	Katie	 Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)
189	Rachel	 Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
190	Katie	 You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)
191	Rachel	 Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
192	Katie	 Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
193	Joey	 Huh.
194	Katie	 Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
195	Joey	 Uhh….
196	Katie	 You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
197	Joey	 Nah.
198		(She looks at Rachel and storms out. After she's left Joey hugs Rachel in thanks.)
199	[Scene	 Howard's party, Phoebe is talking Ross up to two more partygoers. Ross isn't happy about it.]
200	Ross	 (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
201	Phoebe	 (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying. (Laughs.)
202	Ross	 (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
203	Phoebe	 Ooh. (Turns to him.)
204	Ross	 Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
205	Phoebe	 No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
206		(They go to the food table.)
207	Ross	 So uh, what did you tell them about me?
208	Phoebe	 Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
209	Ross	 Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
210	Phoebe	 But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
211	Ross	 What?!
212	Phoebe	 Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
213	Ross	 (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
214	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
215	Guest #2	 (sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?
216		(Steve goes over to look at Ross who's trying to look cool, but has some frosting on his lip.)
217	Steve	 3-B!
218	All	 Oh yeah, aww!
219	Steve	 Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
220	Guest #3	 Yeah, leave!
221	All	 Yeah, get out! Now!
222	Steve	 Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
223	Phoebe	 All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
224	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross and Phoebe have been banished to Ross's place.]
225	Phoebe	 Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
226	Ross	 Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
227	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler comes running in. Everyone else is already there.]
228	Chandler	 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
229	Monica	 (raising her hand) I'm Monica.
230	Chandler	 I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
231	Monica	 Okay.
232	Chandler	 Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
233	Monica	 Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
234	Chandler	 (getting out a ring box) Monica…
235	Monica	 No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
236	Chandler	 Will you marry me?
237		(Phoebe hides her eyes in shame. Rachel is starring at them wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Joey and Ross are stunned to temporary silence.)
238	Ross	 Oh-no. No. No.
239	Joey	 What a bad idea!
240	Rachel	 Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)
241	Monica	 Chandler, why are you doing this?
242	Chandler	 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
243	Monica	 Chandler.
244	Chandler	 I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
245	Monica	 Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
246	Chandler	 No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?
247	Monica	 (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
248	Chandler	 Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
249	Monica	 Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
250	Chandler	 Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
251	Monica	 Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
252	Ross	 Hey!
253	Joey	 She's right y'know.
254	Ross	 Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
255	Monica	 Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
256	Chandler	 I didn't think I was!
257		(They hug.)
258	Monica	 Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
259	Chandler	 Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
260		Ending Credits
261	[Scene	 Central Perk, Everyone is there.]
262	Joey	 Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
263	Ross	 No, I will not!
264	Joey	 Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
265	Ross	 You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
266		(They all laugh.)
267	Phoebe	 Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
268	Rachel	 Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
269	Chandler	 Okay, how long is this going to go on.
270	Monica	 Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
271	Ross	 This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
272	Chandler	 That's not funny.
273	Joey	 That's not funny at all!
274		(They all get up and leave.)
