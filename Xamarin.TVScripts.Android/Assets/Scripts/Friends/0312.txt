2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her first day.]
3	Rachel	 (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
4	Chandler	 Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
5	Rachel	 (to Ross) Tell him.
6	Ross	 (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
7	Chandler	 All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
8	Ross	 Why?
9	Chandler	 I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
10	Ross	 Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
11	Chandler	 Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
12	Ross	 Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)
13	Phoebe	 (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
14	Chandler	 (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
15	Rachel	 (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
16	Phoebe	 Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
17	Rachel	 No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
18	Ross	 Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
19	Rachel	 Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
20	Ross	 Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
21	Rachel	 Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?
22	Phoebe	 Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
23	Rachel	 Oh.
24	Chandler	 (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
25	Ross	 What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
26	Chandler	 Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
27	Phoebe	 A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clichï¿½. Why don't you get a magician?!
28	Chandler	 Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.

32	Chandler	 Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.
33	Joey	 (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
34	Chandler	 I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
35	Joey	 It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
36	Ross	 Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
37	Joey	 What?
38	Ross	 Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
39	Joey	 Who?

61	Rachel	 Oh, he's just goofing around.
62	Ross	 Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
63	Rachel	 Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
64	Ross	 Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
65	Rachel	 Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
66	Ross	 What?
67	Rachel	 I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. (to Mark) Mark, I need you!
68	Ross	 Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)
69	Rachel	 Ow! Ross!!

72	Jeannine	 (to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
73	Monica	 Please, I'm not going for anything.

75	Monica	 Would you please go?
76	Jeannine	 Night Mon. Night Julio.
77	Julio	 (to Jeannine) Adios.

79	Monica	 Look Julio, someone left their book here.
80	Julio	 Ah actually, that is mine.
81	Monica	 Oh yeah, what are you reading?
82	Julio	 Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
83	Monica	 Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?
84	Julio	 I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
85	Monica	 Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.')
86	Julio	 Actually I ah, I am a poet.
87	Monica	 Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?
88	Julio	 Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip. (points to her lip)
89	Monica	 Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?
90	Julio	 I can write an epic poem about this lip. (grabs her lower lip)
91	Monica	 How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
92	[Scene	 Joey's audition.]
93	Joey	 (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........

96	Director	 Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
97	Joey	 Excellent, I'll be there.
98	Director	 Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
99	Joey	 Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
100	Director	 Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
101	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is reading Joey's resume.]
102	Chandler	 ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
103	Joey	 Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
104	Phoebe	 Well, can you dance at all?
105	Joey	 Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)
106	Chandler	 Oh no, no, no, no.
107	Phoebe	 (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?
108	Joey	 Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
109		(phone rings)
110	Chandler	 All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
111	Monica	 (entering) Hi!
112	Phoebe	 Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
113	Monica	 It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
114	Joey	 Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
115	Chandler	 Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
116	Joey	 Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
117	Monica	 Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)
118	Joey	 (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
119	Chandler	 To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
120	Monica	 Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
121	Phoebe	 Oh yeah.
122	Monica	 Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)
123	Joey	 Whoa, I'm not done.
124	Monica	 All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
125	Chandler	 Bye-bye.
126		(Monica leaves)
127	Phoebe	 Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
128	Chandler	 What, what, what?!
129	Phoebe	 What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
130	Chandler	 You really think that is what he meant?
131	Phoebe	 Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
132	Joey	 Done.
133	[Scene	 Rachel's office, her desk is covered with stuff Ross has sent her.]
134	Mark	 (reaching through the flowers) Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
135	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from Love Story)
136	Mark	 Wh-what's that?
137	Ross	 It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
138	Mark	 Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
139	Rachel	 Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
140	Man	 (to Rachel) Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
141	Rachel	 Yes.
142	Man	 (being joined by the rest of the barbershop quartet) One, two, three...
143	Quartet	 (singing) Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
144	The Bass Barber	 Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
145	Quartet	 (singing) And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
146	The Bass Barber	 It's nice to have a boyfriend.
147	Quartet	 Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
148		Commercial Break
149	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering the living room from her bedroom.]
150	Ross	 I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
151	Rachel	 All right Ross!! I get it!!
152	Ross	 I mean my God...
153	Rachel	 You're hurt!
154	Ross	 ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
155	Rachel	 Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
156	Ross	 I would never do that!
157	Rachel	 Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
158	Ross	 Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
159	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey are there.]
160	Joey	 Mark's a genius!
161	Ross	 Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
162	Chandler	 Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
163	Ross	 What am I going to do?
164	Chandler	 Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
165	Ross	 I don't know you guys.
166	Chandler	 All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
167	Joey	 And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
168	Chandler	 He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
169	[Scene	 Rachel's office.]
170	Woman	 (walking up to Mark) Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
171	Mark	 (turning around) And wait, I've got something for you. (kisses her)
172	Woman	 Mark!!
173	Mark	 It's okay, Rachel knows.
174	Woman	 Yeah, but even soo.
175		(Ross appears in the hallway just outside of Rachel's office.)
176	Mark	 I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
177	Rachel	 Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)
178		(Ross is eavesdropping in the hallway.)
179	Mark	 Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
180		(They start to kiss, and Ross rushes into the office to break it up.)
181	Ross	 All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
182	Mark	 What is going on?
183	Ross	 What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!!
184	Rachel	 (now standing behind Ross) Ross!
185		(Ross finally looks at the woman kissing Mark.)
186	Ross	 I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)
187	[Scene	 Joey's dance audition, Joey is warming up.]
188	Director	 Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
189	Joey	 So, does that mean the audition is off?
190	Director	 Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
191	Joey	 What?!
192	Director	 Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
193	Joey	 It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
194	Director	 Have fun.
195	Joey	 Bye. (does the jazz hands)
196	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is tying a ribbon to a vase.]
197	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
198	Monica	 Hey.
199	Phoebe	 What are you wrapping?
200	Monica	 Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
201	Phoebe	 Yeah, it's a vase.
202	Monica	 Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
203	Phoebe	 Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
204	Monica	 What do you mean?
205	Phoebe	 Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
206	[Scene	 The Moondance Diner.]
207	Monica	 (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
208	Julio	 What?
209	Monica	 Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
210	Julio	 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
211	Monica	 You don't even know me...
212	Julio	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
213	Monica	 What?
214	Julio	 The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
215	Monica	 I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
216	Julio	 No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
217	Monica	 (sarcastically) Oh yeah.
218	[Scene	 Joey's audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.]
219	Director	 All right, let's do it!
220		(The group does the same horrible dance that Joey did earlier in the show, except they're all out of sync and they do the jazz hands at the end.)
221	Director	 No, no, no. What was that?
222	Joey	 I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
223	Director	 Well, people!
224	Joey	 People, people, people.
225	Director	 Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. (to Joey) Show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) Count it off.
226		(The pianist starts to play, and Joey readies himself, and then runs out of the audition.)
227	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are there.]
228	Rachel	 So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
229	Chandler	 Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?
230	Rachel	 Right.
231	Chandler	 And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)
232	Ross	 (entering) Hi.
233	Rachel	 Hello.
234	Chandler	 Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
235	Ross	 (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
236	Rachel	 A big idiot.
237	Ross	 A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
238		(Gunther is eavesdropping in the background.)
239	Rachel	 Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
240	Ross	 Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
241	Gunther	 Let it be me! Let it be me!
242	Rachel	 Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)
243	Ross	 I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
244	Chandler	 Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
245	Rachel	 Where ya going?
246	Ross	 Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
247	Rachel	 Ohh, with who?
248	Ross	 Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
249	Rachel	 There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!
250	Ross	 Yeah.
251	Rachel	 You have a play date with a stripper?!
252	Chandler	 Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
253	Ross	 Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
254	Rachel	 Sure, is she married?
255	Ross	 Ahh, no.
256	Rachel	 Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)
257	Ross	 Are you jealous?
258	Rachel	 Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
259	Ross	 You are totally jealous.
260	Rachel	 I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
261	Ross	 Honey, I love you too.
262	Rachel	 Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
263	Ross	 What?
264		(She runs over and gives him a very passionate kiss.)
265	Ross	 Huh.
266	Rachel	 (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
267	Chandler	 Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.

269	[Scene	 The Moondance Diner.]
270	Man	 (entering) Is there a Julio here?
271	Julio	 (to him) I am Julio.

273	Man	 (singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
274	Quartet	 Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
