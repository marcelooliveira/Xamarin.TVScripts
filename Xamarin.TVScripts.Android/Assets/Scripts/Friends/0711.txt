2	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica’s, Chandler is sitting at the kitchen table eating cheesecake. The box it came in is also on the table.]
3	Chandler	 Ohh. Mmm.
4	Rachel	 (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
5	Chandler	 Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
6	Rachel	 Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)
7	Chandler	 (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
8	Rachel	 Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
9	Chandler	 I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
10	Rachel	 Why, why not?
11	Chandler	 Because it's too delicious.
12	Rachel	 Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
13	Chandler	 No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) Momma’s Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
14	Rachel	 (taking a bite) Oh, I’m sorry, what?
15		Opening Credits
16	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone except Rachel is there as Joey gets up and starts putting on his coat.]
17	Joey	 All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.
18	Chandler	 So…
19	Joey	 Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
20	Phoebe	 Absolutely!
21	Joey	 I’ll see you at 8
22	Phoebe	 Okay. (Joey exits.)
23	Chandler	 Oh, what’s at 8
24	Phoebe	 Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
25	Ross	 Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
26	Phoebe	 Duly noted.
27	Ross	 Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
28	Monica	 What are you talking about?
29	Ross	 Cousin Frannie’s wedding, it's tomorrow night.
30	Monica	 You were invited?!
31	Ross	 No.
32	Monica	 My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
33	Chandler	 Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.
34	Ross	 Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
35	Monica	 Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go to.
36	Ross	 Y’know, she tried to undress me too.
37	Chandler	 I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then shushes him.)
38	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, and Ross are playing Monopoly as Phoebe enters angrily.]
39	Phoebe	 Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
40	Rachel	 Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?
41	Phoebe	 Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)
42	Rachel	 (reading the note) "Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?
43	Phoebe	 Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.
44	Ross	 Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in disgust.)
45	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
46	Phoebe	 Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!
47	Joey	 Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
48	Phoebe	 So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!
49	Joey	 Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
50	Ross	 Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.
51	Phoebe	 I don’t accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their friendship) is for life!
52	Joey	 Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
53	Phoebe	 Well, it does.
54	Joey	 Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
55	Phoebe	 Okay, you wore me down.
56	Ross	 Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
57	Joey	 The Ross—Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)
58	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Rachel enters to find Chandler staring at another cheesecake box.]
59	Rachel	 Hi!
60	Chandler	 Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
61	Rachel	 So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?
62	Chandler	 I can’t seem to say goodbye.
63	Rachel	 Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
64	Chandler	 Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
65	Rachel	 It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
66	Chandler	 (closing the box) Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
67	Rachel	 Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.
68	Chandler	 Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
69	Rachel	 Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the cheesecake.)
70	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica and Joey are there. Joey is reading a newspaper.]
71	Joey	 Awww! Mel Torme died.
72	Monica	 Joey, that paper’s like a year old!
73	Joey	 Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!
74	Ross	 (entering) Hey.
75	Joey	 Hey.
76	Monica	 Hey.
77	Ross	 So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.
78	Monica	 Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
79	Ross	 Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
80	Monica	 (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!
81	Ross	 Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.
82	Monica	 Joan?
83	Ross	 Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
84	Monica	 Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got "and guest?!"
85	Joey	 Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…
86	Ross	 (interrupting) Not broad backed!
87	Monica	 Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!
88	Ross	 What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
89	Monica	 Why not?!
90	Ross	 Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
91	Monica	 Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.
92	Ross	 Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. (Does so.)
93	Joey	 Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
94	Monica	 (laughs) We’ll see.
95	[Scene	 The Lobby of Chandler and Rachel’s building, Chandler and Rachel are returning from lunch.]
96	Chandler	 Well, thank you for lunch.
97	Rachel	 What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!
98	Chandler	 So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
99	Rachel	 (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)
100	Chandler	 Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
101	Rachel	 She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
102	Chandler	 By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
103	Rachel	 No that could kill her.
104	Chandler	 Well, we don’t want that.
105	Rachel	 No, so we’re protecting her.
106	Chandler	 But we should take it.
107	Rachel	 But we should move quick.
108	Chandler	 Why?
109	Rachel	 Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
110	Chandler	 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
111	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are entering. As Phoebe is sitting down, she recognizes someone sitting at the counter.]
112	Phoebe	 (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That’s David!
113	Monica	 David who?
114	Phoebe	 David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
115	David	 (noticing Phoebe) Oh my God!
116	Phoebe	 Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.
117	David	 Phoebe?
118	Phoebe	 David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?
119	David	 Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
120	Phoebe	 Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
121	David	 Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
122	Phoebe	 Yeah.
123	David	 Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…
124	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
125	David	 Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.
126	Phoebe	 Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.
127	David	 Really? Because I think about you all the time.
128	Phoebe	 Really?
129	David	 I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…
130	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
131	David	 That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles…
132	Phoebe	 Yeah.
133	David	 Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?
134	Phoebe	 (excited) Yes! Oh no!
135	David	 (disappointed) Oh. Uh, what?
136	Phoebe	 I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
137	David	 Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…
138	Monica	 Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
139	Phoebe	 Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)
140	Monica	 What are you doing?
141	Phoebe	 Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
142	Monica	 So! He’ll understand!
143	Phoebe	 No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!
144	Monica	 God, you are so strong.
145	Phoebe	 Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9
146		Commercial Break
147	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Chandler are eating the cheesecake right out of the box.]
148	Rachel	 (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
149	Chandler	 I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.
150	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
151	Rachel	 Hey!
152	Joey	 (seeing what they’re doing) What do you got there?
153	Rachel	 Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)
154	Chandler	 What are you doing tonight?
155	Joey	 Huh? Uh… (He starts taking off his pants.)
156	Chandler	 Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
157	Joey	 Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?
158	Chandler	 Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9
159	Joey	 What?! Tonight?!
160	Chandler	 That’s what Monica said.
161	Joey	 After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
162	[Scene	 Cousin Frannie’s Wedding Reception, Monica and Ross are entering and finding their table.]
163	Ross	 Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.
164	Monica	 Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. (To the couple sitting to her right.) Hi!
165	The Wedding Guest	 Hi!
166	Monica	 I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
167	The Wedding Guest	 Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
168	Monica	 Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
169	Ross	 (To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
170	Monica	 (to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
171	The Second Guest	 We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
172	Monica	 Okay, you’re fine.
173	[Scene	 Iridium Restaurant, Phoebe and Joey are looking at the menus as the waiter comes to take their order.]
174	The Waiter	 Hey!
175	Phoebe	 Hey!
176	The Waiter	 Are you guys ready?
177	Phoebe	 Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.
178	The Waiter	 Okay.
179	Phoebe	 Okay.
180	The Waiter	 (To Joey) And for you sir?
181	Joey	 Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?
182	The Waiter	 It’s uh, it’s already been roasted.
183	Joey	 Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
184	Phoebe	 Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)
185	The Waiter	 Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli. (Putting Joey’s menu under his arm.)
186	Joey	 Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) Y’know what Pheebs?
187	Phoebe	 Huh?
188	Joey	 You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
189	Phoebe	 (checking her watch) Yeah, I’m very wise. I know.
190	Joey	 Y’know-y’know what I really want?
191	Phoebe	 What?
192	Joey	 Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
193	The Waiter	 (returning) Any progress?
194	Joey	 Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
195	Phoebe	 God Joey, this is taking forever!
196	Joey	 What’s the rush? What?
197	Phoebe	 W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.
198	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, what is it?
199	Phoebe	 Well… It’s a date.
200	Joey	 A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
201	Phoebe	 Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.
202	Joey	 No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!
203	Phoebe	 That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.
204	Joey	 Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
205	Phoebe	 She was?
206	Joey	 Well, she graduated from high school!
207	Phoebe	 Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him! (Gets up and leaves.)
208	Joey	 Fine!
209	Phoebe	 Yeah!
210	Joey	 Fine!
211	Phoebe	 Yeah! (She exits.)
212	Joey	 (to the waiter) What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
213	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is running up to meet David.]
214	Phoebe	 Hey!
215	David	 Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.
216	Phoebe	 Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.
217	David	 Well, I’m very glad you’re here. (Kisses her hand.)
218	Phoebe	 Oh, you’re such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We’re going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)
219	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating the cheesecake and Chandler enters and catches her in the act.]
220	Chandler	 Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
221	Rachel	 (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
222	Chandler	 I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
223	Rachel	 Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are dessert stealers! We are living outside the law!
224	Chandler	 Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
225	Rachel	 What?! What?!
226	Chandler	 Oh yes!
227	Rachel	 Wait a minute!
228	Chandler	 Oh yes!
229	Rachel	 Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!
230		[Cut to Chandler and Monica’s as they enter.]
231	Chandler	 Oh yes! Oh yes!
232	Rachel	 You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
233	Chandler	 Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!
234	Rachel	 What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
235	Chandler	 What do we use to split it?
236	Rachel	 Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.
237	Chandler	 (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…
238	Rachel	 Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
239	Chandler	 All right, I’ll pick that one. (Points.)
240	Rachel	 That’s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast. (As she’s saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!
241	Chandler	 (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
242	Rachel	 Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
243	Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my… (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)
244	[Scene	 Cousin Frannie’s Wedding Reception, Monica and Ross are sitting at the table, alone, as a woman approaches.]
245	The Woman	 Ross, sweetheart!
246	Ross	 Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
247	Aunt Millie	 Isn’t it a beautiful wedding?!
248	Ross	 Yes, yes it is. It’s uh… (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
249		(Cousin Frannie and her husband enter.)
250	Monica	 Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me? (Starts to get up and greet Frannie.)
251	Ross	 Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.
252	Monica	 Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
253	Ross	 That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannie’s shoulder.)
254	Frannie	 (turning around) Monica! What…
255	Monica	 Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
256	Ross	 (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
257	Monica	 You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! (Frannie’s husband walks up.) Stuart!
258	Frannie	 I believe you know my husband.
259		(Monica is shocked into silence.)
260	Ross	 So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.
261	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, David has a cab waiting to take him to the airport and he’s saying goodbye to Phoebe.]
262	David	 Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can’t miss my flight.
263	Phoebe	 Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…
264	David	 July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.)
265	Phoebe	 That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
266	David	 Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.
267	Phoebe	 That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
268	David	 Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.
269	Phoebe	 You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.
270	David	 I-I do though.
271	Phoebe	 I do too. (They kiss.)
272	David	 Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and witnesses that event.)
273	Phoebe	 (seeing him) Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
274	Joey	 No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?
275	Phoebe	 No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. (Crying.)
276	Joey	 Hey, y’know you could always visit him.
277	Phoebe	 Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.
278	Joey	 Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
279	Phoebe	 Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)
280	Joey	 I can give it a shot.
281	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler and Rachel are on their knees with forks trying to salvage what they can of the cheesecake off of the floor.]
282	Rachel	 Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
283	Chandler	 Stick to your side!
284	Rachel	 Hey, come on now!
285		(Joey finishes climbing the stairs and sees them. Chandler and Rachel both stop and look up at him. Joey sits down on the step.)
286	Joey	 (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging in.)
287		Ending Credits
288	[Scene	 Cousin Frannie’s Wedding Reception, Ross and Monica are at the door and about to leave.]
289	Monica	 Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
290	Ross	 What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)
291	Aunt Millie	 Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
292	Ross	 Well…
293	Aunt Millie	 Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
294		(Ross hesitates then leans down trying to get her to kiss his cheek, but she moves his head around and kisses him on the lips again.)
295	Ross	 Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica’s wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
