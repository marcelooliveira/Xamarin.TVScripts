2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is looking around the shop as Phoebe returns from getting some more coffee.]
3	Rachel	 Phoebe?
4	Phoebe	 Yeah?
5	Rachel	 Look at that guy by the window, wow!
6	Phoebe	 He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.
7	Rachel	 Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
8	Phoebe	 Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
9	Rachel	 Yeah.
10	Phoebe	 This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
11	Rachel	 Really?! So this has happened to you?
12	Phoebe	 Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
13	Rachel	 Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.
14	Phoebe	 Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
15	Rachel	 Ah.
16	Phoebe	 Yeah.
17	Rachel	 Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
18	Phoebe	 Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.
19		Opening Credits
20	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Mona enters.]
21	Mona	 Hey! (To Joey) Hey!
22	Ross	 Hi!
23	Mona	 Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
24	Ross	 Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
25	Joey	 Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. (Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn’t move from his chair.)
26	Ross	 Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
27	Mona	 Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
28	Joey	 I’m missin’ picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at him and he retreats.)
29	Phoebe	 (sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!
30	Mona	 Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us.
31	Ross	 Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
32	Mona	 Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
33	Ross	 (pause) Together? Like-like to people?
34	Mona	 Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute, okay?
35	Ross	 Okay. (Not happy about it.)
36	Mona	 Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
37	Ross	 Uh sure, sure.
38	Mona	 Bye guys.
39	Phoebe	 Bye.
40		(Mona exits.)
41	Joey	 (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
42	Ross	 I know. Can you believe that?
43	Phoebe	 Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?
44	Ross	 Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
45	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!
46	[Scene	 Chandler’s Office, his boss Doug is entering, Monica is there as well.]
47	Doug	 Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
48	Chandler	 Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
49	Monica	 Yes, hi.
50	Doug	 Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
51	Chandler	 I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.
52	Doug	 Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
53	Monica	 No leg-chewing for us sir.
54	Doug	 Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
55	Monica	 I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?
56	Doug	 Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
57	Monica	 Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
58	Chandler	 No.
59	Monica	 That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
60	Chandler	 Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?
61	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, there’s a knock on the door and he opens it to Mona.]
62	Mona	 Hi!
63	Ross	 Hey!
64	Mona	 Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
65	Ross	 Huh. Wow, this is great.
66	Mona	 Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
67	Ross	 Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
68	Mona	 How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred.
69	Ross	 A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
70	Mona	 Really? Why not?
71	Ross	 Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
72	Mona	 Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right. You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?
73	Ross	 Yeah.
74	Mona	 Where are we?
75	Ross	 Huh.
76	Mona	 Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
77	Ross	 Hmm…
78	Mona	 I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hope we’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t you think?
79		(Pause.)
80	Ross	 Let’s do the card!
81	Mona	 What?
82	Ross	 The card! I think we’re there!
83	Mona	 Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.
84	Ross	 Really?! I mean, even with the card?
85	[Scene	 Rachel’s Doctor’s Office, she is waiting for her doctor as a nurse enters.]
86	Nurse	 Hi!
87	Rachel	 Hi!
88	Nurse	 Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
89	Rachel	 Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)
90	Dr. Schiff	 (entering) Hi Rachel? I’m Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he’s an attractive man.)
91	Rachel	 Yes, you are.
92	Dr. Schiff	 So, how’s it going?
93	Rachel	 Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
94	Dr. Schiff	 I’m a doctor.
95	Rachel	 Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
96	Dr. Schiff	 Uh, I don’t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
97	Rachel	 Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
98	Dr. Schiff	 So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
99	Rachel	 No. I’m very comfortable.
100	Dr. Schiff	 Any painful gas?
101	Rachel	 No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
102	Dr. Schiff	 Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
103	Rachel	 Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
104	Dr. Schiff	 I’m sorry, is there something going on here?
105	Rachel	 Do you feel it too?
106	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are there as Rachel enters.]
107	Rachel	 Hi.
108	Phoebe	 Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?
109	Rachel	 Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
110	Phoebe	 Oh my God.
111	Monica	 Why did you do that?
112	Phoebe	 Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
113	Monica	 Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
114	Phoebe	 You wish.
115	Monica	 Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.
116	Phoebe	 Oh yeah? Come and get it.
117	Rachel	 Okay, even this is turning me on!
118	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
119	Rachel	 Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
120	Ross	 Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
121	Monica	 You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
122	Ross	 Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
123	Phoebe	 Ugh! Women!
124	Ross	 I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
125	Rachel	 Uh Ross? You asked me that.
126	Ross	 Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
127	Monica	 Like asking her to move in with you?
128	Ross	 Smaller than that.
129	Monica	 Making her a mixed tape?
130	Ross	 Uh, bigger than that.
131	Phoebe	 Give her a key to your apartment.
132	Ross	 Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
133	Monica	 All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
134	Ross	 Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
135	Phoebe	 No, we hate that.
136	Monica	 That is a slap in the face.
137	Ross	 Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
138	Rachel	 I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
139	[Scene	 Chandler’s Office, Doug is entering.]
140	Doug	 Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock.
141	Chandler	 Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
142	Doug	 Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
143	Chandler	 Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
144	Doug	 Oh? Why not?
145	Chandler	 It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
146	Doug	 What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
147	Chandler	 Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
148	Doug	 So why can’t the three of us go out together?
149	Chandler	 Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
150	Doug	 Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
151	Chandler	 Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
152	Doug	 Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.
153	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.
154	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is getting Mona some coffee.]
155	Ross	 Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
156	Mona	 Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
157	Ross	 Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there isn’t.)
158	Mona	 Okay.
159	Ross	 I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?
160	Mona	 I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?
161	Ross	 Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.
162	Mona	 Okay…
163	Ross	 But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)
164	Mona	 Really?!
165	Ross	 Really.
166	Mona	 You don’t think this is too fast.
167		(Ross groans no.)
168		Commercial Break
169	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Ross is telling Rachel and Monica about yet another mistake he’s made with a woman.]
170	Rachel	 You gave her a key to your apartment?!
171	Ross	 Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
172	Phoebe	 (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?
173	Ross	 Oh great, I live on the street.
174	Phoebe	 Where?! (Ross exits.)
175	Rachel	 Hey!
176	Phoebe	 Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
177	Roger	 Hey everybody.
178	Monica	 Hi Roger.
179	Phoebe	 So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me out?
180	Rachel	 Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
181	Phoebe	 Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.
182	Rachel	 What?
183	Phoebe	 You’re welcome.
184	Rachel	 Phoebe no!
185	Phoebe	 It’s okay, he’s a virgin.
186	Monica	 Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.
187	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.
188	Rachel	 No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
189	Phoebe	 Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! (Phoebe exits.)
190	[Scene	 A Strip Club, Doug and Chandler are there.]
191	Doug	 Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
192	Chandler	 Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.
193	Doug	 Bing—What’s this?! (Grabs his hand.)
194	Chandler	 It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
195	Doug	 No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
196	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no!
197	Doug	 Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
198	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, a locksmith has finished changing the locks on Ross’s door.]
199	Ross	 Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
200	Mona	 (entering) Hey Ross, what’s going on? You changing the lock?
201	Ross	 No. That guy is.
202	Mona	 I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
203	Locksmith	 Good luck buddy. (Exits.)
204	Mona	 Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you’re-you’re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
205	Ross	 I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
206	Mona	 What?
207	Ross	 I love you!
208	Mona	 Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn’t happy.)
209	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is eating dinner as Chandler enters.]
210	Chandler	 Hi honey I’m home.
211	Monica	 From the tequila factory?
212	Chandler	 It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
213	Monica	 Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
214	Chandler	 Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
215	Monica	 I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
216	Chandler	 Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.
217	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is on the phone.]
218	Rachel	 Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey enters.) I’ll call you back.
219	Joey	 Who was that?
220	Rachel	 It’s just the pizza place.
221	Joey	 You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.
222	Rachel	 I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.
223	Joey	 Oh, what’s wrong?
224	Rachel	 Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.
225	Joey	 Then why did I ask?
226	Rachel	 Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
227	Joey	 Is that college talk for horny?
228	Rachel	 Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?
229	Joey	 Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
230	Rachel	 Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.
231	Joey	 Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
232	Rachel	 Okay, good night!
233	Joey	 Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
234		(Pause.)
235	Joey	 (entering) I can’t do it!
236	Rachel	 (entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!
237	Joey	 You’re Rachel!
238	Rachel	 You’re Joey!
239	Joey	 You’re my friend!
240	Rachel	 Right back at ya!
241	Joey	 But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
242	Rachel	 And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!
243	Joey	 I know!
244		(Pause.)
245	Joey	 Do you wanna do it?
246	Rachel	 No!
247	Joey	 All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
248	Rachel	 That’s the end of this conversation!
249	Joey	 This conversation never happened!
250	Rachel	 Never happened! Good night!
251	Joey	 Good night!
252		(They both go into their rooms and after a little while Rachel pokes her head into the living room.)
253	Joey	 Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
254		Closing Credits
255	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Phoebe enters.]
256	Phoebe	 Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonna want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause) (Entering) I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout and exits for good.)
