2	[Scene	 Central Perk, it’s the same scene from the end of last week’s show. Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch as Ross enters.]
3	Ross	 Hey!
4	Rachel	 Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
5	Ross	 Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.
6	Rachel	 Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
7	Ross	 Oh yeah, why not?
8	Rachel	 Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
9	Ross	 Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
10	Phoebe	 Always.
11	Ross	 I didn’t get the annulment.
12	Phoebe	 What?!
13	Ross	 We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
14		[Cut to outside Central Perk.]
15	Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?
16	Rachel	 Oh? Yeah! Sure!
17	Phoebe	 (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
18	Rachel	 Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.
19		(A cab pulls up.)
20	Phoebe	 Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)
21	Rachel	 Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.
22	Phoebe	 Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!
23	Ross	 I know.
24	Phoebe	 Ross?!
25	Ross	 Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
26	Phoebe	 Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
27	Ross	 Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!
28	Phoebe	 So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.
29	Ross	 Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?
30	Phoebe	 Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
31		(Rachel’s cab backs up.)
32	Rachel	 (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
33	Phoebe	 Hey Rach!
34	Rachel	 What was that?!
35	Phoebe	 Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
36	Rachel	 I haven’t seen it yet!
37	Phoebe	 Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
38	Rachel	 Noooooooo!!
39		Opening Credits
40	{Transciber’s note	 In case you’re wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names. Now, on with the show…}
41	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are cuddling on the couch.]
42	Chandler	 Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
43	Monica	 Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
44	Chandler	 No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.
45	Monica	 Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?
46	Chandler	 No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to the bathroom." He may think I’m sick.
47	Monica	 Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.
48	Chandler	 Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
49	Monica	 Pretty much.
50	Chandler	 All right.
51	Joey	 (entering) Hey Monica!
52	Monica	 Hi!
53	Joey	 (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)
54	Monica	 Joey, we have something to tell you.
55	Joey	 Oh my God! You’re pregnant!
56	Chandler	 No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.
57	Joey	 Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)
58	Monica	 Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
59	Joey	 Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!
60	Chandler	 Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!
61	Joey	 (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)
62	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch as Monica enters.]
63	Monica	 Hey Pheebs!
64	Phoebe	 Hey!
65	Monica	 Hey, have you seen Rachel?
66	Phoebe	 No, why?
67	Monica	 I have some pretty exciting news!
68	Phoebe	 (gasps) You’re pregnant!
69	Monica	 No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
70	Phoebe	 Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint
71		(Ross returns from getting some coffee.)
72	Ross	 Hey! Hi!
73	Monica	 Hey!
74	Ross	 What’s up?
75	Monica	 Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
76	Ross	 Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
77	Phoebe	 Guys, I’m happy too.
78	Monica	 Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
79	Phoebe	 Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winks at Ross.)
80	Monica	 Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? (Exits.)
81	Ross	 Bye.
82	Phoebe	 Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
83	Ross	 Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!
84	Phoebe	 Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…
85	Ross	 (interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
86	Phoebe	 Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
87	Ross	 Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
88	Phoebe	 Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.
89	Ross	 What?! Why?
90		(She grabs his arm and drags him over to a table where three beautiful women are sitting. Now, I’m going to go out on a limb and say that their names are Stephanie, Karin, and Meg. Okay, so I looked at the credits. Of course, only Meg is named later on, so I’ll have to guess who is Stephanie and who is Karin. But, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.)
91	Phoebe	 (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?
92	Ross	 And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
93	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is pacing anxiously waiting for Rachel.]
94	Chandler	 (entering) Hey!
95	Monica	 Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
96	Chandler	 (looking down) What gave me away?
97	Monica	 I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!
98	Chandler	 Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
99	Monica	 No.
100	Chandler	 Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.
101		(They hug as Rachel enters.)
102	Rachel	 Hey!
103	Chandler	 Hey.
104	Rachel	 Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
105	Chandler	 Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
106	Rachel	 I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
107	Chandler	 Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…
108	Rachel	 What?
109	Chandler	 (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
110	Monica	 Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
111	Rachel	 Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!
112	Monica	 Really?!
113	Rachel	 And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
114	Monica	 Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)
115	Rachel	 And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.
116	Chandler	 Rach…
117	Monica	 Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.
118	Rachel	 Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door…
119	Monica	 (singing) We’ll be waiting for you…
120	{Transciber’s note	 I’ll finish that one for those of you who don’t know what they’re talking about. Where the towels are Hers and Hers and His, Three’s Company too! Yeah, that’s the theme song for Three’s Company.}
121		Commercial Break
122	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is hosting an impromptu roundtable discussion with Stephanie, Karin, and Meg about Ross’s three divorces.]
123	Ross	 …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.
124	Phoebe	 Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?
125	Stephanie	 Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married.
126	Phoebe	 Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?
127	Karin	 Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…
128	Phoebe	 (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
129	Meg	 Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
130	Ross	 What?!
131	Phoebe	 (leaning to him) She said, "He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)
132	Ross	 This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
133	Phoebe	 Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
134	Ross	 We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
135	Phoebe	 Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
136	Ross	 (to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.
137	Phoebe	 Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
138	Ross	 (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!
139	Meg	 Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.
140	Karin	 I am so attracted to him right now.
141	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are still debating about how to tell Rachel that Chandler’s moving in and she’s moving out.]
142	Chandler	 Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
143	Monica	 Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!
144	Chandler	 Well, Joey’s my best friend.
145	Monica	 I’m not your best friend?
146	Chandler	 You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
147	Monica	 All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.
148	Chandler	 Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
149	Monica	 (slapping his hand) Hey!
150	Chandler	 Hey-hey!
151	Monica	 These aren’t for you! Are you upset?
152	Chandler	 I am now!
153	Rachel	 (entering) Hey roomie!
154	Chandler	 Okay, bye! (Exits.)
155	Monica	 Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.
156	Rachel	 (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
157	Monica	 No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
158	Rachel	 Um-hmm.
159	Monica	 Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
160	Rachel	 (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.
161	Monica	 Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.
162	Rachel	 Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
163	Monica	 Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?
164	Rachel	 Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
165	Monica	 Maybe, do you need a tissue?
166		(Rachel mumbles uh-huh and spits the half-eaten cookie out onto the tissue.)
167	Rachel	 Monica, where did you get these?!
168	Monica	 I made them!
169	Rachel	 Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
170	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is packing some books and Joey is watching him.]
171	Joey	 God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there."
172	Chandler	 Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
173	Joey	 Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
174	Chandler	 Not once did we do that.
175	Monica	 (entering) Hi.
176	Chandler	 Hey!
177	Joey	 Hi.
178	Monica	 So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
179	Chandler	 Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?
180	Monica	 Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
181	Chandler	 And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?
182	Monica	 I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
183	Joey	 Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!
184	Chandler	 Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
185	[Scene	 Ross’s lawyer’s office, his name is Russell and has just been told by Ross about his current situation.]
186	Russell	 You got married again.
187	Ross	 Yes.
188	Russell	 So that’s your second marriage in two years.
189	Ross	 Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
190	Russell	 Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened.
191	Ross	 Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
192	Russell	 (interrupting) I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
193	Ross	 Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
194	Russell	 Oh, that’s better then.
195	Ross	 This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
196	Russell	 I see. Have you considered therapy?
197	Ross	 I think just the annulment for today.
198	Russell	 There are a couple of forms to fill out.
199	Ross	 Easy.
200	Russell	 And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
201	Ross	 No problem.
202	Russell	 And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
203	Ross	 Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
204	Russell	 Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
205	Ross	 Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
206	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is painting her toe nails as Monica enters.]
207	Rachel	 Hey!
208	Monica	 Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
209	Rachel	 Okay!
210	Monica	 Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
211	Rachel	 Okay.
212	Monica	 Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!
213	Rachel	 (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
214	Monica	 I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
215	Rachel	 Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
216	Monica	 Something to remember me by!
217	Rachel	 Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.
218	Monica	 But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
219	Rachel	 Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
220	Monica	 I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.
221	Rachel	 Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.
222	Monica	 An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!
223	Rachel	 What is the matter with you?!
224	Monica	 What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!
225	Rachel	 All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.
226	Monica	 What’s hard to believe?
227	Rachel	 Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.
228	Monica	 Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
229	Rachel	 But I…
230	Monica	 No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
231	Rachel	 It is? Really?
232	Monica	 Yeah, sweetie.
233	Rachel	 (starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?
234	Monica	 No.
235	Rachel	 What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
236	Monica	 I’m gonna miss you! (They hug.)
237	Rachel	 I mean it’s the end of an era!
238	Monica	 I know!
239	[Scene	 The hallway, Ross is coming up the stairs as Phoebe leaves Joey and Chandler’s.]
240	Phoebe	 (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!
241	Ross	 Oh no.
242	Phoebe	 So? Did you get the annulment?
243	Ross	 I couldn’t.
244	Phoebe	 I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
245	Ross	 It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
246	Phoebe	 Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.
247	Ross	 I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
248	Phoebe	 I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.
249	Ross	 I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
250		[Cut to Monica and Rachel’s as Ross walks through the door. Rachel is holding the chrome star and crying.]
251	Ross	 Ohh, what’s wrong?!
252	Rachel	 Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
253	Ross	 Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.
254	Rachel	 Thank you.
255	Ross	 Of course.
256		(Ross suddenly realizes something.)
257		Ending Credits
258	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are talking.]
259	Joey	 So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
260	Phoebe	 Oh we do, but not just yet.
261	Joey	 Really?! Well, when?
262	Phoebe	 Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.
263	Joey	 Wow.
264	Phoebe	 I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
265	Joey	 Great!
266	Phoebe	 But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.
267	Joey	 Oh-oh, what about Ross?
268	Phoebe	 I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
269		End
