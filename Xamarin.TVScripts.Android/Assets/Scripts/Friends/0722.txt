2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are sitting around the kitchen table as Ross enters.]
3	Ross	 Hey!
4	Monica	 Hey!
5	Ross	 Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.
6	Rachel	 Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.
7	Monica	 Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
8	Ross	 It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
9	Monica	 Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.
10	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
11	Ross	 Hey!
12	Phoebe	 Hey!
13	Joey	 Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
14	Rachel	 (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
15	Phoebe	 I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
16	Monica	 Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, "You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel" plan!
17	Rachel	 Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.
18	Phoebe	 Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
19	Monica	 Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.
20	Ross	 Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
21	Joey	 Yeah, you got a couple hours?
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is there as Ross enters with all his hair sticking straight up.]
24	Ross	 Whew! That was a brisk ride!
25	Rachel	 Take the top down did ya?
26	Ross	 Only way to fly.
27		(Rachel laughs.)
28	Rachel	 Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!
29	Ross	 You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
30	Rachel	 Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
31		(A woman walks by and smiles at Ross’s hair.)
32	Ross	 Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.
33	Rachel	 I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
34	Ross	 What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
35	Rachel	 Gimme the keys!
36	Ross	 No way!
37	Rachel	 Well no brush!
38	Ross	 Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
39		(He goes to the bathroom and after he leaves Rachel goes through his coat and grabs the keys along with a $20 bill. The woman from before watches her do this.)
40	Rachel	 (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
41	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Phoebe are counting the invitations as Chandler exits from the bathroom.]
42	Monica	 Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.
43	Chandler	 Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
44	Monica	 Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.
45	Chandler	 I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not that close. I haven’t seen him in years.
46	Monica	 Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!
47	Chandler	 Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
48	Phoebe	 Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
49	Chandler	 Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
50	Monica	 So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.
51	Phoebe	 Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
52	[Scene	 A Street, Rachel is throwing her coat into the Porsche and getting in.]
53	Rachel	 Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!
54		(Suddenly from out of nowhere Ross dives onto the hood.)
55	Rachel	 My God!
56	Ross	 What do you think you’re doing?!
57	Rachel	 Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)
58	Ross	 There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
59	Rachel	 Oh.
60	{Transcriber’s Note	 She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}
61	Ross	 No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)
62	Rachel	 Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!
63	Ross	 With you?! Yeah right!
64	Rachel	 All right. (She starts off.)
65	Ross	 (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
66	Rachel	 What are you doing?! Get in the front!
67	Ross	 In the death seat?!!
68	Rachel	 Oh my…
69		(They drive off.)
70	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are on the couch as a man enters.]
71	Man	 Hey guys!
72	Joey	 Hey!
73	Phoebe	 Hey sweetie!
74	Man	 Ready to go?
75	Phoebe	 Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. (She goes to get it.)
76	Man	 (stopping her) Wait a minute!
77	Phoebe	 What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
78	Joey	 So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
79	Man	 Over a month.
80	Joey	 Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
81	Man	 Sure, I’d like that.
82	Joey	 So uh, what’s your name?
83	Man	 (laughs) It's Jake.
84	Joey	 Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
85	Jake	 Yeah, big fan.
86	Joey	 Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?
87	Jake	 Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt revealing a pink lace secret.)
88	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is entering from the bedroom carrying two bags of luggage.]
89	Monica	 Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
90	Chandler	 What’s this?
91	Monica	 It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.
92	Chandler	 Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
93	Monica	 We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
94	Chandler	 Y’know we already went over this and I won!
95	Monica	 No you didn’t. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.
96	Chandler	 Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.
97	Monica	 Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…
98	Chandler	 No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
99	Monica	 Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.
100	Chandler	 He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!
101	Monica	 Who’s Mr. Garibaldi?
102	Chandler	 Does it matter?!
103	Monica	 Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
104	Chandler	 Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.
105	Monica	 Yes!
106	Chandler	 So I really never get to win anymore?
107	Monica	 How much did ever really win before?
108	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Joey enters.]
109	Joey	 Pheebs!
110	Phoebe	 Hey!
111	Joey	 Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
112	Phoebe	 Yeah!
113	Joey	 Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!
114	Phoebe	 I know. They were mine.
115	Joey	 Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!
116	Phoebe	 No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
117	Joey	 That’s weird!
118	Phoebe	 I’m wearing his briefs right now.
119	Joey	 That’s…kinda hot.
120	Phoebe	 I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
121	Joey	 Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.
122	Phoebe	 And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
123	Joey	 Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
124	Phoebe	 There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
125	Joey	 Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
126	Phoebe	 I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.
127	Joey	 Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
128	Phoebe	 Okay, whatever.
129	Joey	 You’ve seen my huge stack of porn, right? (Phoebe nods.)
130	[Scene	 The Porsche, Rachel is driving along a highway and Ross has finally moved to the death seat and is terrified.]
131	Rachel	 God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
132	Ross	 (shocked) You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
133	Rachel	 Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)
134	Ross	 (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
135	Rachel	 I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.
136		(Suddenly a siren goes off behind them.)
137	Rachel	 Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
138	Ross	 Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
139	Rachel	 Really? You think so?
140	Ross	 I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
141	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is walking from the bathroom to his bedroom and walks past a pile of Rachel’s laundry, which just happens to include a selection of panties. He stops, goes back to the basket, looks for Rachel, picks up a lavender thong, and heads for his bedroom. However, he decides he doesn’t like his selection and goes back this time picking up a red low-cut silk brief and heads for his room, flexing along the way to prove his masculinity.]
142	[Scene	 Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas and the strip before we arrive at 4 Queens bar, where Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table waiting for the show to start.
143	A Waiter in Drag	 (to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?
144	Monica	 Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter) I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…
145	Waiter in Drag	 (To Chandler) Hm-mmm?
146	Chandler	 Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
147	Waiter in Drag	 You’re straight. I get it. (Walks away.)
148	Monica	 I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
149	Chandler	 No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re here yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides, he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.
150	Monica	 Why not?!
151	Chandler	 I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
152	Monica	 What?!
153	Chandler	 Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
154	Announcer	 Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
155		(There’s applause as Helena turns around and it’s Kathleen Turner.)
156	Helena	 Hello darlings.
157	Chandler	 And there’s daddy!
158		Commercial Break
159	[Scene	 The Porsche, they have pulled over and are waiting for the cop to come talk to them.]
160	Rachel	 Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!
161	Ross	 Yeah, I’ll get right on that.
162	Rachel	 Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
163	Ross	 No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
164		(She sits back up as the policeman approaches. She undoes her top button.)
165	Rachel	 (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
166	Ross	 Oh my God.
167	Policeman	 Can I see your license please?
168	Rachel	 Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.
169	Policeman	 Your license?
170	Rachel	 (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
171	Policeman	 That’s Hanson.
172	Rachel	 Oops sorry, my mistake.
173	Ross	 Dear Lord!!
174	Policeman	 Wow!
175	Ross	 Here it comes.
176	Policeman	 This is a great picture.
177	Rachel	 Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed.
178	Policeman	 Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
179	Ross	 Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
180	Rachel	 Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.
181	Policeman	 Yes I am.
182	Rachel	 Yeah.
183	Policeman	 You’re an Aquarius, huh?
184	Rachel	 I bet you’re a Gemini.
185	Policeman	 Nope.
186	Rachel	 Taurus?
187	Policeman	 Nope.
188	Rachel	 Virgo?
189	Policeman	 Nope.
190	Rachel	 Sagittarius?
191	Policeman	 Yep.
192	Rachel	 I knew it! I knew it, ahh….
193	Policeman	 Well I tell you what…
194	Rachel	 Yeah?
195	Policeman	 You’re not gonna speed anymore right?
196	Rachel	 I won’t speed.
197	Policeman	 And you promise you’ll get this taken care of right away?
198	Rachel	 I promise.
199	Policeman	 And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
200	Rachel	 Yeah!
201	Policeman	 Can he handle the stick?
202	Rachel	 Oh well…
203	Ross	 I can handle the stick!!
204	[Scene	 4 Queens Club, Helena Handbasket is singing.]
205	Helena	 I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…(She holds the mike out to the audience.)
206	All	 Gay!
207	Monica	 That can’t be your father.
208	Chandler	 Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
209	Monica	 What?
210	Chandler	 That’s Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.
211	Helena	 (singing) For I’m loved by a pretty wonderful boy! (Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience.)
212	Chandler	 He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.
213	Monica	 Relax! You’ll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table light.) Oh much better. You’re invisible now.
214	Helena	 (standing at a table and asking the guy sitting there) Where are you from?
215	Guy	 Bakersfield.
216	Helena	 I’m sorry? (Holds out the mike.)
217	Guy	 Bakersfield!
218	Helena	 No-no I heard! I’m just sorry.
219	Chandler	 It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.
220		(He gets up to walk out, but Helena spots and stops him.)
221	Helena	 (to Chandler’s back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around. Helena recognizes him.)
222	Monica	 Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!
223	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Joey enters strutting.]
224	Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
225	Phoebe	 Hey!
226	Joey	 Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
227	Phoebe	 Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
228	Joey	 Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
229	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
230	Joey	 The silk? Feels really good!
231	Phoebe	 Huh.
232	Joey	 Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
233	Phoebe	 That’s great Joe!
234	Joey	 Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!
235	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
236	Joey	 Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?
237	Phoebe	 Hmm?
238	Joey	 Pantyhose! Y’know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… (He mimed that and stops when he realizes he went too far.) I should go take these off shouldn’t I?
239	Phoebe	 I think it’s important that you do.
240		(Joey agrees and heads to take them off.)
241	[Scene	 4 Queens Club, scene continued from earlier.]
242	Helena	 So what’s your name?
243	Chandler	 (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
244	Helena	 Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating parents.
245	Chandler	 Oh, they’re a hoot.
246	Helena	 (To Monica) And who is your friend?
247	Monica	 I’m-I’m Monica.
248	Helena	 Monica! Where are you from?
249	Monica	 New York.
250	Helena	 I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing Monica’s ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who woos.) Honey! Huh?
251	Chandler	 Actually Monica and I are engaged.
252	Helena	 Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day?
253	Monica	 (looks at Chandler) In…in two weeks.
254	Helena	 (disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. (To a bald guy.) So you’re bald?
255	Chandler	 Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
256	Helena	 We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)
257	Chandler	 I know it would make me happy, ma’am.
258	Helena	 Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something. (Goes back on stage.)
259	Monica	 (To Chandler) You okay?
260	Chandler	 Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
261	Helena	 Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life… (Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing else carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing) It’s raining men!
262	The Chorus Line	 Hallelujah!
263	Helena	 It’s raining men!
264	The Chorus Line	 Amen!
265	Chandler	 (To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.
266	[Scene	 The Porsche, cars are whizzing by and honking their horns on both sides very quickly as Ross creeps along.]
267	Rachel	 Remind me to introduce you to someone!
268	Ross	 Who?
269	Rachel	 Fourth gear!!
270		(Suddenly a siren goes off.)
271	Ross	 What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
272	Rachel	 Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.
273	Ross	 Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (They pull over.)
274	Rachel	 It’s a different guy!
275		(The policeman walks up.)
276	Ross	 Good evening officer.
277	Policeman	 Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
278	Ross	 Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty.
279	Policeman	 You’re right. It was 37. (Rachel laughs.)
280	Ross	 I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
281	Policeman	 That’s right.
282		(There’s a pause as Ross gets suddenly flirtatious.)
283	Ross	 Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
284	Rachel	 Oh my God!
285	Policeman	 Your license please.
286	Ross	 (laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?
287	Policeman	 It’s Petty. (He grabs Ross’s license.) I’ll be right back with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)
288	Rachel	 (pause) You have a son!
289	Ross	 I know. I know.
290		Ending Credits
291	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is returning from having removed Rachel’s panties.]
292	Phoebe	 Feel better?
293	Joey	 Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
294	Phoebe	 Yeah, I understand.
295	Joey	 Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!
296	Woman	 Hi!
297	Joey	 Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
298	Woman	 I don’t think so.
299	Joey	 Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives.
300	Woman	 Wow!
301	Joey	 Yeah.
302	Woman	 Really?!
303	Joey	 Hm-mmm.
304	Waitress	 (to the woman) $4.50 please.
305	Joey	 Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.
