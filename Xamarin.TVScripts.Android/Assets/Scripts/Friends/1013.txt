12	Chandler	 So, where's Mike?
13	Phoebe	 Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
14	Joey	 Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
15	Phoebe	 Oh, why? What's up?
16	Joey	 I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
17	Ross	 Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
18	Monica	 Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
19	Ross	 (whispering) It was ok...
20	Rachel	 I did not know you spoke French.
21	Phoebe	 Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
22	Rachel	 Oh... you're so sexy!
23	Joey	 Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
24	Phoebe	 Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.

26	OPENING CREDITS [Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment.] Chandler
27	Monica	 Hey.
28	Chandler	 Why are you wearing my apron?
29	Monica	 I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
30	Chandler	 Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
31	Ross	 (he enters) Hey.
32	Monica	 Hey.
33	Ross	 You guys know where Rachel is?
34	Monica	 No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
35	Ross	 So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
36	Monica	 Hey!
37	Ross	 Hey!
38	Monica	 These are for Erica!
39	Ross	 What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
40	Monica	 Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
41	Ross	 So, why is Erica coming to visit?
42	Monica	 Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
43	Chandler	 Oh, those places! There's always so many people, they're being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
44	Monica	 Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
45	Ross	 (looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
46	Rachel	 Ross...
47	Ross	 No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
48	Rachel	 My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.
49	Ross	 Oh my God.
50	Monica	 Honey.
51	Chandler	 I'm so sorry...
52	Ross	 Is-is he ok?
53	Rachel	 Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
54	Ross	 Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
55	Rachel	 No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
56	Ross	 Still-still, let me come... for me.
57	Rachel	 Ok. If you really need to.
58	Ross	 I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
59	Rachel	 Oh, I really could.
60	Ross	 Oh!
61	Rachel	 Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)

84	Joey	 Hi.
85	Monica	 Everyone. Erica, baby!
86	Chandler	 Monica. Calm, self.
87	Erica	 Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
88	Joey	 Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
89	Chandler	 Why would you say that?
90	Phoebe	 Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
91	Erica	 I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
92	Joey	 Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
93	Erica	 Oh yeah, let's do that!
94	Chandler	 Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better be really good.
95	[Scene	 Hospital.] Rachel
96	Ross	 And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
97	Rachel	 Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
98	Rachel	 Can somebody please go in?
99	Nurse	 Absolutely.
100	Ross	 Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
101	Rachel	 Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
102	Ross	 I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
103	Nurse	 He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
104	Ross	 I'm feeling better.
105	Rachel	 Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
106	Nurse	 Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
107	Rachel	 Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
108	Ross	 He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
109	Rachel (leaving)	 Ok.
110		(Ross goes into the room where Dr. Green is laying unconscious. He turns on the TV, puts his feet on the bed and starts watching a dinosaur movie where the dinosaur is caught by two cowboys. Dr. Geller awakes.)
111	Ross	 Did the TV wake you?
112	Dr. Green	 No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
113	Ross	 Ouchy.
114	Dr. Green	 What are you doing here, Geller?
115	Ross	 Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) So what's new?
116	Dr. Green	 Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
117	Ross	 Right, is it painful?
118	Dr. Green	 What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
119		Ross (he buzzes for the nurse) Let's see if we can get that Rachel back here.
120	Dr. Green	 So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
121	Ross	 Nope, just the one. RACH!
122	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Phoebe is trying to teach Joey French.] Phoebe
123	Joey	 Je do call blue!
124	Phoebe	 Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
125	Joey	 je.
126	Phoebe	 m'ap
127	Joey	 mah
128	Phoebe	 pelle

135	Joey	 pel.
136	Phoebe	 Je m'appelle!
137	Joey	 Me pooh pooh!
138	Phoebe	 Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
139	Joey	 What are you doing?
140	Phoebe	 I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. (she leaves)
141	Joey	 (he goes out calling her) Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! (he gives up). Pooh.
142	[Scene	 Green's mansion. Rachel's Room. Rachel's is combing her hair; Ross's coming into the room] Ross
143	Rachel	 Hi!
144	Ross	 I w!s gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
145	Rachel	 Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
146	Ross	 Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
147	Rachel	 Oh good.
148	Ross	 Wow.
149	Rachel	 What?
150	Ross	 Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
151	Rachel	 What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
152	Ross	 Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
153	Rachel	 Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
154	Ross	 Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
155	Rachel	 Yeah.
156	Ross	 You had a rough day, uh?
157	Rachel	 Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
158	Ross	 But we do! (pause) It's gonna be ok, Rach!
159	Rachel	 (she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
160	Ross	 What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
161	Rachel	 What?
162	Ross	 They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
163	Rachel	 Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
164	Ross	 No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
165	Rachel	 Ok, maybe you're right.
166	Ross	 (he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
167	Rachel	 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
168	Ross	 Sure!
169	Rachel	 Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her)<+i> Thank you for coming with me today.
170	Ross	 Oh, of course...
171	Rachel	 Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
172	Ross	 Me too. Come here. (They hug)
173	Rachel	 I just don't want to be alone tonight.
174	Ross	 Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
175	Rachel	 Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
176	Ross	 No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
177	Rachel	 Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
178	Ross	 Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
179	Rachel	 Wow. Ok.
180	Ross	 I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).
181	Rachel	 Mhm-mh!
182	Ross	 (outside her room, talking by (imself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
183	[Scene	 Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica have just arrived.] Erica
184	Monica	 Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
185	Chandler	 (enters the room wearing an "I love New York" t-shirt, a "Statue of Liberty" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
186	Monica	 What is with you?
187	Chandler	 Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
188	Monica	 Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
189	Erica	 Thanks so much for showing me around.
190	Monica	 Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
191	Erica	 Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)
192	Chandler	 Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
193	Erica	 Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)
194	Chandler	 That's great.
195	Erica	 Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)
196	Monica	 How's that now?
197	Erica	 Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
198	Chandler	 So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
199	Erica	 No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)
200	Monica	 Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)
201	Erica	 No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy.
202	Chandler	 I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
203		(Time lapse. Chandler and Monica are in bed now)
204	Monica	 Are you awake?
205	Chandler	 Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
206	Monica	 Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
207	Chandler	 Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
208	Monica	 Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
209	Chandler	 I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
210	Monica	 How?
211	Chandler	 I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
212	Monica	 Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
213	Chandler	 Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
214	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. He is sitting on the barcalounger holding a French study book and listening to a French learning tape.] Tape
215	Joey	 Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
216	Tape	 Good job.
217	Joey	 Thank you.
218		(Phoebe enters)
219	Phoebe	 Hey Joey.
220	Joey	 Hey!
221	Phoebe	 Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
222	Joey	 Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
223	Phoebe	 Really, can I hear some of it.
224	Joey	 Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?
225	Phoebe	 Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
226	Joey	 (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
227	Phoebe	 How could you possibly think that?
228	Joey	 For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
229	[Scene	 The hospital. Rachel is pouring her self a cup of coffee. Ross approaches from behind.] Ross
230	Rachel	 (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
231	Ross	 You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
232	Rachel	 Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)
233	Ross	 You sure you're alright?
234	Rachel	 (coldly) Yep.
235	Ross	 (knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
236	Rachel	 FYI..
237	Ross	 (knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
238	Rachel	 In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
239	Ross	 (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
240	Rachel	 (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
241	Ross	 (acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
242	Rachel	 Oh stop that!
243	Ross	 I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
244	Rachel	 (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. (She walks around him to the other side)
245	<">Ross	 Hey, I was looking out for you.
246	Rachel	 Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
247	Ross	 I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
248	Rachel	 Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
249	Ross	 Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
250	Rachel	 What?
251	Ross	 That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)
252	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Erica enter, Chandler is in the kitchen.] Chandler
253	Erica	 (To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)
254	Chandler	 (struggling) Oh, really?
255	Erica	 No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
256	Chandler	 O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
257	Monica	 Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
258	Chandler	 Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
259	Monica	 (smiling) No it's not.
260	Chandler	 How do you know?
261	Erica	 Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
262	Chandler	 Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
263	Monica	 The thing we never do.
264	Chandler	 (nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
265	[Scene	 The theatre where Joey is auditioning. Phoebe enters when Joey's on stage and she sits down. He hasn't seen her.] Director
266	Joey	 Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
267	Casting assistant	 I'm sorry, what's going on?
268	Joey	 Dude, come on! French it u-up!
269	Director	 Joey, do you speak French?
270	Joey	 Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
271	Director	 You know what. I think this audition is over. (Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)
272	Phoebe	 (in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
273	Director	 You really think this man is speaking French?
274	Joey	 Sa-sa-saw!
275	Phoebe	 Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. (Translation
276		(The director looks at Joey and he nods.)
277	<">Phoebe	 Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation
278	Director	 (to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
279	Joey	 Ah. All right. But my French was good?
280	Director	 It was great.
281	Joey	 (to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
282	Phoebe	 (to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation
283	Joey	 Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
284	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting at the kitchen counter and Ross enters from Rachel and Emma's room.] Ross
285	Rachel	 Oh, good.
286	Ross	 So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
287	Rachel	 Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
288	Ross	 Oh, no problem.
289	Rachel	 And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
290	Ross	 Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
291	Rachel	 It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
292	Ross	 Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
293	Rachel	 Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
294	Ross	 Oh, ye-ah!
295	Rachel	 You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
296	Ross	 ...Valentine's day...
297	Both	 (long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!
298	Rachel	 Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
299	Ross	 Hmmm-mmmm.
300	Rachel	 (after a pause) Not even one more time?
301	Ross	 Not even once.
302	Rachel	 No matter how much we want it.
303	Ross	 Even if we want it really bad.
304	Rachel	 That's what we decided.
305	Ross	 Uhm, right!
306	Rachel	 ...It's kinda hard though!
307	Ross	 Yeah.
308	Rachel	 You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
309	Ross	 ...I hate waste.
310	Rachel	 ...Ross?
311	Ross	 Yes?
312	Rachel	 Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
313	Ross	 Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)
314	COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Joey are "updating" Joey's resumé.] Phoebe
315	Joey	 No.
316	Phoebe	 It's off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
317	Phoebe	 Archery?
318	Joey	 No.
319	Phoebe	 Horseback riding?
320	Joey	 Would fall off a lot.
321	Phoebe	 You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
322	Joey	 That I can do.
323	Phoebe	 Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
324	Joey	 Al, right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?
325	Phoebe	 Ready... GO!
326		(Joey takes the plastic container to his mouth and starts to drink. Most of the milk gushes from the bottle down his chin and over his clothes to the floor. He keeps "drinking" and all of a sudden he lifts it up and half the bottle of milk pours out in an instant. He then continues to drink the rest. He then puts the empty container down on the counter.)
327	Phoebe	 (checking her watch) You did it!
328		THE END
