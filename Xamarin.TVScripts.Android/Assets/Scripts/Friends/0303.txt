2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting reading a book and hears the bed in Joey's room creaking, and does a 'Oh no, not again' look on his face.]
3	Joey	 (from bedroom) WHOAA!!
4	Chandler	 (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
5		Opening Credits
6	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]
7	Monica	 Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
8	Ross	 Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
9	Monica	 Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
10	Rachel	 I didn't know there were docks.
11		[Joey and Chandler enter]
12	Joey	 Hey.
13	Chandler	 Hey.
14	Ross	 Aww, is it broken?
15	Joey	 No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)
16	Rachel	 Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
17	Joey	 Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
18	Chandler	 Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
19	Joey	 What is this? Fruit?
20	Rachel	 Monica's making jam.
21	Joey	 Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
22	Chandler	 Because the kids need new shoes.
23	Monica	 I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
24	Joey	 This will just be my batch.
25	[Scene	 Street, Phoebe is being followed by some guy, as they pass a flower vendor. Phoebe turns around and the guy quickly picks up some flowers and continues following her.]
26	Phoebe	 (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
27	Guy	 You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
28	Phoebe	 What?
29	Guy	 One more chance Ursula, please?
30	Phoebe	 Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
31	Guy	 Wh..
32	Phoebe	 Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
33	Guy	 Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
34	Phoebe	 Oh, you're not a dingus.
35	Guy	 I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
36	Phoebe	 Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
37	Guy	 Well thanks. (starts to leave)
38	Phoebe	 Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
39	Guy	 Not really.
40	Phoebe	 Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
41	Guy	 Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)
42	Phoebe	 Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
43	Guy	 Yeah, okay.
44	Phoebe	 Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
45	Guy	 Sorry.
46	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]
47	Rachel	 Mon?
48	Ross	 Mon?
49	Rachel	 (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
50	Ross	 Wait a minute, look.
51	Rachel	 What?
52	Ross	 Look, look, look.
53	Rachel	 What, what, what?
54	Ross	 It's an empty apartment.
55	Rachel	 Oooh.
56	Ross	 We're all alone in an empty apartment.
57	Rachel	 Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. (they fall onto the couch)
58		(Chandler enters and they both jump up and pretend that Ross is showing her something in the couch.)
59	Ross	 There it is.
60	Rachel	 Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.
61	Ross	 Hey.
62	Chandler	 Do I look fat?
63	Ross and Rachel	 Noo.
64	Chandler	 Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
65	Rachel	 Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
66	Chandler	 Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
67	Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
68	Rachel	 Nooo!
69	Ross	 And it works both ways.
70	Chandler	 Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
71	Rachel	 Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
72	Ross	 Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
73	Chandler	 That's easy, baggage claim.
74	Ross	 (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
75	Chandler	 Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
76	Rachel	 Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.
77	Ross	 Oh.
78	Rachel	 All right are you guys gonna come down?
79	Ross	 Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
80	Rachel	 Good luck Chandler.
81	Chandler	 Thank you Rachel.
82	Ross	 Bye sweetie.
83	Rachel	 Bye hon.
84	Ross	 (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
85	Chandler	 Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
86	Ross	 Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...
87	Chandler	 Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
88	Ross	 I'm gonna use the cushion.
89	Chandler	 Yeah.
90	Ross	 Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
91	Chandler	 Okay, the old hug and roll.
92	Ross	 Yep.
93	Chandler	 Okay, one question.
94	Ross	 Shoot.
95	Chandler	 You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
96	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam]
97	Joey	 Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
98	Rachel	 (Looks at him) You're so pretty.
99	Phoebe	 (entering) Hi!
100	All	 Hey, Phoebe.
101	Phoebe	 Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
102	Joey	 (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
103	Phoebe	 Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
104	Chandler	 Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
105	Phoebe	 Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
106	Ross	 Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
107	Phoebe	 No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
108	Joey	 (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)
109	Phoebe	 Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
110	Monica	 (entering) Hey guys.
111	All	 Hey Mon.
112	Monica	 Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.
113	Joey	 Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!
114	Chandler	 Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
115	Joey	 Put your hands together.
116	Monica	 Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
117	Joey	 No more jam?!
118	Rachel	 Well, what happened to your jam plan?
119	Monica	 I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
120	Chandler	 Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
121	Ross	 What are you talking about?
122	Monica	 I'm talking about me having a baby.
123	Ross	 What?
124	Rachel	 Are you serious?
125	Monica	 Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
126	Ross	 Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
127	Monica	 It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
128	Chandler	 That, that's what's stupid.
129	Monica	 I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
130	Rachel	 Down at the docks again?
131	[Scene	 Chandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling]
132	Janice	 Night-night Bing-a-ling.
133	Chandler	 Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
134		Commercial Break
135	[Scene	 Central Perk, Malcom is giving Phoebe all of his spy stuff]
136	Malcom	 Here's my binoculars.
137	Phoebe	 Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
138	Malcom	 These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
139	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)
140	Malcom	 Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
141	Phoebe	 Um, not even a little bit.
142	Malcom	 It's about you.
143	Phoebe	 Oh, okay then.
144	Malcom	 (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
145	Phoebe	 Good. So what were you thinking?
146	Malcom	 I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
147	Phoebe	 Really?
148	Malcom	 No.
149	Phoebe	 Oh.
150	Malcom	 See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
151	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. (he kisses her)
152	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and Chandler is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.]
153	Chandler	 No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
154	Monica	 (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
155	Chandler	 You mean there's more than one of us.
156	Ross	 Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
157	Monica	 You're gonna what?
158	Ross	 I'm gonna tell Mom.
159	Rachel	 Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
160	Ross	 Crazy.
161	Monica	 What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
162	Ross	 (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...
163	Monica	 Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
164	Joey	 Check it out!! Jam crackers!
165	Monica	 Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments
166	Joey	 Yeah, the Knicks rule!
167	Monica	 Joey, this is you!
168	Joey	 Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.
169	Rachel	 When did you go to a sperm bank?
170	Joey	 Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
171	Chandler	 And that's how you bought it?
172	Joey	 Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
173	Monica	 Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
174	Joey	 Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
175	Phoebe	 (entering) Hellooo!
176	All	 Hey.
177	Ross	 How's the maniac?
178	Phoebe	 Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
179	Rachel	 Phoebe, what are you doing?
180	Phoebe	 Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
181	Rachel	 Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
182	Phoebe	 Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
183	Ross	 You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
184	Phoebe	 What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
185	Chandler	 Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
186	Phoebe	 What are you saying I should do?
187	Monica	 I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
188	Phoebe	 Thank you, Monica.
189	Joey	 Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
190	Monica	 Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
191	[Scene	 Central Perk]
192	Rachel	 Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)
193	Janice	 Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
194	Rachel	 Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
195	Janice	 Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
196	Rachel	 (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?
197	Janice	 You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
198	[Scene	 Subway station, Phoebe is following Malcom by finding behind the pillars until she comes up to one with a wire mesh garbage can next to it. Malcom stops and starts walking the other way and passes Phoebe, who quick tries to hide behind the garbage can. But, Malcom sees her.]
199	Malcom	 Phoebe?
200	Phoebe	 Yes? Yes! Oh.
201	Malcom	 What are you doing?
202	Phoebe	 Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)
203	Malcom	 Were you following me?
204	Phoebe	 Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
205	Malcom	 So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)
206	Phoebe	 Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
207	Malcom	 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
208	Phoebe	 No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
209	Malcom	 Uh-huh, I don't know.
210	Phoebe	 Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
211	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering]
212	Joey	 Hey.
213	Monica	 Hey.
214	Joey	 Where you going?
215	Monica	 To the bank.
216	Joey	 Sperm or regular?
217	Monica	 Sperm.
218	Joey	 So you're really doing this, huh?
219	Monica	 Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
220	Joey	 Sounds nice.
221	Monica	 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
222	Joey	 No kiddin', hmm.
223	Monica	 What?
224	Joey	 No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
225	Monica	 Really? Why?
226	Joey	 I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
227	Monica	 Hoyt?
228	Joey	 It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
229	Monica	 Really, is he a swimmer?
230	Joey	 He's got the body for it.
231	Monica	 I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
232	Joey	 You guys have one of those signs that says
233	Monica	 We do not have one of those signs.
234	Joey	 Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
235	Monica	 Two girls and a boy?
236	Joey	 Yeah!
237	Monica	 And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
238	Joey	 Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
239	Monica	 Yeah.
240	Joey	 Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again).
241		Closing Credits
242	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is finishing off the last of the jam]
243	Joey	 I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if they met me in person.
244	Rachel	 Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
245	Joey	 (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
246	Rachel	 Yeah.
247	Ross	 (entering) Hello.
248	Rachel	 Hello.
249	Ross	 (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
250	Chandler	 Sure. What's up?
251	Ross	 Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)
