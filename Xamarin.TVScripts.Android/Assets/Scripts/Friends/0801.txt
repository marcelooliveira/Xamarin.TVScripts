2	[Scene	 The Wedding Hall, Monica and Chandler have just said "I do," and the photographer is taking the required pictures. First of Monica, Chandler, Ross and Joey.]
3	Photographer	 Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
4	Monica	 Okay.
5	Ross	 (To Monica) Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you!
6	Joey	 What? What’s going on?
7	Ross	 Monica’s pregnant!
8	Joey	 Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
9	Monica	 Guys! I’m not pregnant.
10	Joey	 Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)
11	Ross	 What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?
12	Monica	 You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!
13	Ross	 No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)
14	Photographer	 Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
15	Monica	 (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
16	Joey	 I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.
17	Monica	 Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)
18	Photographer	 Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
19	Phoebe	 Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?
20	Monica	 Because I’m not.
21	Phoebe	 We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant—(She sees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am.
22		(Flash, the photographer takes a picture of Monica and Chandler’s stunned faces.)
23	Chandler	 What?! What are you talking about?
24	Monica	 What are you talking about?
25	Phoebe	 Yes, I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.
26	Monica	 Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
27	Chandler	 Who’s the father?
28	Monica	 Yeah!
29	Phoebe	 I can’t say.
30	Monica	 Why?!
31	Chandler	 Why not?
32	Phoebe	 I can’t say because he’s famous.
33	Rachel	 Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)
34	Monica	 Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
35	Phoebe	 Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
36	Chandler	 As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
37	Phoebe	 What?! Well he never said that to me!
38		Opening Credits
39	[Scene	 The Wedding Hall, continued from earlier.]
40	Photographer	 Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.
41	Phoebe	 How about just the bridemaids?
42	Chandler	 Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
43	Phoebe	 It is.
44	Rachel	 For you. (Chandler leaves.)
45	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
46	Rachel	 Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.
47	Phoebe	 So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
48	Rachel	 You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you.
49	Phoebe	 Sneaky.
50	Rachel	 Oh yeah.
51	Photographer	 Smile ladies.
52	Rachel	 Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
53	Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.
54	Rachel	 James Brolin?
55	Phoebe	 Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.
56	Rachel	 Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
57	Phoebe	 (intrigued) Really?!
58	[Scene	 The Reception Hall, the party is in full swing.]
59	Bandleader	 Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!
60		(They enter.)
61	Chandler	 Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
62	Monica	 Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!
63	Chandler	 No?
64	Monica	 No.
65	Chandler	 I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
66	Monica	 What?!
67	Chandler	 Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
68	Monica	 Oh that is so sweet!
69	Chandler	 So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
70	Monica	 Yes.
71		(They walk onto the dance floor and Chandler slips and almost falls.)
72	Monica	 What’s the matter?
73	Chandler	 I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery.
74	Monica	 Well, are you going to be able to do this?
75	Chandler	 Not well.
76		(They start dancing and Chandler starts slipping around.)
77	Monica	 Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us.
78		[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel at their table.]
79	Phoebe	 So, are you ready to talk about it?
80	Rachel	 No.
81		(Pause)
82	Phoebe	 Now?
83	Rachel	 No!
84	Phoebe	 Okay, we’ll talk about something else then.
85	Rachel	 Thank you.
86	Phoebe	 Who’s the father?!
87	Rachel	 Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.
88	Phoebe	 Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?
89	Rachel	 Phoebe!!
90	Phoebe	 Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop.
91	Rachel	 Okay.
92	Phoebe	 Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!
93	Rachel	 Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
94	Phoebe	 Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.
95		[Cut to Joey entering wearing a preppy tennis outfit.]
96	Monica	 (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
97	Joey	 I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?
98	Monica	 Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)
99		[Cut to the hallway outside the room, Ross is going to see which table he’s at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]
100	Ross	 Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.
101	Woman	 Oh hi, I’m, I’m Mona from her restaurant.
102	Ross	 Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
103	Mona	 You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it.
104	Ross	 Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
105	Mona	 Uh-huh.
106	Ross	 Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
107	Mona	 Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
108	Ross	 Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.
109	Mona	 Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name.
110	Ross	 (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken.
111		[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]
112	Joey	 That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)
113		[Cut to Chandler sitting down near Joey as his mom walks over. His birth mother, not the mother who recently visited one of those clinics in Sweden.]
114	Mrs. Bing	 Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
115	Dennis Phillips	 Congratulations.
116	Chandler	 Thank you.
117	Mrs. Bing	 Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
118	Chandler	 Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
119	Dennis Phillips	 Oh, I’m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.
120	Mrs. Bing	 Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
121	Joey	 I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani.
122	Dennis Phillips	 Dennis Phillips
123	Joey	 Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff.
124	Dennis Phillips	 Oh, thank you. Well if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)
125	Joey	 Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?
126	Mrs. Bing	 Well, it’s a funny story.
127	Chandler	 Funny
128		[Time lapse. The band is finishing another song.]
129	Bandleader	 Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
130		(Ross starts looking for table six and finds out that it’s the kid’s table. He sees Mona sitting at another table.)
131	Ross	 Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
132	Mona	 No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)
133	Ross	 Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.
134		[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]
135	Joey	 Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.
136	Chandler	 What size shoes do you wear?
137	Joey	 Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
138	Chandler	 Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
139	Joey	 Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.
140	Chandler	 (looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half.
141	Joey	 Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!
142		[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]
143	Monica	 Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
144	Rachel	 Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?
145	Monica	 This is so huge.
146	Rachel	 Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
147	Monica	 Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…
148	Rachel	 Yeah.
149	Monica	 …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
150	Rachel	 Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
151	Monica	 How?
152	Rachel	 I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
153	Monica	 Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
154	Rachel	 Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.
155	Monica	 Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.
156	Rachel	 Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
157	Monica	 Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
158	Rachel	 (starting to cry) I don’t know.
159	Monica	 Are you okay?
160	Rachel	 Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
161	Waiter	 Champagne?
162	Rachel	 Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.
163		(Monica gasps.)
164		Commercial Break
165	[Scene	 continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]
166	Phoebe	 Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…
167	Monica	 Oh really?!
168	Phoebe	 Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said…
169	Monica	 (interrupting) Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.
170	Phoebe	 (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
171	Monica	 How do you feel?
172	Rachel	 I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!
173	Phoebe	 Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.
174	Rachel	 What?!
175	Phoebe	 When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
176	Monica	 Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
177	Rachel	 How many ways are there to do that?
178	Phoebe	 I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.
179	Rachel	 All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.
180	Monica	 You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
181	Rachel	 Okay. Thank you.
182	Monica	 Okay.
183	Phoebe	 I’ll run out and get you one.
184	Rachel	 Oh, you guys are so great.
185	Monica	 Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?!
186	Phoebe	 Oh no, she won’t tell us.
187	Monica	 Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present.
188	Rachel	 Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
189	Phoebe	 See? This is why you register.
190		[Cut to Ross at the kiddie table. He reaches for something and a fart noise emanates which causes the kids to laugh.]
191	Ross	 It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.
192	Mona	 Hi!
193	Ross	 Umm, would you like to dance?
194	Mona	 Sure.
195	Ross	 Yeah?
196	Mona	 Yeah.
197	Ross	 Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
198	Little Girl	 Dr. Geller?
199	Ross	 I wasn’t farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?
200	Little Girl	 Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
201	Ross	 Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady.
202	Little Girl	 Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)
203	Mona	 Ohhhh!
204	Ross	 Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.
205	Mona	 I’d be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.
206	Ross	 Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
207	Little Girl	 Sure!
208	Ross	 Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?
209	Little Girl	 Uh-huh.
210	Ross	 Keep dancing.
211		[Cut to Chandler in the hallway practicing dancing and is doing it very well.]
212	Chandler	 And the world will never know.
213	Joey	 Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
214	Chandler	 Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
215	Joey	 No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.
216	Chandler	 But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
217	Joey	 Hey!
218		[Joey walks back inside just as Ross’s dance is finishing.]
219	Little Girl	 Thank you.
220	Ross	 No-no, thank you Miranda.
221	Little Girl	 Melinda!
222	Ross	 All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
223	Mona	 How cute was that?
224	Ross	 Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
225		(Another little girl walks over to him.)
226	Second Girl	 Can I go next?
227	Ross	 What? Of course you can! Hop on!
228	Mona	 Okay, but I get to hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)
229	Ross	 I am so gonna score.
230	Second Girl	 What?
231	Ross	 I like your bow.
232		[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]
233	Joey	 (clinks his glass) I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!
234		[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]
235	Bandleader	 Thank you.
236	Ross	 (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
237	Ashley	 Can we do it again?
238	Ross	 No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)
239	Mona	 So, is it my turn now?
240		(A large little fat girl walks over.)
241	Fat Girl	 I’m next!
242	Ross	 Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
243	Mona	 Uh, that’s okay. You can dance with her first.
244	Ross	 Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name.
245	Fat Girl	 Gert!
246	Ross	 That’s, that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
247	Gert	 Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
248	Ross	 Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
249	Gert	 Why aren’t you moving your feet?
250	Ross	 I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
251	Gert	 Faster! You’re not going fast enough!
252	Ross	 Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
253		[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]
254	Joey	 So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
255	Dennis Phillips	 Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
256	Joey	 Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…
257	Dennis Phillips	 Look umm Joey, I-I don’t think you’re quite right for this project.
258	Joey	 Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.
259	Dennis Phillips	 It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
260	Joey	 Well I’m not proud of this, but… (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)
261	Dennis Phillips	 Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don’t-don’t-don’t!
262		[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]
263	Monica	 Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
264	Chandler	 Did it turn into sand?
265	Monica	 Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)
266	Chandler	 (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
267	Monica	 Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.
268		(Mr. Geller dances over.)
269	Mr. Geller	 Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested.
270	Chandler	 Why?
271	Mr. Geller	 You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)
272	[Scene	 The Women’s Restroom, Rachel and Phoebe are waiting for the outcome of Rachel’s second test.]
273	Rachel	 How much longer?
274	Phoebe	 30 seconds.
275	Rachel	 30 seconds, okay.
276	Monica	 (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna…
277	Rachel	 Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
278	Phoebe	 It’s time.
279		(Another woman starts to enter.)
280	The Girls	 No!! (The woman backs out.)
281	Monica	 Go ahead Rach.
282		(She goes over to look.)
283	Rachel	 Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
284	Phoebe	 Okay.
285	Rachel	 Okay.
286	Phoebe	 Umm, it’s negative.
287	Rachel	 What?
288	Phoebe	 It’s negative.
289	Rachel	 Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.
290	Monica	 Well… Well, great.
291	Phoebe	 Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
292	Rachel	 Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?
293	Phoebe	 No, it’s positive.
294	Rachel	 What?!
295	Phoebe	 It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive.
296	Rachel	 Are you sure?
297	Phoebe	 Well yeah, I lied before.
298	Rachel	 Oh!
299	Monica	 Oh God…
300	Phoebe	 Now you know how you really feel about it.
301	Rachel	 Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!
302	Monica	 Are you really gonna do this?
303	Rachel	 Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)
304	Phoebe	 With who?
305	Rachel	 Ah, it’s still not the time.
306		Dedicated to the People of New York City
307		Closing Credits
308	[Scene	 The Reception, Joey is helping Ross walk after Gert got through with him and Mona is looking on concerned.]
309	Ross	 I just didn’t see the fast song coming.
310	Joey	 Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.
311	Ross	 Oh, thank you.
312	Mona	 That is so sweet!
313	Joey	 Yeah.
314	Mona	 No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
315	Joey	 Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself.
316	Mona	 It’s Joey right?
317	Joey	 Yeah.
318	Ross	 Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)
