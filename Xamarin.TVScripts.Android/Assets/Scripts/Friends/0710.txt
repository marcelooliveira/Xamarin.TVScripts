2	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is on the phone, Rachel and Monica are sitting in the kitchen.]
3	Chandler	 Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
4	Monica	 Betrothed… (Corrects him)
5	Chandler	 …betrothed couple.
6	Phoebe	 (entering carrying a skull) Hey!
7	Chandler	 Hey!
8	Rachel and Monica	 Hi!
9	Phoebe	 Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
10	Chandler	 Pheebs?
11	Phoebe	 Huh?
12	Chandler	 Skull?
13	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
14	Rachel	 (freaking out) Oh my god!!
15	Phoebe	 No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)
16	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
17	All	 Hey!
18	Monica	 (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
19	Ross	 (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
20	All	 Ohh! That's great!
21	Monica	 Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
22	Ross	 Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
23	Phoebe	 And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
24	Rachel	 You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
25	Ross	 Hmm.
26		(Joey comes out of the bathroom reading a newspaper)
27	Joey	 Hey. (He exits)
28	Rachel	 (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
29	Monica	 No.
30	Chandler	 How long have we been home?
31	Monica	 About a half an hour.
32	Chandler	 Lovely!
33		Opening Credits
34	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler gets a cup of coffee and sits down next to Monica.]
35	Chandler	 Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
36	Monica	 No.
37	Chandler	 Why not?
38	Monica	 Bing's weird.
39	Phoebe	 (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!
40	Chandler	 Hey!
41	Monica	 Hey!
42	Phoebe	 Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
43	Monica	 Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
44	Phoebe	 Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
45	Chandler	 Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
46	Phoebe	 Yeah, why not?
47	Chandler	 Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
48	Phoebe	 Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
49	Chandler	 No reason, except…she…told…me.
50	Phoebe	 Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
51	Chandler	 No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
52	Monica	 Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
53	Phoebe	 You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
54	Monica	 Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
55	Phoebe	 Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
56	Chandler	 Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
57	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel’s, Joey is sitting behind a red drum set.]
58	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
59	Joey	 Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! (Starts drumming.)
60	Rachel	 Drums?
61	Joey	 (yelling) No! Drums!
62	[Scene	 Michelle's, Chandler and Monica enter.]
63	Chandler	 (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)
64	Monica	 I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
65	Maitre d'	 Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
66	Chandler	 Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8
67	Maitre d'	 I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
68	Chandler	 Is this because of the burrito thing?
69	Monica	 (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
70	Chandler	 Give him money? It was a joke!
71	Monica	 No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
72	Chandler	 Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
73	Monica	 You've got to be smooth about it.
74	Chandler	 Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
75	Maitre d'	 Of course, sir.
76	Chandler	 Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
77	Monica	 How did it go?
78	Chandler	 Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)
79	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Ross is whirling Ben around.]
80	Ross	 Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
81	Ben	 No.
82	Ross	 Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
83	Ben	 Christmas.
84	Ross	 Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
85	Ben	 Christmas eve.
86	Ross	 Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn’t.) Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
87	Ben	 Santa has reindeers that can fly!
88	Ross	 Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
89	Ben	 (singing) Jingle bells, jingle bells...
90	Ross	 (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (Sings) Draydl, draydl, draydl, I made you out of clay.
91	Ben	 (singing) Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
92	Ross	 (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.
93	Ben	 When is Santa coming?
94	Ross	 Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
95	Ben	 No Santa? Was I bad?
96	Ross	 No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
97	Ben	 Santa's mad at me.
98	Ross	 No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
99	Ben	 So Santa's coming?
100	Ross	 (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
101	[Scene	 Michelle's, Chandler and Monica are discussing how to bribe the Maitre d'.]
102	Monica	 It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
103	Chandler	 How do you know so much about this?
104	Monica	 I don't know.
105	Chandler	 Richard used to do it, didn't he?
106	Monica	 We'd be eating our soup right now.
107	Chandler	 Mustached bastard…
108	Monica	 (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
109	Chandler	 (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
110		[Chandler can't find his money in the pocket. In the meantime, another couple shows up, and Chandler turns away to look for his money]
111	Male Guest	 (to the Maitre d') Good evening. (Shakes his hand)
112	Chandler	 (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)
113	[Scene	 The Hallway, Phoebe comes up the stairs and hears drumming coming from Joey and Rachel's, so she enters smiling and then sees that Rachel, not Joey, is the one playing.]
114	Rachel	 (stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!
115	Phoebe	 So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
116	Joey	 Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel) Ready? One, two, three, four...
117		[Rachel hits some tom-toms and ends up on the 'crash'-cymbal, which is in fact a ride-cymbal, but whatever...]
118	Rachel and Joey	 Tequila!!
119	Phoebe	 That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
120		Commercial Break
121	[Scene	 Central Perk, Gunther is serving Chandler and Monica coffee.]
122	Gunther	 Here you go.
123	Chandler	 Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
124	Joey	 Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey Pheebs!
125	Phoebe	 Hey!
126	Joey	 Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.
127	Chandler	 Hey Pheebs!
128	Phoebe	 Hey! (she sits down next to him)
129	Chandler	 If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
130	Monica	 It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
131	Phoebe	 Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
132	Monica	 Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
133	Phoebe	 Maybe on some level.
134	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sitting behind the drums wearing safety goggles, hitting them with his sticks as Rachel watches.]
135	Rachel	 Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
136	Joey	 What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
137	Phoebe	 (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)
138	Joey	 Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what is it?
139	Phoebe	 It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
140	Rachel	 What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
141	Joey	 Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into his room)
142	Rachel	 Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
143	Phoebe	 (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)
144	Rachel	 What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
145	Phoebe	 Our apartment is ready.
146	Rachel	 And that makes you angry because…
147	Phoebe	 Because you would rather live here with Joey.
148	Rachel	 Where did you get that?
149	Phoebe	 Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
150	Rachel	 Phoebe?
151	Phoebe	 Hm?
152	Rachel	 Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
153	Phoebe	 (nods along) Fish!
154	Rachel	 It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
155	Phoebe	 Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…
156	Rachel	 Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
157	Phoebe	 We did have fun, didn't we?
158	Rachel	 We did!
159	Phoebe	 Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
160	Rachel	 Oh, I would love to!
161	Phoebe	 Yay, okay!
162	Rachel	 Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
163	Phoebe	 Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
164	Rachel	 (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!
165	[Scene	 Halloween Adventure, a costume shop, there is a salesman behind the counter, Ross enters.]
166	Ross	 Hey!
167	Salesman	 Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
168	Ross	 No, these are my pants.
169	Salesman	 Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
170	Ross	 Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
171	Salesman	 Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
172	Ross	 Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.
173	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just opened the door for Ross who is costumed as an Armadillo. Ben is standing next to her.]
174	Ross	 I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
175	Monica	 What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
176	Ross	 (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
177	Monica	 Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.
178	Ben	 Texas?
179	Ross	 That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
180		[Monica picks up the bag, while Ross closes the door and hits Monica with his tail. They walk into the living room, and Monica empties the bag.]
181	Ben	 Wow! Thanks!
182	Ross	 You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
183	Ben	 Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
184	Ross	 (gasps) You are? Me, too!
185	Monica	 Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
186	Ross	 (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
187	Ben	 Cool!
188	Ross	 Yeah!
189	Monica	 Come on Ben.
190		[Monica and Ben sit down on the couch.]
191	Ross	 Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
192	Chandler	 (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
193	Ben	 Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
194	Chandler	 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
195	Ross	 What are you doing here, Santa?
196	Chandler	 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?
197	Ross	 I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
198	Chandler	 What?
199	Ben	 Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
200	Chandler	 You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!
201	Monica	 Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
202		[They walk to the kitchen; everyone is lowering their voices]
203	Ross	 (to Chandler) What are you doing?
204	Chandler	 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
205	Ross	 Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
206	Chandler	 Why?
207	Ross	 Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.
208	Chandler	 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
209	Ross	 I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
210	Chandler	 Fine, I'll give the suit back.
211		[Ross turns around and walks back to Ben.]
212	Monica	 (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
213	Chandler	 Santa? Really?
214	Monica	 Yes, is that okay?
215	Chandler	 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
216	Monica	 No.
217	Chandler	 Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
218	Ross	 Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
219	Ben	 No! Why does he have to go?
220	Chandler	 Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
221	Ben	 No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
222	Ross	 Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
223	Chandler	 Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
224	Ben	 Okay, Santa!
225		(Ross mouths to Chandler, "Thank you," and he mouths, "You’re welcome," back.)
226	Ross	 All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
227		[Joey enters in a Superman-costume]
228	Joey	 (entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!
229	[Scene	 Phoebe and Rachel's, they are entering to check out the newly refurbished apartment.]
230	Rachel	 Oh wow! Look at this place!
231	Phoebe	 Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
232	Rachel	 (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
233	Phoebe	 What?
234	Rachel	 (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
235	Phoebe	 Yeah?
236	Rachel	 And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
237	Phoebe	 Yeah?
238	Rachel	 Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods, "No.") It left! It’s one huge room!
239	Phoebe	 Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
240	Rachel	 See?
241	Phoebe	 Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
242	Rachel	 You can’t, because of the new skylight!
243	Phoebe	 There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!!
244	Rachel	 So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
245	Phoebe	 (returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
246	Rachel	 Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
247	Phoebe	 A little bit, yeah.
248	Rachel	 Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
249	Phoebe	 You heard her too?! You have the gift!
250	Rachel	 Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.
251	Phoebe	 Are you sure?
252	Rachel	 Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.
253	Phoebe	 Oh me too.
254	Rachel	 I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
255	Phoebe	 No, I do not hear that.
256	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Santa (Chandler), Superman (Joey), Ben, and Monica are listening to the Holiday Armadillo (Ross) finish telling the story of Hanukkah.]
257	Ross	 …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…
258	Ben	 (answering him) Eight whole days.
259	Ross	 That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
260	Ben	 Awesome!
261	Ross	 Yeah?
262	Chandler	 My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)
263	Ross	 The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
264	Rachel	 (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
265	Phoebe	 Oh.
266	Rachel	 (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
267	Ross	 Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
268	Rachel	 Oh.
269	Phoebe	 Oh.
270		(They both go over to light the candles.)
271	Phoebe	 Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
272		Ending Credits
273	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is closing the door on the tarantula cage.]
274	Rachel	 I got it!
275	Joey	 (yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?
276	Rachel	 Its back in cage!
277	Joey	 Cage closed?
278	Rachel	 Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
279		(Joey throws open his door and stands there still in the Superman costume then slowly makes his way to the bathroom while keeping both eyes on the cage.)
280		End
