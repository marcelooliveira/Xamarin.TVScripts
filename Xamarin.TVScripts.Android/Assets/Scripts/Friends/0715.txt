2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are sitting around the table.]
3	Monica	 I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
4	Rachel	 (starting to cry) Ohh…
5	Ross	 What’s the matter? You okay?
6	Rachel	 Yeah, it’s just y’know…
7	Chandler	 (To Ross) Monica said wedding.
8	Monica	 Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
9	Rachel	 Oh! I would love to read a poem.
10	Chandler	 Do you think you could get through a poem?
11	Rachel	 (crying) It’ll be a short one.
12	Monica	 Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
13	Rachel	 Ohhh…
14	Ross	 Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
15	Chandler	 Too?
16	Ross	 Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
17	Monica	 Do you mind telling us what it is?
18	Ross	 Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
19	Chandler	 Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)
20	Joey	 (entering, excited) Hey!
21	All	 Hey!
22	Joey	 So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…
23	Monica	 What is DOOL?
24	Joey	 Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
25	All	 Oh!!
26	Chandler	 That’s great!
27	Joey	 And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!
28	Chandler	 So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
29	Rachel	 Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
30	Joey	 Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
31	Ross	 What? A brain transplant?!
32	Joey	 (seriously) Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.
33	Ross	 It’s ridiculous!
34	Joey	 Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months.
35	Ross	 (to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
36	Monica	 Who are they killing off?
37	Joey	 Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
38	Rachel and Monica	 Noo!!
39	Monica	 She’s my favorite character on DOOL.
40	Joey	 Nice.
41	Rachel	 She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.
42	Monica	 And the way she slaps all the time!
43	Rachel	 Oh!
44	Monica	 Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)
45	Chandler	 Don’t do it.
46	Rachel	 Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
47	Joey	 Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
48	Ross	 Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
49	Joey	 Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
50		Opening Credits
51	[Scene	 Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch in Central Perk]
52	Phoebe	 (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
53	Rachel	 (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.
54	Phoebe	 Yeah? Why?
55	Rachel	 Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
56	Phoebe	 Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
57	Rachel	 Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
58	Phoebe	 (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
59	Rachel	 All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
60	Phoebe	 Ohh, he left his cell phone.
61	Rachel	 Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
62	Phoebe	 Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
63	Rachel	 What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
64	Phoebe	 Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both get up.)
65	Rachel	 What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
66	Phoebe	 I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
67	Rachel	 Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
68	Phoebe	 That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having sex.
69	Rachel	 Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
70	Phoebe	 No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
71	Rachel	 Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.
72	Phoebe	 Nice try.
73	Rachel	 Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
74	Phoebe	 I don’t know.
75		(They edge closer to the phone on the table.)
76	Rachel	 Well umm, maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!
77		(She holds the phone out and starts taunting Phoebe. Phoebe calming knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand and catches it.)
78	Phoebe	 Ah-ha! Too cocky!
79	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, Joey is watching Jessica Lockhart perform a scene.]
80	Dina	 I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!
81	Jessica Lockhart	 Oh yes there is!
82	Dina	 What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
83	Jessica Lockhart	 (gasps) That was an accident! And so were you.
84	Dina	 Well, at least I’m not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)
85	Jessica Lockhart	 (crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dina’s head to her other shoulder so that she’s the only one in the picture.)
86	The Director	 Cut!
87		(Joey walks up to Cecilia Monroe who plays Jessica.)
88	Joey	 That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
89	Cecilia	 Oh, just years of experience.
90	Dina	 (crying) Can I get some ice here?!
91	Joey	 Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
92	Cecilia	 You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?
93	Joey	 Say what?
94	Cecilia	 I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but that’s not supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!
95	Joey	 No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!
96	Cecilia	 Oh that was a real person?!
97	Joey	 An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…
98	Cecilia	 I-I-I’m leaving the show?
99	Joey	 (quickly) I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?
100	Cecilia	 Who told you that?
101	Joey	 Oh uh, one of the writers.
102	Cecilia	 Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
103	Joey	 Umm…
104	Cecilia	 Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!
105	Joey	 Okay.
106	Cecilia	 And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I’ve been playing for 20 years—I’ll give you a tip! (She throws her drink in his face.)
107	Joey	 Ms. Monroe… (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)
108	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still arguing over the phone.]
109	Rachel	 No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
110	Phoebe	 Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
111	Rachel	 I don’t think so.
112	Phoebe	 (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
113	Rachel	 (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
114	Phoebe	 Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
115	Rachel	 Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
116	Phoebe	 Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
117	Rachel	 Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!
118	Phoebe	 Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.
119	Rachel	 (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.
120	Phoebe	 So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?
121	Rachel	 (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
122	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are eating lunch, when they start to hear a horrible screeching noise. It sounds like someone is skinning a cat.]
123	Monica	 What is that?
124	Chandler	 I think it’s the dying cat parade.
125	Monica	 It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.
126	Chandler	 (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
127	Monica	 What?
128	Chandler	 Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half Scottish right?"
129	Monica	 Nooo!!
130	Chandler	 Yes!!
131		[Cut to Ross’s apartment, he is playing the Bagpipes, badly. He’s worse than that whole keyboard thing a few years ago.]
132		Commercial Break
133	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier. They both get up and move to the window.]
134	Monica	 No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
135	Chandler	 Why is your family Ross?!
136	Monica	 He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!
137	Chandler	 If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
138	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is putting out some Sunflower seeds as Rachel enters.]
139	Rachel	 Hi Pheebs!
140	Phoebe	 Hi!
141	Rachel	 How are ya?
142	Phoebe	 Good.
143	Rachel	 Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?
144	Phoebe	 Yeah.
145	Rachel	 And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
146	Phoebe	 Yeah!
147	Rachel	 And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
148	Phoebe	 Ooh, now you lost me.
149	Rachel	 You stole the phone!
150	Phoebe	 No I didn’t!
151	Rachel	 No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?
152	Phoebe	 No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)
153	Rachel	 Phoebe!
154	Phoebe	 That is a different phone.
155	Rachel	 Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please. (To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It’s for me!
156	Phoebe	 That is damning evidence.
157		(The cute guy’s phone rings.)
158	Rachel	 Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand, catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
159	Phoebe	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.
160	Rachel	 Phoebe! You can’t do th…
161	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8
162	Rachel	 You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
163	Phoebe	 Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
164	Rachel	 You just said it!
165	Phoebe	 Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
166	Rachel	 Oh Phoebe!
167	Phoebe	 What?! That’s the first time today!
168	Rachel	 Ohh! (Exits.)
169	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, Dina is at the craft services table getting some food as Joey walks up.]
170	Joey	 So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…
171	Dina	 (interrupting) I’m 16.
172	Joey	 See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
173	Cecilia	 (walking up) You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently it's going to be very soon and that’s it.
174	Joey	 I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
175	Cecilia	 Yeah, thanks.
176	Joey	 No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
177	Cecilia	 Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?
178	Joey	 Joey.
179	Cecilia	 Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her drink on a passing writer.)
180	The Writer	 It wasn’t my decision!
181	Cecilia	 (to him) I’m having a conversation here! (To Joey) You were saying?
182	Joey	 Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
183	Cecilia	 All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
184	Joey	 Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!
185	Cecilia	 You’re so welcome.
186	Joey	 Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (In a British accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again! Ever!!"
187	Cecilia	 Is that supposed to be me?
188	Joey	 Yeah.
189	Cecilia	 Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.
190	Joey	 (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my r�sum�!
191	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch. Ross is sitting on the armchair.]
192	Chandler	 Well, I feel like a snack!
193	Monica	 Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
194	Chandler	 Oh no thanks. I don’t like anything from my Scottish heritage.
195	Ross	 What?!
196	Chandler	 Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
197	Ross	 Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
198	Monica	 No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
199	Ross	 Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
200	Monica	 (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
201	Ross	 How did you know about that?!
202	Chandler	 We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
203	Ross	 Were you the ones called the cops?!
204	Chandler	 That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
205	Ross	 Why not?
206	Chandler	 Because we hate them.
207	Ross	 Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
208	Chandler	 We have heard you play.
209	Ross	 No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a wee bit o’ celebration.
210	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, Joey is getting pointers on how to play Jessica Lockhart.]
211	Cecilia	 So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. (Joey is nodding.) You try.
212	Joey	 Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) All right!
213	Cecilia	 No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
214	Joey	 Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
215	Cecilia	 Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! (Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, it’s a little weird, but it’s getting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do! I mean, it’s been 20 years of my life.
216	Joey	 Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.
217	Cecilia	 I am. I am, but I don’t know, you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
218	Joey	 Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!
219	Cecilia	 I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
220	Joey	 Like-like what?
221	Cecilia	 Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
222	Joey	 (impressed) Wow!
223	Cecilia	 But… Well now, now’s a different time for me. (Starts to cry.)
224	Joey	 Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (She’s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
225	Cecilia	 (intrigued) You think I’m hot?
226	Joey	 You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh…
227	Cecilia	 Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the… (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man’s face. (She does so.)
228	Joey	 Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?
229	Cecilia	 No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her hands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?
230	Joey	 Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
231	Cecilia	 That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands may be a little off, they should be maybe right like… (She grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)
232		Commercial Break
233	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for the cute guy to show up for his cell phone. Rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and moving into it. Phoebe tries to steal some.]
234	Rachel	 Hey! Hey!
235		(There is a knock on the door.)
236	Phoebe and Rachel	 (simultaneously) Who is it?
237	Guy	 Hi! It’s Tom, I’m here to pick up the phone.
238		(Rachel excitedly jumps up and heads for the door.)
239	Phoebe	 Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
240	Rachel	 Well why shouldn’t I?!
241	Phoebe	 Because it’s my apartment!
242	Rachel	 Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
243	Phoebe	 Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
244		(Phoebe opens the door and Tom, an older gentleman with white hair, enters.)
245	Tom	 Hi!
246	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
247	Rachel	 (laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.
248	Tom	 No that’s my assistant.
249	Rachel	 Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
250	Tom	 Umm, no.
251	Phoebe	 Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
252	Tom	 Sure!
253	Rachel	 We’ll be right back sir.
254	Tom	 Sure.
255		(They walk into the living room.)
256	Phoebe	 Wh-what do we do?
257	Rachel	 I don’t know!
258	Phoebe	 Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
259	Rachel	 I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
260	Phoebe	 Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
261	Rachel	 (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
262	Phoebe	 Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
263	Rachel	 (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
264	Phoebe	 Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
265	Rachel	 Ohh…
266	Tom	 So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
267	Phoebe	 Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
268	Tom	 Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
269	Phoebe	 (whispering) Nice!
270	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Cecilia is entering the living room from Joey’s room followed by Joey.]
271	Cecilia	 Well, you certainly own that room.
272	Joey	 Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
273		(She laughs as Rachel enters.)
274	Rachel	 Hi.
275	Joey	 Hey!
276		(Rachel stops dead in her tracks when she sees whom Joey is with.)
277	Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
278	Cecilia	 Well, it’s nice to know that you…
279	Rachel	 (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica’s.)
280	Joey	 That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
281	Cecilia	 Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.
282	Joey	 (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
283	Monica	 (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
284	Cecilia	 Certainly.
285	Monica	 Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.)
286	Cecilia	 I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.
287	Rachel	 God. You seem really, really nice.
288	Joey	 Okay, bye-bye.
289	Rachel	 I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
290	Joey	 All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)
291	Rachel	 Okay.
292	Monica	 (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia) Umm, you’re a stupid bitch.
293	Cecilia	 I really can’t slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)
294	Rachel	 You are so beautiful.
295	Monica	 Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!
296	Joey	 Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I…
297	Cecilia	 Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry about it.
298	Joey	 (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
299	Cecilia	 What?
300	Joey	 They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!
301	Cecilia	 They don’t?
302	Joey	 Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh…
303	Cecilia	 How does it happen?
304	Joey	 (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
305	Cecilia	 Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
306	Joey	 Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.
307	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to hear Ross perform his interpretation of Celebration by Cool and the Gang on the bag pipe.]
308	Ross	 …now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
309	Rachel	 (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
310	Ross	 (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
311	Rachel	 No!
312	Ross	 (stands up) Now umm, remember I’m still learning.
313		(As he prepares to start, he makes several horrible noises that scares Rachel into retreat.)
314	Ross	 One, two, three, four!
315		(He starts. And well, Celebration was never meant to be played on the bagpipe, so even the best bag pipe players in the world would have trouble with that particular song. So of course, for a beginner like Ross, it sounds absolutely dreadful. The assembled audience minus Phoebe, are horrified. Phoebe, immune to bad music, seems to enjoy it.)
316	Ross	 You know the song! Sing along!
317		(Ross resumes playing, this time accompanied by Phoebe screeching out E’s in tune with Ross. While Phoebe is singing along, Rachel is having a very difficult time keeping a straight face. Thankfully, Ross gives up after a little while.)
318	Ross	 So?
319	Monica and Chandler	 No!
320		(Ross throws the bagpipes down in disgust.)
321	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, a scene is being shot where Dina and Fredrick are celebrating Jessica’s horrible accident by drinking champagne.]
322	Dina	 Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
323	Fredrick	 Thank you sweetheart. (They clink glasses.)
324	Dina	 I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. (They move into a kiss but; they’re stopped by Joey entering with a huge bandage wrapped around his head.)
325	Joey	 (as Jessica) I don’t think so.
326	Dina	 Who are you?!
327	Jessica Lockhart	 What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own (Does a hair flip) mother?!
328	The Director	 Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
329	Cecilia	 (running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think that you’re a better Jessica than I ever was!
330	Joey	 Oh noo…
331	Cecilia	 Well of course not, but you were very good.
332	Joey	 Thanks!
333	Cecilia	 And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
334	Joey	 Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!
335	Cecilia	 A film in Guadalajara!
336	Joey	 The airport?
337	Cecilia	 No that’s La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico.
338	Joey	 Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
339	Cecilia	 Eight months.
340	Joey	 That’s a really long time.
341	Cecilia	 Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
342	Joey	 Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
343	Cecilia	 That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You’ve, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
344	Joey	 Good luck.
345	Cecilia	 You too.
346		(They kiss and both put their hands on the other’s face like Jessica would do.)
347		Ending Credits
348	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to hear Ross perform his interpretation of Celebration by Cool and the Gang on the bag pipe. Yes, I typed that earlier. We’re seeing this again, only this time Ross as already started playing.]
349	Ross	 You know the song! Sing along!
350	Phoebe	 Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
351		(Monica (Courtney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) are laughing. That then causes Lisa and Jennifer to come out of character and start laughing hysterically. And that finally causes David Schwimmer to come out of character and start laughing as well. Matthew decides to sing along now as well.)
352	Matthew Perry	 Eee!! (This causes more laughter.)
353	Lisa Kudrow	 Do it again!
354		(Matthew mimics the sound again.)
355		End
356	(Why was this the trailer? Well, that’s because it was an introduction into the special out takes episode that immediately followed the show. The entire out takes episode, Friends	 The Stuff You’ve Never Seen can be read by following this link.)
