3	Phoebe	 Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?
4	Monica	 Yeah.
5	Ross	 Sure. Yeah.
6	Joey	 So, who’s the guy?
7	Phoebe	 Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
8	Chandler	 Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?
9	Phoebe	 Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
10	Monica	 (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
11	Ross	 Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
12	Monica	 Yeah, I’d really like to.
13	Ross	 Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.
14	Monica	 Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.
15	Chandler	 And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
16	Monica	 No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they’ll say this year? "God, you"
17	Joey	 Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to himself) I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
18	Monica	 Really you can do that?
19	Joey	 Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!
20		Opening Credits
21	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica’s, they’re getting ready to leave for the party.]
22	Chandler	 What are you doing?
23	Monica	 Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
24	Chandler	 It’s a dog.
25	Monica	 It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
26	Chandler	 It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?
27	Monica	 The good stuff, huh?
28		(Ross, Joey, and Rachel enter)
29	Rachel	 Hi!
30	Ross	 Hey!
31	Joey	 Hey!
32	Monica	 You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.
33	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
34	Ross	 Aww that is so cool.
35	Joey	 And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
36	Rachel	 Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
37	Chandler	 Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
38	Ross	 (picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
39	Monica	 What?!
40	Ross	 You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
41		(Phoebe and Parker enter)
42	Phoebe	 Hey!
43	All	 Hi!
44	Phoebe	 Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…
45	Parker	 No, no, no wait! Don’t tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I’m sorry Phoebe didn’t mention you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, I’m kidding all ready you’re my favorite!
46	Chandler	 Ha!
47	Parker	 Why don’t all of you tell me a little about your self?
48	Ross	 Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.
49	Parker	 (laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts hand on her stomach)
50	Rachel	 I, uh, think you already are.
51	Parker	 Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than—Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
52	Monica	 That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.
53	Parker	 Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where’s the party?
54	Monica	 It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.
55	Parker	 Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber’s Note
56	Ross	 Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
57	Monica	 Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?
58	Chandler	 Yeah.
59	Monica	 And I’ve got the car keys.
60	Parker	 We’re driving!?
61	Monica	 Yeah.
62	Parker	 Aces!
63		(Everyone except Ross and Rachel leave.)
64	Ross	 So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
65	Rachel	 Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
66	Ross	 Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
67	Rachel	 Yeah, otherwise I’m not going.
68	[Scene	 The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel are arriving and see his parents.]
69	Mr. and Mrs. Geller	 Hi
70	Ross	 Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
71	Rachel	 This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
72	Mrs. Geller	 Jack?
73	Mr. Geller	 Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? (Looking a toothpick)
74	Ross	 That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…
75	Rachel	 Hmmm….
76	Woman	 (To Ross and Rachel) Congratulations you two!
77	Rachel	 Thank you…we’re so excited
78	Woman	 And also, congratulations on your wedding.
79	Ross	 Wha—What?
80	Mrs. Geller	 Can we talk to you for just a y’know… It’s just a little thing. Well we think it’s absolutely marvelous that you’re having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we’ve told them all that you’re married.
81	Ross and Rachel	 What?!
82	Mrs. Geller	 Thanks for going along with this.
83	Ross	 Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
84	Mr. Geller	 Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
85	Ross	 Can you believe that?
86	Rachel	 Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
87	Ross	 No, us having to lie about being married.
88	Rachel	 No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.
89	Woman	 Ross!
90	Man	 Rachel!
91	Ross	 Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
92	Aunt Lisa	 Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
93	Ross and Rachel	 Hmmmm….
94	Uncle Dan	 Here’s a little something to get you started. (Hands them a check)
95	Rachel	 Oh…
96	Aunt Lisa	 So, how’s married life treating you?
97	Rachel	 (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
98	Ross	 We love marriage!
99	Aunt Lisa	 Great!
100		(The rest of the gang arrives including Parker.)
101	Ross	 Hey
102	Phoebe	 Hey!
103	Parker	 What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C…I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don’t want to forget this moment! It’s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental picture of them all.)
104	Chandler	 I don’t think the flash went off.
105	Parker	 Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.) I’m going to find the men’s room, be right back.
106	Phoebe	 I’ll go with you
107	Parker	 Come on!
108	Chandler	 Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
109	Joey	 I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.
110	Ross	 I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
111	Monica	 He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
112	Ross	 (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
113	Phoebe	 Were you guys making fun of Parker?
114	Ross	 That depends, how much did you hear?
115	Phoebe	 So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?
116	Monica	 It’s just that, it’s so much.
117	Phoebe	 Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)
118	Monica	 I feel terrible.
119	Joey	 I know
120	Ross	 What was wrong with Mona?
121		Commercial Break
122	[Scene	 The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel have just gotten another wedding present.]
123	Rachel	 Open it! Open it! Open it!
124	Ross	 Yeah baby!
125	Man	 So we never got to hear about your wedding!
126	Woman	 We were surprise that we weren’t invited.
127	Ross	 No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
128	Rachel	 But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
129	Man	 Where did you have it?
130	Rachel	 On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
131	Woman	 Really?
132	Rachel	 Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)
133	Woman	 Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
134	Rachel	 So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
135	Ross	 Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm…. what are you doing?
136	Rachel	 What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
137	Ross	 Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
138	Rachel	 Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
139		(Cut to Phoebe and Parker)
140	Parker	 Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
141	Phoebe	 No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.
142	Parker	 And I’m with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to man’s plate dispensing problems.
143	Phoebe	 Hm huh, yeah.
144	Parker	 Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
145	Phoebe	 No, that’s not necessary.
146	Parker	 Please.
147	Phoebe	 No, actually I don’t eat…
148	Parker	 I won’t quit until you try.
149	Phoebe	 Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm….
150	Parker	 What are they like? I’ve never had one.
151	Phoebe	 Why don’t you just try one?
152	Parker	 No, they look too weird.
153		(Cut to Monica and Chandler)
154	Chandler	 What are you doin’?
155	Monica	 Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.
156	Chandler	 Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).
157		(Cut to Rachel and Ross)
158	Rachel	 And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
159	Woman	 Blind?
160	Rachel	 Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
161	Aunt Lisa	 I’ll bet you looked beautiful…
162	Rachel	 Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
163	Woman	 (To Ross) So, how did you propose?
164	Rachel	 Oh yeah. That’s a great story.
165	Ross	 Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…
166	Aunt Lisa	 Oh that is so sweet!
167	Rachel	 Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
168	Ross	 Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
169		(Various oohs and ahhs)
170	Rachel	 And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
171		(Cut to Phoebe and Joey)
172	Joey	 Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.
173	Phoebe	 Then you better do it now.
174	Joey	 Why?
175	Phoebe	 Because I’m going to kill him
176	Joey	 What-what?
177	Phoebe	 You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.
178	Joey	 I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
179	Phoebe	 Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?
180	Joey	 I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.
181	Phoebe	 He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.
182	Joey	 Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.
183	Phoebe	 You think?
184	Joey	 Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
185	Phoebe	 You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.
186	Joey	 Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
187	Phoebe	 What’s that now?
188	Joey	 Nothing…
189	Phoebe	 Oh look it’s Parker!
190	Parker	 Look! It’s the bunny hop!
191	Phoebe	 Oooh I love it!
192	Parker	 You do?!
193	Phoebe	 Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
194		(Cut to Monica, at the microphone)
195	Monica	 Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.
196		(Everyone sighs)
197	Monica	 No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesn’t get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!
198	Mrs. Geller	 Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn’t it interesting, Jack?
199	Mr. Geller	 (looking at the picture) Why don’t I remember this dog?
200	Mrs. Geller	 Ross, why don’t you give us your toast now?
201	Ross	 Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.
202	Mrs. Geller	 You’re not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary
203	Ross	 No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
204	Mrs. Geller	 (crying) Oh Ross…
205	Mr. Geller	 I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross’s toast.
206	[Scene	 Phoebe’s apartment, Parker and her are entering.]
207	Parker	 My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
208	Phoebe	 Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
209	Parker	 I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…
210	Phoebe	 Oh thank God.
211	Parker	 It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst…
212	Phoebe	 Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
213	Parker	 That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch I’ve ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)
214	Phoebe	 Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.
215	Parker	 I love games!
216	Phoebe	 Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (Giggles)
217	Parker	 Or…Jenga.
218	Phoebe	 But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
219		(They sit back)
220	Parker	 I lose, now Jenga.
221	Phoebe	 Oh my God! Oh my God!
222	Parker	 Is something wrong?
223	Phoebe	 Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
224	Parker	 Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
225	Phoebe	 You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
226	Parker	 I’m sorry that’s who I am. I’m a positive person.
227	Phoebe	 No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
228	Parker	 So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
229	Phoebe	 Much less happy!
230	Parker	 Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I’d better be going."
231	Phoebe	 So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
232		(There’s a knock on door, and Phoebe opens it.)
233	Parker	 Isn’t this the most incredible fight you’ve ever had in your entire life?
234	Phoebe	 Uh huh. (Closes door)
235	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel’s, they’re returning from the party.]
236	Ross	 …and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
237	Rachel	 Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.
238	Ross	 But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?
239	Rachel	 It was really fun being married to you tonight.
240	Ross	 Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.
241	Rachel	 Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
242	Ross	 Yeah.
243	Rachel	 That proposal, at the planetarium…
244	Ross	 I know, I know it was stupid.
245	Rachel	 Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
246	Ross	 No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
247	Rachel	 Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.
248	Ross	 It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
249	Rachel	 Goodnight
250		(They go off to their bedrooms)
251	Ross	 Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?
252	Rachel	 I will think about it.
253	Ross	 That’s all I’m askin’
254		Ending Credits
255	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Monica are there.]
256	Monica	 Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.
257	Ross	 Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
258	Monica	 Oh, come on.
259	Ross	 Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
260	Monica	 (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
261		End
