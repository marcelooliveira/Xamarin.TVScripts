2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Frank and Alice are there talking with Phoebe.]
3	Phoebe	 Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!
4	Frank	 Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)
5	Phoebe	 You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?
6	Frank	 ‘Cause it just sorta happened, y’know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…
7	Phoebe	 Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
8	Frank	 We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married!
9	Phoebe	 Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay. Stop it, don’t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
10	Frank	 Uhh, yeah.
11	Alice	 We’ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we’d get a jump on things, y’know no one’s getting any younger.
12	Frank	 See the thing is umm, we’re not able to y’know, uh, conceive.
13	Alice	 And we’ve tried everything, we’ve seen a bunch of doctors.
14	Frank	 Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
15	Phoebe	 (shocked) That’s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
16		Opening Credits
17	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are trying to throw cards into a vase.]
18	Joey	 (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He’s wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.
19	Chandler	 I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
20		(The gang is stunned.)
21	Ross	 What?
22	Chandler	 Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
23	Rachel	 But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
24	Chandler	 Well, you-you know what I meant.
25	Monica	 No, you messed it up. You’re stupid.
26	Chandler	 So what job did you get Joe?
27	Joey	 Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
28	Rachel	 Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
29	Joey	 No, not really. They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
30	Chandler, Monica, and Rachel	 Great!! That’s great!
31	Ross	 Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period.
32	Joey	 Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
33	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!!
34	All	 Hey!
35	Phoebe	 Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
36	All	 Oh my God!!
37	Phoebe	 And! And, they’re gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)
38	Ross	 My God!
39	Monica	 Are you serious?
40	Phoebe	 Yeah
41	Joey	 You’re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
42	Phoebe	 Ewww! And "Oh no!" It’s—they just want me to be the surrogate. It’s her-it’s her egg and her sperm, and I’m-I’m just the oven, it’s totally their bun.
43	Joey	 Huh.
44	Monica	 What did you tell them?
45	Phoebe	 Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I’m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
46	Chandler	 You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
47	Rachel	 Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
48	Monica	 Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
49	Phoebe	 I know!
50	Ross	 Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!
51	Phoebe	 Yeah, what’s your point?
52	Ross	 Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
53	Rachel	 Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper.
54	Phoebe	 Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
55	Joey	 No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy.
56	All	 Yeah.
57	Monica	 We just want you to think it through.
58	Rachel	 Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?
59	Phoebe	 My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
60	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are kissing.]
61	Kathy	 Umm, (moves her hand’s down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
62	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
63	Kathy	 Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)
64	Monica	 I am so jealous.
65	Rachel	 You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
66	Chandler	 Yes. Right where?
67	Monica	 In the beginning where y’know it’s all sex and talking and sex and talking and…
68	Chandler	 Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
69	Monica	 And the sex?
70	Chandler	 All right, we haven’t had sex yet. Okay, what’s the big deal? Y’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
71	Rachel	 Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
72	Ross	 That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!
73	Rachel	 Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something like that?!
74	Chandler	 No, he’s right, I’m totally lying.
75		(Ross makes an "I was right, and you weren’t face." And Rachel does Ross’s little I’m-flicking-you-off-but-I’m-not-giving-you-the-finger banging of the fists.)
76	Monica	 Then what is it?
77	Chandler	 Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey.
78	Ross	 And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.
79	Chandler	 No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.
80	Ross	 Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
81	Chandler	 Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
82	Monica	 So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.
83	Chandler	 We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
84	Monica	 Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love.
85	Chandler	 Yeah?
86	Rachel	 Yeah!
87	Ross	 Just go for it Chandler.
88	Monica	 Yeah, you should.
89	Rachel	 Yeah, you should, really.
90	Monica	 Go on.
91	Chandler	 All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.
92	[Scene	 The museum, Joey is giving a tour to a bunch of school kids.]
93	Joey	 Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
94	Smart Kid	 Isn’t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
95	Joey	 Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave ‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your mouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on.
96	[Scene	 Phoebe Sr.’s house, there’s a knock on the door.]
97	Phoebe Sr	 It’s open! Come in!
98	Phoebe	 Hi!
99	Phoebe Sr	 Hi!
100	Phoebe	 I’m sorry, I’m late.
101	Phoebe Sr	 Oh, that’s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
102	Phoebe	 Wow! You really go all out when you’re expecting company.
103	Phoebe Sr	 No, I was working on my pottery.
104	Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn’t know that you did…pot.
105	Phoebe Sr	 Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
106	Phoebe	 Ooh, erotiery!
107	Phoebe Sr	 Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y’know…
108	Phoebe	 Okay.
109	Phoebe Sr	 I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe.
110	Phoebe	 Why not?
111	Phoebe Sr	 Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I really don’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the couch.)
112	Phoebe	 Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don’t-don’t hurt the puppy.
113	Phoebe Sr	 No-no-no, the-the puppy’s yours.
114	Phoebe	 Oh, I get a puppy!!
115	Phoebe Sr	 Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
116	Phoebe	 Why?
117	Phoebe Sr	 I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn’t paying attention and is busy mimicking the puppy.) uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it’s very important.
118	Phoebe	 Okay.
119	Phoebe Sr	 I mean, I know what I’m talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy again, and not listening) I really shouldn’t have given you the puppy first.
120	Phoebe	 All right, I’m sorry.
121	[Scene	 The museum’s worker cafeteria, Joey is eating lunch with the rest of the tour guides. Another tour guide tries to sit down in a seat Joey saved for Ross.]
122	Joey	 Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross.
123	Tour Guide	 You mean Dr. Geller?
124	Joey	 Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname.
125	Tour Guide	 Oh, he won’t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
126	Joey	 Well, how-how come?
127	Tour Guide	 That’s just the way it is.
128	Joey	 That’s crazy.
129	Tour Guide	 Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now…(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! It’s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin’ which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! (to Joey) See, he pretend he don’t even here me!
130	Joey	 I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you. Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he will sit in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
131	Ross	 That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
132		(Another woman enters without a coat or blazer and tries to sit at the ‘blue’ table.)
133	Tour Guide	 Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop.
134		Commercial Break
135	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating dinner, Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
136	Ross	 (entering) Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
137	Joey	 It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
138	Ross	 But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
139	Joey	 Whatever.
140	Ross	 It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
141	Monica	 I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
142	Joey	 Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it. Y’know, hey I understand. Y’know? Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)
143	Rachel	 Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave.
144	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe is there with her puppy and is trying to sing it to sleep as Chandler enters.]
145	Chandler	 Hi.
146	Monica	 Hey!
147	Chandler	 Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
148	Phoebe	 Ooh, y’know what, I think it’s time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let’s go to the balcony.
149	Monica	 What?!
150	Phoebe	 Umm, the street. Come on, let’s go to the street. Ooh, listen, don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)
151	Monica	 (to Chandler) So, did you do it?
152	Chandler	 Yes, yes, we had the sex.
153	Monica	 Uh-oh, it was bad?
154	Chandler	 It was fine, y’know? But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I’m all right with it."
155	Monica	 Well, it was the first time. Y’know, there’s not always a lot of agreement the first time.
156	Rachel	 Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
157	Chandler	 Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody’s killing her in there!"
158	Monica	 All right, I’m gonna show you something a lot of guys don’t know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All right. Now…
159	Chandler	 Look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’s hot!
160	Monica	 Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than three), five, six, and seven!
161	Chandler	 (shocked) There are seven?!
162	Rachel	 Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.
163	Chandler	 (Points to one) That’s one?
164	Monica	 It’s kind of an important one!
165	Chandler	 Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
166	Rachel	 Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)
167	Monica	 (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
168	Chandler	 That-that’s bad?
169	Rachel	 Well if you go to Disneyland, you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
170	Chandler	 Well you might if it were anything like 7!
171	Monica	 All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit ‘em all, and you mix ‘em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
172	Rachel	 Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
173	Monica	 All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
174	[Scene	 The museum cafeteria, Joey is eating with the tour guides as Ross enters.]
175	Older Scientist	 Dr. Geller, there’s a seat over here. (Motions to an empty chair at the ‘white’ table.)
176	Ross	 Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me.
177	Joey	 (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table and they shake hands.)
178	Ross	 Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat and throws it down.) I’m Ross! I’m divorced, and I have a kid!
179	Joey	 (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I’m Joey! I’m an actor! I don’t know squat about dinosaurs!
180	Another Tour Guide	 (standing up and removing his coat) I’m Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
181	Ross	 All right, there you go!
182	Joey	 Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
183	Older Scientist	 I’m Andrew, and I didn’t pay for this pear.
184	Ross	 Okay, good-good for you.
185	Tour Guide	 I’m Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these aren’t real! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)
186	Ross	 Wow, Rhonda.
187	Another Scientist	 I’m Scott.
188	Ross	 Yeah, okay, Scott!
189	Another Scientist	 And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
190	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe, with the puppy, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
191	Phoebe	 My mom’s gonna be here any minute. I can’t do this, I can’t give him up. Yes—no, I can. I don’t want to. But I can. No.
192	Rachel	 Oo, I can’t watch this, it’s like Sophie’s Choice.
193	Monica	 Y’know, I never saw that.
194	Rachel	 Ooh, it was only okay.
195	Phoebe	 Ooh, I can’t do this. My mom was right. If I can’t-if I can’t give him up, then there’s no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give ‘em—a kidney!
196	Alice	 (entering with Frank) Hi!
197	Frank	 Hi!
198	Alice	 Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so…
199	Frank	 Yeah, so we just thought we’d stop by and let you know there’s still no pressure.
200	Alice	 None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we’re just gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee.
201	Phoebe	 Okay.
202	Frank	 (noticing the puppy) Oh, who’s this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)
203	Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Umm!
204	Frank	 Oh, he’s so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
205	Alice	 You are so precious, I could just take you home.
206	Phoebe	 Hey, why don’t you?
207	Frank	 Are you serious?
208	Phoebe	 Uh-huh, yeah!
209	Frank	 Oh, thanks.
210	Monica	 What are you doing?
211	Phoebe	 No, I’m really okay with this. Y’know why? ‘Cause look at them, and I made that, so… I know it’s gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it’s gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.
212	Alice	 (shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don’t know what this means to us! Oh!
213	Frank	 Oh my God, I think I’m gonna cry!
214	Monica	 It’s gonna be so great.
215	Phoebe Sr	 (entering) Hi! What’s going on?
216	Phoebe	 Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I’m gonna carry their baby.
217	Phoebe Sr	 But Phoebe…
218	Phoebe	 No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
219	Phoebe Sr	 Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it’s just—that was my puppy.
220	Phoebe	 Oh!
221		Closing Credits
222	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are sitting at the table.]
223	Monica	 Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
224	Rachel	 It depends on who asked.
225	Monica	 What if I asked?
226	Rachel	 Oh, Mon, sure.
227	Monica	 Really?
228	Rachel	 Yes. (Pause) You’re not asking are you?
229	Monica	 No.
230	Rachel	 Yes! Totally!

232	Kathy	 Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! (Runs back to Chandler)
