3	Monica	 Alright. Phoebe?
4	Phoebe	 Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
5	Ross	 Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
6	Chandler	 Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
7	Rachel	 See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.)
8	All	 Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
9	Monica	 Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
10	Joey	 Probably kill myself!
11	Monica	 ..Excuse me?
12	Joey	 Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
13	Ross	 Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
14	Joey	 You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
15		Opening Credits
16	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Monica are watching Phoebe sleep.]
17	Monica	 How does she do that?
18	Ross	 I cannot sleep in a public place.
19	Monica	 Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
20	Phoebe	 (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
21	Ross	 It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
22	Monica	 What's going on with you?
23	Phoebe	 I got no sleep last night!
24	Ross	 Why?
25	Phoebe	 My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
26	Monica	 Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
27	Phoebe	 Thanks.
28		(Chandler and Joey enter. Joey is counting his steps.)
29	Joey	 ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
30	Chandler	 You got waaaay too much free time.
31	Joey	 (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out
32	Chandler	 Happy birthday, pal!
33	Joey	 We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)
34	Ross	 Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
35	Joey	 So?
36	Ross	 So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
37	Chandler	 Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
38	Ross	 Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
39	Monica	 Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
40	Ross	 Ohhh.
41	Joey	 What's wrong with the twentieth?
42	Chandler	 Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
43	Ross	 Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
44	Joey	 The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
45	Chandler	 (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
46	Ross	 What are you doing?
47	Chandler	 (stops) I have no idea.
48	Joey	 C'mon, Ross!
49	Ross	 Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
50	Chandler	 You got it.
51		(Rachel runs up cluching an envelope.)
52	Rachel	 Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
53	Phoebe	 I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
54	Monica	 Wow, you worked in a mine?
55	Phoebe	 I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
56	Rachel	 God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
57	Chandler	 (looking) Oh, this is not that bad.
58	Joey	 Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
59	Ross	 You can totally, totally live on this.
60	Monica	 Yeah, yeah.
61	Ross	 Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
62	All	 Oh! Yeah!
63		(They all get their wallets out and give generous tips.)
64	Guys	 Hockey! (They go to leave but are blocked by three of Rachel's friends, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne. The guys pause to stare at them.) Hockey! Hockey. (The guys.)
65	Leslie	 (looking around) Rachel?
66	Rachel	 Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.
67	Monica	 (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
68	Rachel	 What are you guys doing here?
69	Kiki	 Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
70	Joanne	 Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
71	Rachel	 (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
72	Leslie	 I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
73	Rachel	 (to Joanne) So what's going on with you?
74	Joanne	 Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.)
75	Kiki	 And while we're on the subject of news.. (She holds up here finger to show off her engagement ring and they all scream again.)
76	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)
77	[Scene	 A Street, Chandler and Joey are kicking a can to each other.]
78	Chandler	 ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
79	Joey	 Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)
80	Chandler	 We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
81	Ross	 Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry.
82		(They walk on. Chandler and Joey start to talk but Ross stops and whines.)
83	Joey	 What?
84	Ross	 Peach pit.
85	Chandler	 Yes, Bunny?
86	Ross	 (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
87	Joey	 -Peaches?
88	Ross	 Actually, nectarines, but basically...
89	Chandler	 (to Joey) Could've been a peach.
90	Ross	 Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
91	Joey	 Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
92	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel, Lesile, Kiki, and Joanne are talking.]
93	Rachel	 So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
94	Kiki	 Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
95	Joanne	 Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
96	Rachel	 Okay.
97	Joanne	 When are you coming home?
98	Rachel	 What? Guys, I'm not.
99	Joanne	 C'mon, this is us.
100	Rachel	 I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
101	Kiki	 Waitressing?
102	Rachel	 Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
103	Leslie	 Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
104	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are in pajamas and Monica is making something in the blender as Rachel enters.]
105	Monica	 Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
106	Rachel	 What's that?
107	Monica	 Weeeell, it's rum, and-
108	Rachel	 Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink.)
109	Monica	 We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
110	Phoebe	 Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
111	Monica	 Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
112	Rachel	 Oh, God, ask them what they want.
113	Monica	 (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
114	Rachel	 But I haven't used my card in weeks!
115	Monica	 That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
116	Rachel	 They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
117	Monica	 (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
118	Rachel	 Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!
119	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden, the guys are trying to find their seats.]
120	Ross	 (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
121	Chandler	 What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
122	Ross	 No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
123	Joey	 C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
124	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, they're all hanging out in the living room.]
125	Monica	 You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
126	Rachel	 Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
127	Phoebe	 You are just like Jack.
128	Rachel	 ...Jack from downstairs?
129	Phoebe	 No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
130	Monica	 Ah, the other Jack.
131	Phoebe	 Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
132	Rachel	 Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
133	Phoebe	 Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
134	Rachel	 But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
135	Phoebe	 Floopy?
136	Rachel	 Yeah.
137	Monica	 So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
138	Phoebe	 Oh, like that's a word.
139	Rachel	 Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
140	Monica	 ...Pheebs?
141	Phoebe	 Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
142	Rachel	 Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
143	[Scene	 Madison Square Garden, the guys are watching the game.]
144	Ross	 Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
145	Chandler	 (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
146	Ross	 Pass it! Pass it!
147	Chandler	 He's open!
148	All	 Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
149		(The player shoots and the puck flies off the rink and hits Ross in the face. Chandler looks concered until he notices...)
150	Chandler	 Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
151		(Chandler and Joey hold the puck and wave at the TV thing.)
152		Commercial Break
153	[Scene	 An Emergency Room, Chandler and Joey are leading Ross in.]
154	Chandler	 (to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
155	Receptionist	 (holds up her hand—she is on the phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
156	Chandler	 Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
157	Receptionist	 (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.)
158	Ross	 (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
159	Receptionist	 Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
160	Joey	 Well, how long do you think it'll be?
161	Receptionist	 (sarcastic) Any minute now.
162	Ross	 Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy...
163	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the slumber party continues.]
164	Rachel	 I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
165	Monica	 No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)
166	Pizza Guy	 (yelling from outside) Pizza guy!
167	Rachel	 Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the door.)
168	Monica	 Phoebe?
169	Phoebe	 What?
170	Monica	 Do you have a plan?
171	Phoebe	 I don't even have a 'pl'.
172	Pizza Guy	 Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
173	Rachel	 (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
174	Pizza Guy	 Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
175	Monica	 (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
176	Pizza Guy	 Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
177	Monica	 Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
178	Pizza Guy	 Yeah, that sounds about right.
179	Monica	 Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
180	Phoebe	 And-and a power tie?
181	Pizza Guy	 No, pretty much just a towel.
182	Monica	 (staggered) Oh God.
183	Pizza Guy	 So you guys want me to take this back?
184	Monica	 Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
185	Rachel	 Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
186	Phoebe	 Big Bird's friend.
187	Monica	 I see pizza!
188	Phoebe	 Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars.)
189	Rachel	 Hello? Who are we spying on?
190	Monica	 White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
191	Rachel	 Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
192	Phoebe	 Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
193	Monica	 Please tell me it's his mother.
194	Phoebe	 Definitely not his mother.
195	Monica	 Oh, no...
196	Phoebe	 Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
197	[Scene	 The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks kitting foreheads. Chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist again.]
198	Chandler	 Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
199	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all out on the balcony.]
200	Monica	 Light still out?
201	Rachel	 Yeah.
202	Monica	 Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
203	Rachel	 Oh please, they're having sex.
204	Monica and Phoebe	 Shut up!
205	Rachel	 So, whaddya think George is like?
206	Monica	 I think he's shy.
207	Phoebe	 Yeah?
208	Monica	 Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
209	[Scene	 The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol.]
210	Ross	 I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
211	Chandler	 Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
212	Joey	 He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
213	Ross	 Look, it's just a little more complicated...
214	Chandler	 Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
215	Ross	 Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
216	Chandler	 Then what?
217	Ross	 My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)
218	Joey	 What?
219	Ross	 It was my first time.
220	Joey	 With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.
221	Chandler	 So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.
222	Joey	 Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
223	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the balcony.]
224	Monica	 Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
225	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
226	Monica	 Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
227	Phoebe	 Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
228	Monica	 What?! You slept with Jason?
229	Phoebe	 You'd already broken up.
230	Rachel	 How long?
231	Phoebe	 A couple hours.
232	Monica	 Oh, that's nice!
233	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
234	Monica	 Excuse me?!
235	Rachel	 Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl.
236	Monica	 Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
237	Rachel	 I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble)
238	Phoebe	 There he is! There he is!
239	Monica	 Where?
240	Phoebe	 Right- where we've been looking all night!
241	Rachel	 He is so cute!
242	Monica	 Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
243	All	 Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the—(pause)—wowww.
244	[Scene	 The Emergency Room, Ross is absent.]
245	Joey	 Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
246	Chandler	 I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
247	Joey	 Really?
248	Chandler	 No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
249	Both	 Hey, buddy.
250	Ross	 Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose. He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
251	Receptionist	 (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.
252	Chandler	 Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
253	Ross	 Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
254	Joey	 Oh, ah- the kid has it.
255	Ross	 The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
256	Kid	 I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)
257	Chandler	 You gotta do it, man.
258	Ross	 (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
259	Kid	 No.
260	Ross	 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
261	Kid	 No! No! (They start to fight over it.)
262	Receptionist	 Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
263	Ross	 (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
264	Ross	 ...Now that was fun.
265		Closing Credits
266	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing twister.]
267	Ross	 (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica
268	Monica	 Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
269		(There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and silently hands back the cushion.)
270	Chandler	 Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
271	Ross	 Okay, Pheebs
272		(The phone rings and Chandler answers it.)
273	Chandler	 Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
274	Rachel	 Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
275	Chandler	 Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.
276	Rachel	 Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
277	Ross	 Green. To the green.
278	Rachel	 (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.
