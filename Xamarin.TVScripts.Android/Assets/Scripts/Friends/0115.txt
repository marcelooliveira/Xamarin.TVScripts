2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is serving Joey, Ross, and Monica their drinks.]
3	Rachel	 (to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him.)
4	Joey	 Thank you.
5	Rachel	 (to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.)
6	Ross	 Grazie.
7	Rachel	 And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)
8	Monica	 Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
9	Rachel	 Yeah?
10	Monica	 Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
11	Rachel	 Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I'm sorry!
12		(She takes the pencil out of Monica's coffee and Monica puts her cup down in disgust.)
13	[Scene	 Chandler's job, Chandler is typing data into his computer, he keeps typing even while taking a drink of coffee with one hand. One of his co-workers walks by.]
14	Woman	 Chandler.
15	Chandler	 Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
16	Mrs. Tedlock	 Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
17	Chandler	 Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
18	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly.]
19	Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
20		(Chandler comes in.)
21	Chandler	 Hey!
22	All	 Hey!
23	Phoebe	 Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
24	Ross	 What's going on?
25	All	 What is it?
26	Chandler	 So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
27	All	 That's great!
28	Chandler	 So.... I quit.
29	All	 Why?
30	Chandler	 Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
31	Monica	 Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
32	Chandler	 If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
33	Phoebe	 So was it a lot more money?
34	Chandler	 It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
35		(Everyone looks at him, confused.)
36	Rachel	 ... the WENUS?
37	Chandler	 Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
38	Rachel	 (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
39	Joey	 So what're you going to do?
40	Chandler	 I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
41	Phoebe	 Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
42	Monica	 (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
43	Phoebe	 Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
44	Chandler	 Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
45	Phoebe	 (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!
46	Monica	 Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
47	Phoebe	 Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
48	Monica	 (excited) Oh my God!
49	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?
50	Chandler	 Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
51	Phoebe	 OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
52	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler walks in, wearing a suit.]
53	Chandler	 Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
54	Rachel	 No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
55	Phoebe	 Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
56	Chandler	 Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."
57	Rachel	 Career counselor?
58	Chandler	 Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
59	Rachel	 I don't!
60	Chandler	 Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
61	Ross	 Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
62		(Monica enters, excited.)
63	Monica	 Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
64	Phoebe	 Ooh! Brian's Song!
65	Rachel	 The meeting with the guy went great?
66	Monica	 So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
67	Chandler	 Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
68	Monica	 So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
69	Rachel	 What are you going to make?
70	Phoebe	 (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
71	Rachel	 (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
72	Monica	 I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
73	Phoebe	 Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)
74	Ross	 Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
75	Joey	 How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
76	Ross	 OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
77	Chandler	 Who are you going out with?
78	Phoebe	 Oh, is this the bug lady?
79	Rachel	 (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
80	Ross	 Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
81	Rachel	 So what are you guys going to do?
82	Ross	 Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
83	Chandler	 And he's not speaking metaphorically.
84	Joey	 (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
85	Ross	 Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.
86	Joey	 I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
87	[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia's hair, and she is screaming, trying to get him off.]
88	Ross	 Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
89	Celia	 I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
90	Ross	 Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
91	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Ross and Chandler. Monica is making food, and having everyone try it.]
92	Monica	 (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
93	Joey	 (tasting) Mmmm. Good.
94	Monica	 Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
95	Joey	 It's creamier.
96	Monica	 Yeah, well, is that better?
97	Joey	 I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
98		(Chandler kicks the door closed, angrily. His clothes are askew, he looks beat.)
99	Rachel	 My God! What happened to you?
100	Chandler	 Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
101	Phoebe	 That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
102	Chandler	 Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
103	Rachel	 (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
104	Monica	 (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
105	Chandler	 Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
106	Monica	 It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
107	Chandler	 (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
108		(Phone rings. Monica answers it.)
109	Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
110	Phoebe	 Ten dollars an hour for what?
111	Monica	 Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
112	Rachel	 (hurt) Waitressing?
113	Joey	 Uh-oh.
114	Monica	 Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
115	Rachel	 But, but?
116	Monica	 But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
117	Rachel	 Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
118	Chandler	 You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
119	[Scene	 Ross' apartment, Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon (the original, not that cruddy Urge Overkill version) is playing. Ross and Celia are kissing passionately.]
120	Celia	 Talk to me.
121	Ross	 OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
122	Celia	 No no no. Talk... dirty.
123	Ross	 (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
124	Celia	 Yes...
125	Ross	 Ah....
126	Celia	 Say something..... hot.
127	Ross	 (panicked) Er.... um.....
128	Celia	 What?
129	Ross	 Um... uh.... vulva.
130	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Ross are there, discussing what happened last night.]
131	Joey	 (in disbelief) Vulva?
132	Ross	 Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
133	Joey	 (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
134	Ross	 Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
135	Joey	 What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
136	Ross	 (deadpan) Please be kidding.
137	Joey	 Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
138	Ross	 OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
139	Joey	 ....yeah... what else?
140	Ross	 That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)
141	Joey	 (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
142	Ross	 Joey, please.
143	Joey	 Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
144	Ross	 (impressed) Wow.
145	Joey	 Alright, now you say something.
146	Ross	 I... ahem... I really don't think so.
147	Joey	 Come on! You like this woman, right?
148	Ross	 Yeah.
149	Joey	 You want to see her again, right?
150	Ross	 Sure.
151	Joey	 Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
152	Ross	 OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
153	Joey	 (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
154	Ross	 Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
155	Joey	 There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
156	Ross	 I, er...
157		(At this point, Chandler walks into the living room from his bedroom. Ross and Joey both have their backs to him, so they don't notice. Chandler sees the situation and remains quiet, watching.)
158	Ross	 I want to take my tongue... and...
159		(Chandler is completely astounded.)
160	Ross	 ....and....
161	Joey	 Say it... say it!
162	Ross	 ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
163		(Chandler leans back against the wall and Ross and Joey hear him. Ross and Joey both notice at the same time. They slowly stop, and then very slowly turn around to see Chandler staring at them.)
164	Chandler	 (smiling)....with??
165	Ross	 (rushing to explain) Funny story!
166	Joey	 You're not going to believe this!
167	Chandler	 It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
168	Joey	 Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
169	Chandler	 Again?
170	Joey	 And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.
171	Chandler	 (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
172	[Scene	 Chandler's new window office, he is showing Phoebe around.]
173	Chandler	 Well?
174	Phoebe	 (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
175	Chandler	 Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
176	Phoebe	 Oh! You have a window!
177	Chandler	 Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
178	Phoebe	 Oh look! That guy's peeing!
179	Chandler	 (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
180	Phoebe	 (sitting) OK.
181	Chandler	 This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
182		(An unamused woman walks into the office.)
183	Chandler	 Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
184		(She leaves, obviously perturbed.)
185	Chandler	 Last time I do that, I promise.
186	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone. Rachel walks in and overhears the conversation.]
187	Monica	 (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
188	Rachel	 Who was that?
189	Monica	 Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
190	Rachel	 Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
191	Monica	 Ten dollars an hour.
192	Rachel	 No.
193	Monica	 Twelve dollars an hour.
194	Rachel	 Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
195	Monica	 You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
196	Rachel	 Done.
197	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, later. Rachel is waitressing, Monica is cooking. Phoebe walks in with Steve (Crystal Duck winner Jon Lovitz).]
198	Rachel	 Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
199	Monica	 Hi Steve!
200	Steve	 Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.
201	Monica	 (to Steve) This is Rachel.
202	Steve	 (unconcerned) Yeah, OK.
203	Phoebe	 (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.
204	Steve	 It's a lovely apartment.
205	Monica	 Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
206	Steve	 I was just being polite, but, alright.
207		(They leave on the tour and Rachel goes to follow them but Phoebe stops her and drags her into the kitchen.)
208	Rachel	 What's up?
209	Phoebe	 (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
210	Rachel	 What?
211	Phoebe	 Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
212	Rachel	 OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
213	Steve	 (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)
214	Rachel	 Let me, let me get you some wine!
215	Monica	 Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.
216	Steve	 Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
217	Monica	 I'm so glad you liked them!
218	Steve	 Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
219	Monica	 Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
220	Steve	 Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up and goes into the kitchen)
221	Rachel	 Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
222	Steve	 You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
223		(Rachel tries to get Monica's attention to tell her Steve is stoned. She pretends to drag on a joint, and Monica thinks she's giving her the 'OK' signal. Then Rachel does it again, inhaling deeply this time. Monica waves it off as though she doesn't believe it.)
224	Steve	 (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
225	Monica	 (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
226	Steve	 (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)
227	Monica	 You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
228	Steve	 Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
229	Monica	 No, we don't. (reaches for box)
230	Steve	 Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)
231	Monica	 Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
232	Steve	 (childishly) No.
233	Monica	 Give them to me.
234	Steve	 Alright, we'll share.
235	Monica	 No, give me the...
236	Steve	 Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
237	Monica	 (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
238	Steve	 What?
239	Monica	 What?
240	Steve	 Why?
241	Monica	 Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
242		(The oven goes off.)
243	Steve	 (excited) Hey!
244	[Scene	 Central Perk, all are there except Chandler.]
245	Joey	 What a tool!
246	Rachel	 You don't want to work for a guy like that.
247	Ross	 Yeah!
248	Monica	 I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
249	Ross	 Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
250	Phoebe	 Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
251		(Ross gets up and goes over to the counter and Joey follows him.)
252	Joey	 (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?
253	Ross	 Oh, I was unbelievable.
254	Joey	 All right, Ross!
255	Ross	 I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
256	Joey	 Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
257	Ross	 Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
258	Joey	 You cuddled.
259	Ross	 Yeah, which was nice.
260	Phoebe	 You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
261	Rachel	 Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
262	Joey	 Yeah, where the hell is he?
263	[Scene	 Chandler's office, he's on the phone, agitated.]
264	Chandler	 (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
265	[Scene	 Phoebe's massage parlour, she has Steve on the table, and is giving him an extra-painful massage.]
266	Phoebe	 How's this? (presses down hard)
267	Steve	 Eeeee!
268	Phoebe	 Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
269	Steve	 Aaaaah!
270	Phoebe	 See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)
271	Steve	 No.
272	Phoebe	 What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)
273	Steve	 Aaaaahhh!!
274	Phoebe	 There you go! (She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)
275		End
