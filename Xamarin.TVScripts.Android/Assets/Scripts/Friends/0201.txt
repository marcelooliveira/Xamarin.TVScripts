2	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is recapping last season, and as she talks we see a montague of scenes from Ross and Rachel.]
3	Phoebe	 Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
4		Opening Credits
5		[Scene, The Airport, continued from last season, Rachel is waiting for Ross to come of the plane, when she sees he's coming off with another woman.]
6	Rachel	 Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.)
7	Ross	 (seeing her) Rach!
8	Rachel	 Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with the flowers.)
9	Ross	 It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
10	Rachel	 What?
11	Ross	 You're bleeding.
12	Rachel	 I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)
13	Ross	 Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
14	Rachel	 These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly, thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.
15	Julie	 (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.
16	Rachel	 Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
17	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is waiting for Rachel to return from the airport with Ross.]
18	Chandler	 No way!
19	Monica	 I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
20	Phoebe	 Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
21	Joey	 Um, this?
22	Phoebe	 Yes.
23	Monica	 Guys, you got your hair cut.
24	Chandler	 Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
25	Phoebe	 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
26	Rachel	 (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
27	Chandler	 Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
28		(She hits Chandler.)
29	Rachel	 (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter) You, you slowpokes!
30	Ross	 That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
31	Joey	 What up?!
32	Ross	 Everyone, this is Julie.
33	Rachel	 (out of breath) Julie.
34	All	 Ohh. (Happily) Hi!
35	Julie	 Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
36	Ross	 And bus.
37	Julie	 Oh my god.
38	Ross	 The screaming guy?
39	Julie	 And the spitting?
40	Ross	 You gotta hear this story.
41	Julie	 We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
42	Ross	 200 at least.
43	Julie	 ...and this guy...
44	Rachel	 And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
45	Monica	 This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
46	Julie	 Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
47	Ross	 But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
48	Rachel	 Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
49	Monica	 (to Julie) It's an expression.
50	Ross	 Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
51	Julie	 And then we've gotta get some sleep.
52	Ross	 Yeah, it's really 6
53	Chandler	 Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
54		(Ross and Julie exit)
55	Rachel	 Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
56	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Chandler enter.]
57	Ross	 Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
58	Rachel	 Yeah, sure.
59	Ross	 Thank you.
60	Chandler	 Hey, Rach, can I get...
61	Rachel	 Did you talk to him?
62	Chandler	 Not yet.
63	Rachel	 Then, no.
64		(He goes to sit down next to Ross.)
65	Chandler	 So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
66	Ross	 I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
67	Chandler	 God?
68	Ross	 It was you, pal.
69	Chandler	 Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
70	Ross	 Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
71	Chandler	 Well, you owe me one, big guy.
72	Rachel	 (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.
73	Ross	 I didn't order lemonade.
74	Rachel	 Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
75	Ross	 But...
76	Rachel	 Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So uh, what did you find out?
77	Chandler	 He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
78	Rachel	 How is that the silver lining?
79	Chandler	 You have to really wanna see it.
80	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross and the gang is watching Sumo wrestling on TV.]
81	Ross	 Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
82		[Cut to Phoebe and Monica in the kitchen.]
83	Monica	 Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
84	Phoebe	 Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
85	Monica	 No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
86	Phoebe	 All right, so what were you thinking?
87	Monica	 Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
88	Phoebe	 Ohh! No.
89	Monica	 Why not?
90	Phoebe	 Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
91	Monica	 No you're not.
92	Phoebe	 I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
93		(The phone rings.)
94	Joey	 (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)
95	Ross	 (on phone) Hello? Hi.
96	Chandler	 (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
97	Joey	 Needs some clothes altered?
98	Chandler	 No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
99	Joey	 Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All right, when was 1990?
100	Chandler	 Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
101	Ross	 (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up either.
102	Rachel	 She didn't hang up either!
103	Ross	 Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
104	Rachel	 (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
105	Ross	 Rachel! I'll just call her back.
106	Rachel	 Okay!
107	Ross	 (calls Julie back) Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)
108	Rachel	 (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
109	Monica	 Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
110	Rachel	 I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)
111	Chandler	 Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
112	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.]
113	Joey	 (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.
114	Monica	 (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.
115	Phoebe	 I'm still on "no."
116	Rachel	 (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
117	Joey	 No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.
118	Phoebe	 What's goin' on?
119	Rachel	 Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
120	Chandler	 What stupid thing did you do?
121	Paulo	 (entering from Rachel's room) Bon giorno tutti!
122	Phoebe	 Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)
123		Commercial Break
124	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
125	Rachel	 Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)
126	Monica	 Rachel, how did this happen?
127	Rachel	 I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
128	Phoebe	 Where?
129	Rachel	 At his apartment. Is this juice?
130	Joey	 Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
131	Rachel	 Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
132	Monica	 Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
133	Chandler	 People do stupid things when they're upset.
134	Monica	 My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.
135		(Ross and Julie enter.)
136	All	 Hi!
137	Ross	 Hi. Sorry we're late but we wereâ€”well, there was touching.
138	Paulo	 (entering) Hey, hey Ross.
139	Ross	 Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
140	Paulo	 I do Raquel.
141	Ross	 (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.
142	Rachel	 Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
143	Ross	 No, not a problem.
144	Rachel	 Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
145	Phoebe	 (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
146	Chandler	 Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
147	Joey	 Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
148	Chandler	 Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
149	Monica	 (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
150	Phoebe	 All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
151	Monica	 I promise.
152	Phoebe	 All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
153	[Scene	 Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is finishing with her haircut and Monica is whincing.]
154	Phoebe	 All right, that's it, I quit.
155	Monica	 What? I didn't say anything.
156	Phoebe	 Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
157	Monica	 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
158	Phoebe	 Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
159	Monica	 How who wears it?
160	Phoebe	 Demi Moore.
161	Monica	 Demi Moore is not a he.
162	Phoebe	 Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
163	Monica	 That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
164	Phoebe	 Oh. Oh!
165	Monica	 Oh my God!
166	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
167	Monica	 Oh my God!
168	Phoebe	 Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
169	Monica	 She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
170	Phoebe	 Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
171	Monica	 I know!
172	[Scene	 Frank's tailor shop, Chandler is getting his pants measured.]
173	Frankie	 How long do you want the cuffs?
174	Chandler	 At least as long as I have the pants.
175		(Pause as Frankie resumes his work.)
176	Frankie	 I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
177		(He slowly measures it up his leg, and Chandler makes a rather surprised face.)
178	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is recovering from her haircut, Phoebe is playing her doctor and is coming in from the bedroom.]
179	Rachel	 How is she?
180	Phoebe	 It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
181	Ross	 How's the hair?
182	Phoebe	 I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
183	Joey	 Can we see her?
184	Phoebe	 Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
185	Ross	 Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that meant.)
186		(They go into the bedroom leaving Joey and Rachel alone.)
187	Joey	 How're you doing?
188	Rachel	 I'm okay.
189	Joey	 Ooh, that bad, huh?
190	Rachel	 What?
191	Joey	 Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
192	Rachel	 When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
193	Joey	 You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
194	Rachel	 Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
195	Joey	 What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
196	Rachel	 I don't know, I don't know.
197	Joey	 Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
198	Chandler	 (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!
199	Joey	 Frankie? What're you talking about?
200	Ross	 (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)
201	Chandler	 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
202	Ross	 What?
203	Joey	 No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
204	Chandler	 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
205	Ross	 What?
206	Chandler	 Cupping.
207	Joey	 That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
208	Ross	 Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
209	Joey	 What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
210	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, later that day. Monica is now out and about.]
211	Monica	 Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
212	Ross	 I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)
213	Monica	 Thank you. My hair is very amused.
214	Chandler	 Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
215	Phoebe	 (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.
216	Ross	 Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
217	Rachel	 (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?
218	Ross	 Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
219	Rachel	 Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
220	Ross	 Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
221	Joey	 Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
222	Chandler	 That's ok.
223		[Out on the balcony]
224	Ross	 What's goin' on?
225	Rachel	 Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all (Ross is laughing), what?
226	Ross	 Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
227	Rachel	 No. No-no-no-no.
228	Ross	 Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyâ€”I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
229	Rachel	 Really?
230	Ross	 You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?
231	Rachel	 No, I think that was the whole all.
232	Ross	 Okay. Okay. (They hug.) Okay.
233		[Cut back inside, Joey is on the phone.]
234	Joey	 I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
235		Closing Credits
236	[Scene	 Central Perk, Julie is wanting to get her hair cut from Phoebe.]
237	Julie	 I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
238	Phoebe	 Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
239	Julie	 Really?
240	Phoebe	 You wanna do it right now?
241	Julie	 Great! (Julie leaves)
242	Phoebe	 (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
243	Rachel	 No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
244	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
245	Rachel	 You're welcome.
