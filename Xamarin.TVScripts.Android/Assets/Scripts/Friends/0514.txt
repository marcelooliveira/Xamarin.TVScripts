3	Phoebe	 (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
4		(They all run and join her at the window.)
5	Rachel	 I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
6	Ross	 Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
7	Rachel	 Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
8	Chandler	 And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
9	Ross	 Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
10	All	 Good idea! Yes!
11	Ross	 It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
12	Joey	 Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
13	Chandler	 Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
14		Opening Credits
15	[Scene	 Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are checking out the place. Luckily, Ugly Naked Guy is nowhere to be seen.]
16	Ross	 Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
17	Rachel	 Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
18	Phoebe	 It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
19	Ross	 (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)
20	Rachel	 Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)
21	Phoebe	 (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
22	Rachel	 What?!
23	Phoebe	 (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
24	Rachel	 Oh my God!
25	Phoebe	 CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
26	Rachel	 OH MY GOD!!!
27	Phoebe	 OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
28	Rachel	 Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
29	Phoebe	 NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
30	Rachel	 I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
31	Phoebe	 YOU KNOW?!!!
32	Rachel	 Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
33	Ross	 (entering) What's going on?
34	Phoebe and Rachel	 Ohhh!!!
35	Rachel	 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!
36	Ross	 What?! What?!
37	Rachel	 Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
38	Ross	 Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
39	Phoebe	 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
40		(Ross starts jumping and screaming incoherently and hops over and joins in on the group hug.)
41	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there talking about Chandler and Monica.]
42	Phoebe	 You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
43	Rachel	 Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
44	Phoebe	 Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
45	Joey	 (entering) Hey guys!
46	Rachel	 Joey! Come here! Come here!
47	Joey	 What? What?
48	Rachel	 Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
49	Joey	 You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
50	Rachel	 No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
51	Phoebe	 Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
52	Joey	 Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
53	Phoebe	 Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
54	Rachel	 Wh-what do you mean?
55	Phoebe	 Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
56	Rachel	 Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
57	Joey	 No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
58	Rachel	 Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
59	Joey	 I can't take any…
60	Phoebe	 No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
61	Joey	 Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
62	Rachel	 You don't have any secrets!
63	Joey	 Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)
64	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
65	Joey	 Ugh.
66	Phoebe	 Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
67	Rachel	 Okay.
68	Phoebe	 And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
69	Chandler	 (entering) Hello children!
70	All	 Hey!
71	Phoebe	 Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
72		(She gets up and goes over to Chandler who's ordering some coffee from Gunther.)
73	Chandler	 Hey.
74	Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
75	Chandler	 Really?
76	Phoebe	 (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
77	Chandler	 Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
78	Phoebe	 Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.
79	Chandler	 Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
80	Phoebe	 Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
81	Chandler	 What's going on?
82	Phoebe	 I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
83		(She makes a show of bending over to get her coat and showing off her bum. She then walks out, leaving no one to eat her cookie.)
84	[Scene	 Chandler's bedroom, Chandler and Monica are there, of course. Like who else would it be, duh!]
85	Monica	 You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
86	Chandler	 Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
87	Monica	 Okay, now you're even cuter!!
88	Chandler	 Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
89	Monica	 What?
90	Chandler	 The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
91	Monica	 What are you talking about?
92	Chandler	 I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
93	Monica	 That's not possible!
94	Chandler	 Ow!
95	Monica	 I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
96	Chandler	 Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
97	Monica	 I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
98	Chandler	 No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
99	Monica	 This bicep?
100	Chandler	 Well it's not flexed right now!
101	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Chandler are there. Monica is entering from her room.]
102	Rachel	 Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
103	Monica	 Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
104	Rachel	 Oh.
105	Monica	 Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
106	Chandler	 Sure, I'll do it with ya.
107	Monica	 Okay.
108	Rachel	 Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
109	Monica	 I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
110	Phoebe	 I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
111	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
112	Rachel	 Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
113	Ross	 Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
114	Rachel	 Oh.
115	Ross	 No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
116		tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window. (They all head to the window.)
117	Monica	 Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
118	Ross	 No.
119	Chandler	 That new mountain bike?
120	Ross	 No.
121	Monica	 Well what did you send?
122	Ross	 A basket of mini-muffins.
123	Phoebe	 But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
124	Ross	 The small one.
125	Rachel	 What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
126	Ross	 Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
127	Chandler	 Your work makes me sad.
128	Ross	 Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
129	Rachel	 All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
130	Monica	 Bye!
131	All	 Bye!
132	Phoebe	 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
133	Chandler	 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
134	Monica	 Actually, I did!
135	Chandler	 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
136	Monica	 Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
137	Chandler	 Are you serious?
138	Monica	 Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
139	Chandler	 (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!
140		Commercial Break
141	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is snoozing with Hugsy, his bedtime penguin pal and Chandler and Monica come storming in.]
142	Chandler	 (entering) Joey!
143		(Joey quickly tries to hide Hugsy by throwing it over his head.)
144	Joey	 Yeah?
145	Chandler	 Phoebe knows about us!
146	Joey	 Well I didn't tell them!
147	Monica	 Them?! Who's them?
148	Joey	 Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
149	Monica	 Joey!
150	Joey	 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
151	Chandler	 Oh man!
152	Joey	 I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
153	Monica	 Unless…
154	Joey	 No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
155	Monica	 Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…
156	Chandler	 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
157	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is looking at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment through binoculars.]
158	Ross	 Noooo.
159	Rachel	 Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
160	Phoebe	 Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
161	Ross	 Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
162	Rachel	 Y'know what you should do?
163	Ross	 Huh?
164	Rachel	 You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
165	Joey	 I'm listening.
166	Rachel	 (To Ross) See?
167	Ross	 That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
168	Phoebe	 He broke that.
169	Ross	 Well, he had gravity boots.
170	Rachel	 Yeah, he broke those too.
171	Joey	 So he likes to break stuff.
172	Ross	 Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
173	Phoebe	 I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
174	Joey	 Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
175	Ross	 Right. (Exits.)
176		(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)
177	Rachel	 Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.
178	Phoebe	 (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
179	Chandler	 Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
180	Phoebe	 Eh?
181	Chandler	 Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
182	Phoebe	 Really?
183	Chandler	 Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
184	Phoebe	 I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
185	Rachel	 Are you kidding?!
186	Phoebe	 No!
187	Rachel	 I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?
188	Joey	 No.
189	Rachel	 Joey!
190	Joey	 They know you know.
191	Rachel	 Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
192	Phoebe	 God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!
193	Joey	 I couldn't even if I wanted too.
194	[Scene	 Outside Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross is knocks on the door and Ugly Naked Guy answers it. He's ugly. He's naked. And he's holding a huge jumbo soda.]
195	Ross	 Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
196	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica and Rachel and Phoebe are planning their respective strategies to break the other pairing. Joey is not amused.
197	Monica	 (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
198	Chandler	 Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
199	Monica	 Oh yeah!
200		[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.]
201	Phoebe	 All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
202	Rachel	 All right. Be sexy.
203	Phoebe	 (laughs) Please.
204		(She saunters over to Chandler with a mean pair of 'Come hither' eyes and she glares at Monica.)
205	Phoebe	 So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
206	Chandler	 (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
207	Phoebe	 Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
208	Chandler	 Yes.
209	Phoebe	 Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
210		(As she walks away, Chandler mouths a scream to Monica. How motions and mouths, "It's okay, it's okay.")
211	Joey	 (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
212		(They all run over to the window.)
213	Rachel	 Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)
214	All	 Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
215	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Phoebe ready for her date.]
216	Rachel	 Show time!
217	Phoebe	 Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
218	Rachel	 Okay! (She runs to get some.)
219	Phoebe	 And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does so.)
220		(In the meantime, Rachel has returned with the perfume and sprays a mist out in front of Phoebe who walks through the mist and does a little spin.)
221		[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Monica is getting Chandler ready for his half of the plan.]
222	Monica	 All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
223	Chandler	 Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
224	Monica	 Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
225	Chandler	 How do you know?!
226	Monica	 Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
227	Chandler	 At this?!
228	Monica	 Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
229		[Cut to the hallway, Phoebe is outside getting some last minute instructions from Rachel.]
230	Rachel	 (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
231	Phoebe	 Okay.
232	Rachel	 Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)
233	Phoebe	 Good idea!
234	Rachel	 Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)
235	Phoebe	 Oh now, don't give away the farm!
236		(Phoebe knocks on the door with the wine and Chandler answers it. Rachel hides next to the door.)
237	Chandler	 Phoebe.
238	Phoebe	 Chandler.
239	Chandler	 Come on in.
240	Phoebe	 I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
241	Chandler	 Sure.
242		(She makes a big show out of pulling out the cork and pours the wine.)
243	Phoebe	 So, here we are. Nervous?
244	Chandler	 Me? No. You?
245	Phoebe	 No, I want this to happen.
246	Chandler	 So do I.
247		(They click their glasses and take a sip. That sip turns into a gulp, which quickly progresses into their mutual draining of their glasses at once.)
248	Chandler	 I'm gonna put on some music.
249	Phoebe	 Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)
250	Chandler	 You look good.
251	Phoebe	 Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
252	Chandler	 Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
253	Phoebe	 Really?
254	Chandler	 Oh, do you not want to?
255	Phoebe	 No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
256	Chandler	 (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
257		[Cut to the bathroom, Chandler is entering.]
258	Chandler	 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
259	Monica	 She's bluffing!
260	Chandler	 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
261		[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]
262	Phoebe	 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
263	Joey	 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
264	Rachel	 Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
265	Joey	 Ooh!
266	Rachel	 Okay!
267	Joey	 I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
268	Phoebe	 Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.
269	Joey	 It's not my first time.
270		[Cut to the bathroom.]
271	Monica	 You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
272	Chandler	 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
273	Monica	 Of course.
274		[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.)
275	Chandler	 Oh, you're-you're going?
276	Phoebe	 Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
277	Chandler	 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
278	Phoebe	 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
279	Chandler	 Not if I kiss you first.
280		(They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.)
281	Phoebe	 Ooh.
282	Chandler	 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
283	Phoebe	 Here it comes. Our first kiss.
284		(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.)
285	Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
286	Phoebe	 And why not?!
287	Chandler	 Because I'm in love with Monica!!
288	Phoebe	 You're-you're what?!
289		(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)
290	Chandler	 Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
291	Monica	 I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
292	Phoebe	 I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
293	Joey	 Dude!
294	Chandler	 And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.
295	Phoebe	 God! (She turns and buttons up.)
296	Joey	 All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
297	Monica	 Well actually, Ross doesn't.
298	Chandler	 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
299		(Joey suddenly gets very angry.)
