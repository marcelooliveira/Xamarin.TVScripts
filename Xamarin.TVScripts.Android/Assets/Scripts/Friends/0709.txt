2	[Scene	 Central Park, Ross is teaching Ben how to ride a bike. Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there also.]
3	Ben	 (on the bike) I’m ready!
4	Ross	 You sure?
5	Ben	 Uh-huh!
6	Chandler	 Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
7	Ben	 (To Chandler) Thanks daddy.
8	Ross	 No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)
9	Chandler	 Okay. Okay.
10	Ross	 Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
11	Phoebe	 His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!
12	Monica	 Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and…it bent.
13	Ross	 Yeah.
14	Phoebe	 I never had a bike of my own.
15	Ross	 (shocked) What?!
16	Phoebe	 Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
17	Chandler	 That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
18	Ross	 Ohh.
19	Monica	 Did the girl ever let you ride it?
20	Phoebe	 No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
21	Ross	 That is so unfair!
22	Phoebe	 Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod, "Oh.")
23		Opening Credits
24	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is cooking, Joey is eating, and Chandler is entering from the bedroom.]
25	Chandler	 Hey! What are you guys doing?
26	Joey	 Hey.
27	Monica	 Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
28	Chandler	 I’m sorry, who?
29	Monica	 I’m gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
30	Chandler	 But we don’t know the neighbors.
31	Joey	 I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
32	Monica	 See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
33	Chandler	 Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
34	Rachel	 (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!
35	Chandler	 Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!
36	Rachel	 Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
37	Monica	 Where you can make out with your assistant.
38	Rachel	 Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
39	Monica	 Oh yeah, what’s the plan?
40	Rachel	 (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
41	Monica	 Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
42	Rachel	 Well y’know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)
43	Monica	 Did you two…
44	Rachel	 Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!
45	Monica	 Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…
46	Rachel	 Anymore!!
47	Monica	 Okay.
48	[Scene	 Rachel’s Office, she’s at her desk while the mailman delivers her mail and calls Tag in.]
49	Rachel	 Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
50	Tag	 Yes, at 4
51	Rachel	 Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)
52	Tag	 I’d better get back to my desk.
53	Rachel	 Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.
54	Tag	 My what?
55	Rachel	 Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
56	Tag	 Are you serious?
57	Rachel	 No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
58	[Scene	 The Hallway, Monica and Chandler are returning and Monica finds her basket is empty.]
59	Monica	 The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
60	Chandler	 Well, either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)
61	Monica	 Joey!!
62		(She storms into his apartment to find him with a towel around his shoulders, a bowl on his head, and Phoebe with scissors in her hand.)
63	Joey	 Yeah?
64	Monica	 Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
65	Joey	 Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
66	Phoebe	 Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!
67	Monica	 They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! (Starts to do so.)
68	Joey	 Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.
69		(Ross enters.)
70	Monica	 Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
71	Ross	 Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
72	Phoebe	 Sure!
73	Ross	 Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so…
74		(He goes out into the hall and re-enters with a bike exactly like the one Phoebe described earlier.)
75	Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
76	Ross	 You like it?
77	Phoebe	 I love it!!
78	Ross	 Yeah?
79	Phoebe	 Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
80	Ross	 Ahh.
81	Phoebe	 Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
82	Ross	 Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride.
83	Phoebe	 Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.
84	Ross	 (stunned at the compliment) You’re welcome.
85	Phoebe	 (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry.
86	Chandler	 (about to cry) Am not!
87	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the middle of the night, there is someone knocking on the door and Monica and Chandler get up to answer it.]
88	Monica	 (turning a light on) Who is that?!
89	Chandler	 Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
90	The Knocker	 My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
91		(Monica opens the door.)
92	Gary	 Hi!
93	Monica	 Hi. Do you know what time it is?
94	Gary	 It’s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
95	Monica	 Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
96	Chandler	 (laughs) 4
97	Gary	 So, can I get some candy?
98	Chandler	 I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
99	Monica	 Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.
100	Gary	 Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
101	Monica	 Um-hmm.
102	Gary	 (looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you!
103	Chandler	 Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)
104	[Scene	 Rachel’s Office, she’s slinking out to where Tag works and checks to make sure no one is coming.]
105	Rachel	 (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
106	Tag	 No! It was marked confidential, I just sent it down to Human Resources.
107	Rachel	 (worried) Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
108	Tag	 A joke they would appreciate?
109	Rachel	 I’m thinkin’ no.
110	Tag	 What did you say?!
111	Rachel	 Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny tushie.
112	Tag	 No, not my tushie.
113	Rachel	 Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
114	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Ross, and Chandler are watching Phoebe polish the daisies on her bike outside.]
115	Monica	 Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
116	Joey	 Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
117	Chandler	 Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
118	Joey	 (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
119	Ross	 Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
120	Monica	 Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
121	Joey	 Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.
122	Ross	 Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
123		[Cut to outside, they’re going to talk to Phoebe about walking the bike.]
124	Joey	 Hey Pheebs?
125	Phoebe	 Oh hi!
126	Chandler	 Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
127	Phoebe	 Ohh, uh-huh so much!
128	Ross	 Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
129	Phoebe	 Of course!
130	Monica	 Umm, can we see you ride it?
131	Phoebe	 Okay. (The gang is giggles then as Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
132		Commercial Break
133	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy while Chandler and Rachel are taste-testing and Joey is on the couch doodling.]
134	Monica	 See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
135	Chandler	 (with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.
136	Rachel	 Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.
137	Chandler	 Absolutely! Y’know, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker.
138	Rachel	 Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
139	Joey	 Hey Rach?
140	Rachel	 Yeah?
141	Joey	 That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? (He shows her what he’s been drawing.)
142	Rachel	 Oh my God! Joey!
143	Chandler	 What is the matter with you?
144	Rachel	 Ugh!
145	Joey	 Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
146		(There is a knock on the door and Monica answers it. There is a woman standing there.)
147	The Woman	 Hi! I’m sorry, I know it’s after hours but I really need candy.
148	Monica	 I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.) Rules are rules.
149	The Woman	 Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
150	Monica	 No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?
151	The Woman	 I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
152	Monica	 Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
153	The Woman	 Please, can’t you help me out?
154	Joey	 (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
155	Chandler	 Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
156	Monica	 (still talking to the woman) All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!
157	The Woman	 (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
158	Joey and Chandler	 Yeah, that’s her.
159	The Woman	 (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
160	Monica	 (closing the door) It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!
161	Chandler	 Y’know what would work?
162	Monica	 Hmm?
163	Chandler	 Stop making candy!
164	Monica	 But they like it!
165	Chandler	 You mean they like you.
166	Monica	 Maybe.
167	Chandler	 Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
168	Monica	 Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
169	[Scene	 Central Park, Ross is teaching Phoebe how to ride her bike.]
170	Ross	 Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…
171	Phoebe	 (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
172	Ross	 Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
173	Phoebe	 Why? Why do I have to learn?
174	Ross	 Well…In-in case of emergency.
175	Phoebe	 What kind of an emergency?
176	Ross	 Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."
177	Phoebe	 Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
178	Ross	 Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
179	Phoebe	 You won’t let go?
180	Ross	 No!
181	Phoebe	 Swear?!
182	Ross	 I swear!
183	Phoebe	 (thinks it over) Okay.
184	Ross	 Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They start.)
185	Phoebe	 All right.
186	Ross	 All right. Feel good?
187	Phoebe	 Well…
188	Ross	 All right, try pedaling.
189	Phoebe	 Okay. (Does so.)
190	Ross	 That’s it, your doing great.
191	Phoebe	 Okay.
192	Ross	 Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
193	Phoebe	 Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
194	Ross	 Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
195	Phoebe	 Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
196	Ross	 I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
197	Phoebe	 I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
198	Ross	 It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
199	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy like mad as Ross enters.]
200	Ross	 Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.
201	Monica	 Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!
202	Ross	 Need some help?
203	Monica	 No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!
204	Ross	 By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)
205		[Cut to Phoebe’s room, Phoebe has put her helmet on one of her teddy bears and is playing around with it. Ross knocks and pokes his head in the door.]
206	Phoebe	 (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.
207	Ross	 (entering) Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
208	Phoebe	 I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
209	Ross	 I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
210	Phoebe	 Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
211	Ross	 Phoebe.
212	Phoebe	 What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
213	Ross	 All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.
214	Phoebe	 What?! Why?!
215	Ross	 Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
216	Phoebe	 All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
217	Ross	 Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very happy.
218	Phoebe	 (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don’t die!
219	[Scene	 Rachel’s office, Tag and her are planning how to get the review back.]
220	Rachel	 Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
221	Tag	 That’s kinda sad.
222	Rachel	 Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
223	Tag	 Got it!
224	Rachel	 Let’s roll!
225		(They start towards the door but are stopped when Mr. Zelner enters.)
226	Mr. Zelner	 Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
227	Rachel	 (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)
228	Mr. Zelner	 Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you.
229	Rachel	 Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
230	Mr. Zelner	 Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty. (Rachel glances at Tag to say, "See?") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
231	Rachel	 (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
232	Mr. Zelner	 Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
233	Rachel	 Well…
234	Tag	 (interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that evaluation.
235	Rachel	 Oh no-no-no…
236	Tag	 (interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
237	Mr. Zelner	 You wrote that you have a cute tushie?
238	Tag	 (pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda strangely proud of my butt.
239	Mr. Zelner	 It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can’t figure out what this is?
240	Rachel	 You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter.
241	Mr. Zelner	 Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh, you’ve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)
242	Rachel	 Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.
243	Tag	 No, don’t worry about it.
244	Rachel	 No, you could’ve lost your job.
245	Tag	 Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work.
246	Rachel	 Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)
247	Tag	 Y’know what?
248	Rachel	 What?
249	Tag	 I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?
250	Rachel	 I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
251	Tag	 Oh, I’m sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)
252	Rachel	 (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
253	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler is returning from work to see the hallway jammed full of people waiting outside their door.]
254	Chandler	 (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
255	The Man	 We’re waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out the candy!
256	Joey	 Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
257	Chandler	 Joey!
258	Joey	 What’s up buddy?
259	Chandler	 What are you doing?
260	Joey	 Waiting for candy.
261	Chandler	 Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
262	Monica	 (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
263	All	 We want candy! We want candy now! (And other general commotion sounds.)
264	Chandler	 All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
265	The Man	 (from earlier) Candy Lady?
266	Chandler	 No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
267	Joey	 (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
268	Chandler	 All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!
269	Joey	 That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)
270	Monica	 (To Chandler) Thank you.
271	Chandler	 You’re welcome. (They kiss.)
272	Monica	 Did you smoke?
273	Chandler	 No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?
274	Monica	 I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
275	Joey	 (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know… (Grabs the note.)
276		Ending Credits
277	[Scene	 Central Park, Phoebe is now riding her bike with ease and stops in front of Ross. They both giggle.]
278	Phoebe	 I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
279	Ross	 Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
280	Phoebe	 Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. (She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)
