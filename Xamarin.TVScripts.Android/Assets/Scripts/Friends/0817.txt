2	[Scene	 The Hallway, Rachel walks up the stairs and knocks on Joey’s door.]
3	Rachel	 Joey? Are you in there?
4		[Cut to inside Monica and Chandler’s, Monica, Chandler and Joey are eating breakfast.]
5	Joey	 (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That’s Rachel!
6	Monica	 Joey, you have to talk to her!
7	Joey	 No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)
8	Rachel	 Hey!
9	Chandler	 Hey!
10	Monica	 Hey Rachel!
11	Rachel	 Is Joey here?
12	Chandler	 I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
13	Monica	 I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
14	Rachel	 Well, at least you make each other laugh.
15	Monica	 What’s up?
16	Rachel	 Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
17	Monica	 We were playing a game.
18	Rachel	 Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
19	Monica	 Sure.
20	Chandler	 What?! No! No!
21	Rachel	 All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)
22	Monica	 (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?
23	Joey	 Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.
24	Monica	 Honey, you gotta talk to her.
25	Joey	 I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
26	Chandler	 (incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
27	Monica	 Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.
28	Joey	 All right so, so what do I do?
29	Monica	 This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.
30	Joey	 Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…
31	Chandler	 (interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!
32		Opening Credits
33	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is holding a book as she, Rachel, and Monica drink some tea as Chandler looks on.]
34	Phoebe	 Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
35	Chandler	 I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
36	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
37	Monica	 Okay, I’m done. Read mine.
38	Phoebe	 Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
39	Monica	 (stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.
40	Phoebe	 Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?
41	Rachel	 Okay, I’m done. Do mine.
42	Phoebe	 Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
43	Rachel	 Ah.
44	Phoebe	 Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!
45	Rachel	 Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
46	Chandler	 What does yours say Pheebs?
47	Phoebe	 Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
48	Ross	 (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
49	Monica	 You mean your pink shirt?
50	Ross	 Faded salmon color.
51	Monica	 No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.
52	Ross	 Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
53	Chandler	 Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.
54	Ross	 That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
55	Rachel	 Well just ask Mona to give it back!
56	Ross	 I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)
57	Phoebe	 (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)
58	Chandler	 Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
59		(Joey enters.)
60	Rachel	 Hi!
61	Joey	 Hey.
62		(He slowly walks to the other side of the couch and sits down at the table, an awkward silence follows.)
63	Rachel	 Hi.
64	Joey	 Hi.
65		(More awkward silence.)
66	Monica	 Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
67	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is cooking as Rachel paces nervously.]
68	Rachel	 So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
69	Chandler	 I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.
70	Rachel	 How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!
71	Chandler	 I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
72	Monica	 Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
73	Chandler	 Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
74	Monica	 Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
75	Chandler	 In the James Taylor case.
76	Monica	 Where is the James Taylor CD?
77	Chandler	 Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
78	Monica	 Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
79	Chandler	 Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?
80	Monica	 Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.
81	Rachel	 Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
82	Monica	 Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
83	Rachel	 Oh yeah. That makes sense.
84	Monica	 Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
85	Rachel	 Ooh, I can do that.
86	Monica	 Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
87	Chandler	 They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look) in exchange for money.
88	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
89	Rachel	 Hi.
90	Monica	 Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
91	Rachel	 What?
92	Monica	 Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’re gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)
93	Joey	 So you uh, have a…big work problem?
94	Rachel	 Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.
95	Joey	 Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.
96	Rachel	 Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.
97	Joey	 Yeah?
98	Rachel	 Yeah, and umm my baby.
99	Joey	 Yeah?
100	Rachel	 My boss wants to buy my baby!
101	Joey	 What?! Oh my-oh my God!
102	Rachel	 I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.
103	Joey	 What he wants to buy your baby?!
104	Rachel	 Can you believe that?!
105	Joey	 That’s crazy!
106	Rachel	 That’s what I told him!
107	Joey	 Okay, how did this even happen?
108	Rachel	 Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
109	Joey	 Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
110	Rachel	 Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.
111	[Scene	 A newsstand, Phoebe is looking at a magazine as the guy from before walks by and picks up a newspaper.]
112	Phoebe	 Oh hello.
113	Guy	 Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson.
114	Phoebe	 Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
115	Jim	 We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?
116	Phoebe	 Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)
117	[Scene	 Outside Mona’s Apartment, Ross is knocking on the door.]
118	Ross	 Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
119	Mona	 (entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
120	Mona's Date	 Oh, it’s okay.
121	Mona	 No, it’s still wet. Y’know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Ross’s shirt.)
122	Mona's Date	 Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt.
123	Mona	 No-no that’s a man’s shirt.
124	Mona's Date	 It’s awfully pink. (Ross mouths, "It’s salmon!")
125	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are sorting their CDs.]
126	Chandler	 Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
127	Monica	 Honey, both yours.
128	Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
129	Monica	 Yeah? The work problem?
130	Rachel	 Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
131	Chandler	 What problem did you tell him you had?
132	Rachel	 Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
133	[Scene	 Mr. Zelner’s Office, he’s in a meeting as Joey bursts in.]
134	Mr. Zelner	 May I help you?
135	Joey	 Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
136		Commercial Break
137	[Scene	 A restaurant, Phoebe and Jim are on their date.]
138	Phoebe	 Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.
139	Jim	 Someone does. Me.
140	Phoebe	 Oh, witty banter. Well done.
141	Jim	 So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
142	Phoebe	 Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…
143	Jim	 Do you like to party?
144	Phoebe	 I-I-I like, I like parties.
145	Jim	 You’re wild, aren’t ya?
146	Phoebe	 Yeah I guess, a little.
147	Jim	 It ain’t no thing, I’m wild too.
148	Phoebe	 (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.
149	Jim	 I’m sorry. I’m staring. It’s just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
150	Phoebe	 Oh stop it.
151	Jim	 And your breasts! Hmm!!!
152	Phoebe	 Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
153	Jim	 All right.
154	Phoebe	 Okay.
155	Jim	 I write erotic novels, for children.
156	Phoebe	 What?!
157	Jim	 They’re wildly unpopular.
158	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
159	Jim	 Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
160	Phoebe	 Wow! You do?
161	Jim	 Yeah, (looks at his crotch) a Pretty Huge…
162	Phoebe	 All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
163	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, and now Rachel are organizing CDs.]
164	Chandler	 (singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there’ll be sun.
165	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
166	Rachel	 Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
167	Joey	 Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
168	Rachel	 (worried) What?
169	Joey	 Let’s just say I took care of it.
170	Rachel	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!
171	Joey	 Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!"
172	Rachel	 What?!
173	Chandler and Monica	 What?!
174	Rachel	 No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!
175	Joey	 What?! Why?!
176	Rachel	 So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!
177	Joey	 And you couldn’t think of anything else?!
178	Monica	 You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
179	Rachel	 (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
180	Chandler	 You can always sell your baby.
181	Rachel	 Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!
182	Joey	 You lied to me!
183	Rachel	 Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
184	Monica	 Chandler has two copies of Annie!
185	[Scene	 Mona’s Apartment, she and her date are making out as Ross flips through a magazine while lying behind the couch and sees something that he likes. Meanwhile, Mona’s date takes off Ross’s shirt and Mona throws it on the floor. While they start making out again, Ross tries to pull the rug the shirt is on over to him, but while he does that he moves the coffee table and it bumps into the couch.]
186	Mona	 (seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!
187	Ross	 Hello!!
188	Mona	 Ross, what are you doing?!
189	Ross	 Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
190	[Scene	 Mr. Zelner’s Office, Rachel is knocking on the door.]
191	Rachel	 Morning. You wanted to see me?
192	Mr. Zelner	 Please, come in. Have a seat. (She does so.)
193	Rachel	 Okay look Mr. Zelner…
194	Mr. Zelner	 Oh I think it’s best that I speak first.
195	Rachel	 Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
196	Mr. Zelner	 I’ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
197	Rachel	 Oh God.
198	Mr. Zelner	 If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby…I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
199	Rachel	 Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
200	[Scene	 A Street, Phoebe and Monica are walking down it.]
201	Phoebe	 Oh there it is.
202	Monica	 That’s not your regular dry cleaners.
203	Phoebe	 I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…
204	Monica	 What?!
205	Phoebe	 A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.
206	Monica	 Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
207	Phoebe	 Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
208		(They enter the dry cleaners.)
209	Phoebe	 Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.
210	Monica	 Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
211	Phoebe	 Okay.
212		(A guy enters that looks suspiciously like Alec Baldwin from The Hunt for Red October, Pearl Harbor, and Beetlejuice.)
213	Guy	 (To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s…(looks at Phoebe.) Wow!
214	Phoebe	 What?
215	Guy	 I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful.
216	Phoebe	 Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
217	Guy	 I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
218	Phoebe	 A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now you’re talking.
219	Guy	 Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
220	Phoebe	 I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
221	Monica	 (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
222	Phoebe	 (looking around) She must’ve left.
223	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching Joey pace nervously as Rachel enters.]
224	Rachel	 Hi.
225	Joey	 So? What-what-what happened?
226	Rachel	 It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
227	Chandler	 Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.
228	Rachel	 Chandler, can you give us a minute?
229	Chandler	 Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
230	Rachel	 Yeah.
231	Chandler	 I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
232	Rachel	 Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…
233	Joey	 I know. I know.
234	Rachel	 It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.
235	Joey	 Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.
236	Rachel	 Yeah I know! I miss that.
237	Joey	 Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
238		(Awkward silence.)
239	Rachel	 My gynecologist tried to kill me.
240		Closing Credits
241	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's, Ross is ordering something over the phone from a catalog.]
242	Ross	 (on phone) Item J437-A, color
243	Mona	 (interrupting him) Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
244	Ross	 You do?
245	Mona	 Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.
246	Ross	 (faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.
247	Mona	 Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go. (She picks up the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?
248	Ross	 (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
