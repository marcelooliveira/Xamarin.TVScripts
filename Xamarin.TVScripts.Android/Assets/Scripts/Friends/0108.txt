2	[Scene	 Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break. Shelley enters.) Shelley
3	Chandler	 Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
4	Shelley	 Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
5	Chandler	 Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
6	Shelley	 Do you want a date Saturday?
7	Chandler	 Yes please.
8	Shelley	 Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
9	Chandler	 He's a he?
10	Shelley	 Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...
11		Opening Credits
12	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.)
13	Chandler	 ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
14	Rachel	 Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
15	Chandler	 You did?
16	Rachel	 Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
17	Chandler	 Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
18	Monica	 I did.
19	Phoebe	 Yeah, I think so, yeah.
20	Joey	 Not me.
21	Ross	 Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
22	Chandler	 You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
23	Ross	 No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
24		(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler's look and abruptly stops.)
25	Chandler	 Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
26	Phoebe	 I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
27	Chandler	 Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
28	All	 Yeah! Right!
29	Chandler	 WHAT IS IT?!
30	Monica	 Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
31	All	 Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
32	Chandler	 Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
33		(Phone rings; Monica gets it)
34	Monica	 Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
35	Rachel	 Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
36	Ross	 (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
37	Rachel	 Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
38	Monica	 Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
39	[Scene	 The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)
40	Ross	 So, uh, how's she doing?
41	Aunt Lillian	 The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
42	Monica	 How-how are you, Mom?
43	Mrs. Geller	 Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
44	Monica	 What?
45	Mrs. Geller	 What's different?
46	Monica	 Nothing.
47	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, maybe that's it.
48		(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)
49	Monica	 She is unbelievable, our mother is...
50	Ross	 Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
51	Monica	 Oh God!
52		(They hug.)
53		[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]
54	Monica	 The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
55	Ross	 Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
56	Mr. Geller	 Not just restaurants, from our house.
57		(The nurse comes out of Nana's room.)
58	Nurse	 Mrs. Geller?
59		(Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana's room.)
60	Ross	 She looks so small.
61	Monica	 I know.
62	Ross	 Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
63	Monica	 G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
64	Ross	 Bye, Nana.
65		(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in disbelief. Monica runs out of the room.)
66	Monica	 Ross!
67		(Ross runs out too.)
68	Mrs. Geller	 What is going on?!
69	Ross	 Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
70	Mrs. Geller	 What?
71	Ross	 She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
72	Aunt Lillian	 (reentering) What's going on?
73	Mr. Geller	 She may have died.
74	Aunt Lillian	 She may have died?
75	Mr. Geller	 We're looking into it.
76		(Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana's room.)
77	Ross	 I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
78	Nurse	 This almost never happens!
79		(Nana passes for the second time and the nurse pulls the blanket over her. Ross and Monica go to tell the family)
80	Ross	 Now she's passed.
81	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there.]
82	Chandler	 I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
83	Rachel	 (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
84	Phoebe	 Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
85		(Monica and Ross enter.)
86	Rachel	 So, um, did she...
87	Ross	 Twice.
88	Joey	 Twice?
89	Phoebe	 Oh, that sucks!
90	Joey	 You guys okay?
91	Ross	 I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
92	Phoebe	 Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
93	Ross	 Nono, she's gone.
94	Monica	 We checked. A lot.
95	Phoebe	 Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
96	Rachel	 Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)
97	Phoebe	 Thanks!
98	Rachel	 Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
99	Joey	 Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
100	Phoebe	 Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)
101	[Scene	 Nana's house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.]
102	Ross	 I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
103	Mrs. Geller	 Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
104		(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)
105	Mrs. Geller	 Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
106	Ross	 (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
107		(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)
108	Ross	 Here's my retainer!
109	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to her father.]
110	Mr. Geller	 I was just thinking. When my time comes-
111	Monica	 Dad!
112	Mr. Geller	 Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
113	Monica	 You what?
114	Mr. Geller	 I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
115	Monica	 Define fun.
116	Mr. Geller	 C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
117	Monica	 ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
118	Mr. Geller	 Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
119	Monica	 That's probably what they'll say.
120	Mr. Geller	 I'd like that.
121	[Scene	 Chandler's Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters.]
122	Chandler	 Hey, gorgeous.
123	Shelley	 (sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
124	Chandler	 No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
125	Shelley	 Oh! Okay! Phew!
126	Chandler	 So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
127	Shelley	 I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
128	Chandler	 ...Quality, right, great.
129	Shelley	 Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
130	Chandler	 Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
131	Shelley	 What? He's cute!
132	Chandler	 Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
133	Shelley	 Is Brian...?
134	Chandler	 No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
135	Shelley	 Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
136	Chandler	 Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
137	[Scene	 Nana's Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet.]
138	Ross	 (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
139	Aunt Lillian	 No.
140	Ross	 I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
141	Aunt Lillian	 You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
142	Mrs. Geller	 You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
143	Ross	 Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
144	Aunt Lillian	 Wait! We need shoes!
145		(Ross falls back inside)
146	Ross	 Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
147	Mrs. Geller	 That's really a day shoe.
148	Ross	 And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
149	Aunt Lillian	 Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
150	Ross	 (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
151	Aunt Lillian	 No, it really should be burgundy.
152	Mrs. Geller	 Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
153	Ross	 No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
154		(He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of Sweet 'n' Lo's.)
155	Ross	 Oh my God..
156	Mrs. Geller	 Is everything all right, dear?
157	Ross	 Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
158		(He reaches up higher and knocks down another shoebox lid. Sweet 'n' Lo's rain down on him)
159		Commercial Break
160	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral.]
161	Ross	 (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
162	Monica	 Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
163	Ross	 Some days it's all I can think about.
164	Phoebe	 (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
165	Rachel	 Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
166	Phoebe	 What'd I say?
167	Rachel	 (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
168	Monica	 Are these the shoes?
169	Rachel	 Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
170	Ross	 What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
171	Joey	 (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
172	Chandler	 Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
173		(They all leave.)
174	[Scene	 The cemetary, after the funeral.]
175	Monica	 It was a really beautiful service.
176	Mrs. Geller	 It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
177		(Joey listens to his overcoat for a second and sighs, then notices Chandler watching)
178	Joey	 What?
179	Chandler	 Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
180	Joey	 Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)
181	Chandler	 You're watching a football game at a funeral?
182	Joey	 No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
183	Chandler	 You are a frightening, frightening man.
184		(Rachel steps in a patch of mud)
185	Rachel	 Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
186	Ross	 Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
187	Phoebe	 God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
188	Ross	 I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)
189	All	 God! Ross!
190	Ross	 I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
191	[Scene	 The Wake, at the Gellers' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe squatting over him, checking to see if he's injured.]
192	Phoebe	 Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
193	Ross	 What, what is it?
194	Phoebe	 You missed a belt loop.
195	Ross	 Oh! No-n-
196	Phoebe	 Okay, it's in spasm.
197	Mrs. Geller	 Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)
198		(Cut to Chandler and a woman, Andrea, reaching for the same slice of meat)
199	Chandler	 Oh, no-
200	Andrea	 Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
201	Chandler	 Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
202		(They shake hands. Cut to Ross emerging from a hallway, grinning inanely. He is obviously very stoned)
203	Phoebe	 Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
204	Ross	 I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
205	Monica	 Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
206	Ross	 Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
207	Phoebe	 Ooh! That's so nice...
208	Ross	 ...Chandler!
209	Chandler	 Hey.
210	Ross	 (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
211	Andrea	 (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)
212	Ross	 Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
213	Rachel	 (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?
214	Ross	 No.
215	Rachel	 You!
216	Ross	 Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
217		(Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of disappointment.)
218	Mr. Geller	 Whaddya got there?
219	Joey	 (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing disability.
220	Mr. Geller	 What's the score?
221	Joey	 Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
222	Mr. Geller	 Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
223		(Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game)
224	Rachel	 (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
225	Mrs. Geller	 (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.
226	Monica	 Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
227	Mrs. Geller	 No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
228	Monica	 That sounds like Nana.
229	Mrs. Geller	 Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
230	Monica	 ...I can imagine.
231	Mrs. Geller	 I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
232	Monica	 That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
233	Mrs. Geller	 Tell her what?
234	Monica	 How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
235	Mrs. Geller	 I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
236	Monica	 Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
237	Mrs. Geller	 ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
238	Monica	 Huh.
239	Mrs. Geller	 More wine, dear?
240	Monica	 Oh, I think so.
241	Mrs. Geller	 (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you.
242	Monica	 Thank you. They're yours.
243	Mrs. Geller	 Actually they were Nana's.
244		(There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.)
245	Mr. Geller	 Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.
246	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang are looking at old photos.]
247	Rachel	 Hey, who's this little naked guy?
248	Ross	 That little naked guy would be me.
249	Rachel	 Aww, look at the little thing.
250	Ross	 Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
251	Chandler	 Who are those people?
252	Ross	 Got me.
253	Monica	 Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
254	Rachel	 Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
255	Monica	 Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
256	Ross	 Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
257	Joey	 Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
258	Ross	 (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
259		Closing Credits
260	[Scene	 Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break as Lowell enters.]
261	Chandler	 Hey, Lowell.
262	Lowell	 Hey, Chandler.
263	Chandler	 So how's it going there in Financial Services?
264	Lowell	 It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
265	Chandler	 Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
266	Lowell	 I know. That's what I told her.
267	Chandler	 Really.
268	Lowell	 Yeah.
269	Chandler	 So- you can tell?
270	Lowell	 Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
271	Chandler	 So you don't think I have a, a quality?
272	Lowell	 Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
273	Chandler	 He is?
274	Lowell	 Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)
275	Chandler	 Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
