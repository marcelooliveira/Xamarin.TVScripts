2	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey is reading What to Expect When You’re Expecting as Rachel enters from her bedroom.]
3	Joey	 Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
4	Rachel	 (looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)
5	Joey	 (laughing) You fall for it every time!
6	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
7	Rachel	 Hi!
8	Phoebe	 I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
9	Rachel	 Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh, those are so cute!
10	Phoebe	 Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons.
11	Monica	 (entering) Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o’clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
12	Rachel	 No.
13	Monica	 He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
14	Rachel	 Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
15	Monica	 No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.
16	Rachel	 Oh that’s nice.
17	Monica	 Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.
18	Joey	 I just want you to say it once in a while.
19	Monica	 All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.
20	Joey	 What?!
21	Monica	 Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…
22	Joey	 Phoebe!
23	Phoebe	 Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!
24	Joey	 No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!
25	Monica	 All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.
26	Joey	 She is?
27	Rachel	 Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
28	Joey	 Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
29	Monica	 Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.
30	Joey	 But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
31	Monica	 All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
32	Joey	 No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!
33	Monica	 All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
34	Joey	 That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
35		Opening Credits
36	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching football, and it’s actually the right game Green Bay at Detroit (although not this year’s), as Monica is getting everything ready.]
37	Monica	 Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!
38	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
39	Monica	 Hey!
40	Phoebe	 Happy Thanksgiving!
41	Monica	 You too!
42	Phoebe	 Anything I can do to help?
43	Monica	 Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)
44	Phoebe	 Sure!
45	Monica	 I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
46	Phoebe	 Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
47	Monica	 No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
48	Phoebe	 Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how’s the game?
49	Chandler	 I have no idea.
50	Phoebe	 What?
51	Chandler	 Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.
52	Phoebe	 I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
53	Chandler	 Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
54		(Monica enters and Chandler screams stuff at the TV.)
55	Monica	 Is your team winning hon?
56	Chandler	 Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no Anderson.
57	Phoebe	 Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.
58	Monica	 Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.
59	Phoebe	 Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at the TV)…Green Bay is playing.
60	Monica	 You like Green Bay?
61	Phoebe	 Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
62		(Phoebe joins Chandler on the couch as there is a knock on the door which Monica answers.)
63	Monica	 Hey!
64	Will	 Hey!
65		(Oh, I should point out that the live studio audience at this point goes absolutely wild. And I had absolutely no idea that this Will character was that popular! Maybe they should make him the seventh friend. Which would work out just fine since he’s already married to one of them. Will is played by some guy named Brad Pitt, I guess he’s some sort of actor.)
66	Will	 Happy Thanksgiving!
67	Monica	 Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…
68	Will	 150 pounds. Yeah, I’m gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
69	Monica	 A pie! (Will brought a pie.)
70	Will	 Oh right. All right, it’s no fat, it’s no sugar, it’s no dairy…it’s no good. Throw it out.
71	Monica	 You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
72	Will	 Hey.
73	Chandler	 Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.
74	Monica	 This is Phoebe.
75	Phoebe	 (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.
76	Monica	 (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?
77	Will	 Sure! Monica, I can’t get over how great you look! You look stunning!
78	Monica	 Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!
79	Chandler	 I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!
80	Monica	 Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
81	Will	 Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
82	Monica	 Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)
83	Will	 Oh.
84	Monica	 Is there a problem?
85	Will	 Nope. Uh, it’s okay. It’s just uh, God I hated her.
86	Monica	 What?
87	Will	 Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I’m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!
88	Chandler	 (To Phoebe) Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.
89	Phoebe	 Oh okay.
90	Chandler	 Oh come on!
91	Phoebe	 Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
92		(Joey enters eating potato chips.)
93	Monica	 Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.
94	Joey	 Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.
95	Monica	 All right.
96	Joey	 Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.
97	Will	 I actually know what you’re talking about. I’m here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
98	Joey	 (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
99	Monica	 Will! From high school.
100	Joey	 Oh hey!
101	Monica	 (to Will) Joey.
102	Will	 Hello.
103	Ross	 (entering) Will!
104	Will	 Ross!
105	Ross	 Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
106	Will	 It’s good to see you man.
107	Ross	 Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
108	Will	 I’m a commodities broker.
109	Ross	 Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
110	Will	 Yeah, it’s not. But I’m rich and thin.
111	Ross	 Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’ graduation party.
112	Will	 That was such a fun night!
113	Ross	 Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
114	Will	 Yeah.
115	Ross	 Yeah.
116	Will	 God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
117	Ross	 (laughs) Yeah.
118	Will	 So what do you, what do you do now?
119	Ross	 So how long are you in town?
120	Rachel	 (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!
121	Monica	 Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)
122	Will	 (glaring at Rachel) Rachel Green.
123	Ross	 Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
124	Will	 Oh, I’ll-I’ll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
125	Ross	 Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
126	Will	 Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross
127	Rachel	 (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?
128	Monica	 That’s Will from high school!
129	Rachel	 Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me, but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")
130	Monica	 Okay, dinner’s ready!
131	Chandler	 Good game!
132	Phoebe	 Yeah.
133	Chandler	 Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
134	Monica	 Oh, so who won?
135	Phoebe	 (simultaneously) Green Bay.
136	Chandler	 (simultaneously) Detroit.
137	Monica	 What?
138	Phoebe	 Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.
139		(They sit down at the table and Will goes to talk to Rachel.)
140	Rachel	 Hi! Will, right?
141	Will	 Right.
142	Rachel	 Hi! I’m Rachel Green.
143	Will	 Oh I-I remember you.
144	Rachel	 Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?
145	Will	 You are unbelievable.
146	Rachel	 Thank you!
147	Monica	 (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don’t you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)
148		(Monica sets something on the table and removes the cover. It kinda looks like turkey.)
149	Joey	 That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
150	Monica	 (laughs) This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)
151	Joey	 (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?
152	Monica	 About nineteen pounds.
153	Joey	 (To Rachel) It’s like me when I was born.
154	Rachel	 All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
155	Will	 Oh, you’d like that wouldn’t ya?
156	Rachel	 What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y’know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
157	Will	 (sneeze talks) Typical.
158	Rachel	 I’m sorry. What?
159	Will	 I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair flip.)
160	Joey	 (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?
161	Rachel	 Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
162	Will	 I don’t know? Do I? Do I?
163	Phoebe	 I think you do.
164	Monica	 (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
165	Will	 A little mean? You made my life miserable!
166	Rachel	 I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…
167	Will	 Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
168	Monica	 Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…
169	Will	 Yams!!!!
170	Monica	 Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.)
171	Rachel	 Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…
172	Will	 Oh, it wasn’t just me. We had a club!
173	Rachel	 You had a club?!
174	Will	 That’s right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
175	Rachel	 Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
176	Will	 Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)
177	Ross	 No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
178		Commercial Break
179	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.]
180	Rachel	 (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
181	Will	 Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a high-five.)
182	Ross	 No. No.
183	Rachel	 So who else was in this club?
184	Ross	 Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
185	Rachel	 So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
186	Will	 You went out with her?! We had a pact!
187	Ross	 That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
188	Will	 Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
189	Rachel	 Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
190	Monica	 I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
191	Ross and Will	 Yeah.
192	Monica	 Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
193	Ross	 Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…
194	Will	 Co-founded!
195	Ross	 …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
196	Will	 Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
197	Rachel	 Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
198	Will	 Well, we did a little more than that.
199	Ross	 No-no! No-no. No-no.
200	Phoebe	 What?! What else did you do?
201	Will	 We started a rumor.
202	Rachel	 What rumor?
203	Phoebe	 Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
204	Rachel	 Ross!
205	Ross	 It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
206	Rachel	 What?!
207	Will	 That’s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
208	Rachel	 (shocked) Oh my God!
209	Monica	 You started that?!
210	Rachel	 What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
211	Monica	 Everyone at our school heard it!
212	Chandler	 Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
213	Rachel	 Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
214	Ross	 Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
215	Rachel	 Monica, how come you never told me this?!
216	Monica	 I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
217		(Joey is now looking at Rachel, and since Rachel’s standing and he’s sitting down and he’s not looking at her face… You get the picture.)
218	Rachel	 Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
219	Joey	 I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
220	Rachel	 Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
221		[Time Lapse, dinner has ended for everyone except Joey who looks like to have finished the turkey, until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side.]
222	Joey	 You are my Everest.
223	Monica	 Joey, you don’t have to finish that.
224	Joey	 Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
225	Rachel	 (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you’re such a good person." Not girl! Person!
226	Ross	 Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.
227	Rachel	 (reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, you’re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)
228	Ross	 Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!
229	Rachel	 Yes!
230	Will	 Could you also tell them I’m skinny now?
231	Monica	 Oh! Me too!
232	Ross	 Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
233	Rachel	 I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
234	Monica	 That’s not totally true.
235	Rachel	 What?
236	Ross	 What?
237	Monica	 Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
238	Ross	 (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
239	Monica	 It’s true?!!
240	Ross	 No.
241	Rachel	 Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
242		(Ross is at a loss for words.)
243	Will	 Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
244	Chandler	 I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
245	Ross	 Hey! She didn’t look 50!
246	Chandler	 Did she look 16?
247	Rachel	 Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
248	Phoebe	 Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
249	Ross	 She didn’t photograph well!
250	Chandler	 Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
251	Phoebe	 So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
252	Ross	 I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…
253	Monica	 Didn’t she walk with a cane?
254	Ross	 Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the club!
255	Will	 Yeah! (They high-five.)
256	Phoebe	 I wanna join!
257	Rachel	 Wh—Phoebe!!
258	Phoebe	 I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
259	Rachel	 All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
260	Monica	 All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
261	Rachel	 Wow…
262	Monica	 And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
263	Ross	 As a romancer of the elderly.
264	Monica	 Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
265	Ross	 The eyes…did still sparkle.
266	Monica	 Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?
267	Rachel	 She’s right.
268	Ross	 Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
269	Will	 Hold on! You got her pregnant?
270	Ross	 Yeah.
271	Will	 Are ya getting married?
272	Ross	 Nope.
273	Will	 So you knocked her up but you’re not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wants another high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?
274	Phoebe	 Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.
275	Joey	 (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right where’s that turkey!
276	Phoebe	 Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
277	Joey	 Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
278		Closing Credits
279	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Will has left and the rest of the gang is watching Joey finish the turkey.]
280	Joey	 Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
281	Monica	 Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.
282	Chandler	 Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
283	Phoebe	 Is there anything we can do for you?
284	Joey	 No just, nobody press on my stomach.
285	Rachel	 You can keep those pants by the way.
286		(Joey notices Monica has gotten a pie.)
287	Joey	 Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
288	Monica	 Yeah, you want some?
289	Joey	 Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
290		End
