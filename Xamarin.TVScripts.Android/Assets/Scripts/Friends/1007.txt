7		(Joey and Ross enter. Phoebe and Mike are sitting on the couch, reading a magazine.)
8	Ross	 Hey you guys!
9	Phoebe	 Hey!
10	Ross	 Hey, what are you doing?
11	Mike	 Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
12	Chandler	 That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
13	Ross	 Yeah!
14	Phoebe	 It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
15	Chandler	 Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
16	Phoebe	 So what did you two do about it?
17	Chandler	 It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
18	Ross	 There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
19	Mike	 I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
20	Ross	 Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
21	Phoebe	 But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
22	Mike	 Are you serious?
23	Phoebe	 Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
24	Mike	 I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. (he kisses her)
25	Ross	 I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
26	Chandler	 (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
27	Ross	 No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!
28		Opening Credits
29	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment]
30		(Monica is cleaning the table, Chandler is sitting on the sofa. Joey enters.)
31	Joey	 Hey!
32	Chandler	 Hey!
33	Joey	 What's going on?
34	Chandler	 Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
35	Monica	 (sarcastically) We?
36	Chandler	 You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
37	Joey	 Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
38	Chandler	 Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
39	Monica	 And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
40	Joey	 Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
41	Chandler	 (pointing at himself) Little people?
42	Joey	 (pointing at himself) Celebrity.
43	Monica	 Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
44	Chandler	 What...? NO!
45	Monica	 Chandler?
46	Chandler	 (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
47	Monica	 Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
48	Chandler	 I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
49	Monica	 It isn't mine!
50	Joey	 (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
51		
52	[Scene	 The New York City Children's fund hallway.]
53	Charity guy	 May I help you?
54	Phoebe	 Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
55	Charity guy	 Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
56	Phoebe	 Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
57	Charity guy	 Well, this is very generous!
58	Phoebe	 And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
59	Mike	 Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
60	Phoebe	 Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
61	Charity guy	 Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
62	Mike	 Not necessary.
63	Phoebe	 Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
64	Mike	 And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
65	Charity guy	 Right. Well, on behalf of the children
66	Phoebe	 Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
67	Mike	 It does. It feels really good!
68	Phoebe	 Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
69	Charity guy	 Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
70	Phoebe	 Mhm... it's moist.
71		
72	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment.]
73	Ross	 (he enters) Hi!
74	Rachel	 Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
75	Ross	 Oh, good!
76	Rachel	 Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
77	Ross	 Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
78	Rachel	 Absolutely.
79	Ross	 There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
80	Rachel	 So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
81	Ross	 Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
82	Rachel	 Oh my God, what!?
83	Ross	 Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
84	Rachel	 Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
85	Ross	 Be-caaauuuse...
86	Rachel	 (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
87	Ross	 Seriously?
88	Rachel	 Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
89	Ross	 (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
90	Rachel	 Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
91	Ross	 Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
92	Rachel	 Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
93	Ross	 Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.
94	Rachel	 All right!
95	Ross	 Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
96	Rachel	 Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
97	Ross	 Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
98	[Scene	 Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door]
99	Monica	 Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
100	Chandler	 Ok, ok, here we go.
101	Monica	 Ok.
102	Chandler	 Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
103	Phoebe	 Hello, is this the creepy residence?
104	Monica	 We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
105	Phoebe	 Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
106	Monica	 I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
107	Phoebe	 No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
108	Monica	 That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
109	Phoebe	 We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
110	Monica	 That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
111	Phoebe	 City Hall.
112	Monica	 Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
113	Phoebe	 It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
114	Monica	 Yay!
115	Chandler	 But you already gave all your money to charity!
116	Phoebe	 Well, I’ll just ask for it back!
117	Chandler	 I don’t think you can do that!
118	Monica	 Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
119	Chandler	 That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
120	[Scene	 The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they’re ready to play]
121	Rachel	 Ok, careful.
122	Ross	 Ok.
123	Rachel	 Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
124	Ross	 Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
125	Rachel	 I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
126	Ross	 I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
127	Rachel	 Ok.
128	Ross (to Emma)	 Ready sweety?
129	Rachel	 Ok.
130	Ross	 Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
131	Rachel	 Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
132	Ross	 See, I told you!
133	Rachel	 Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
134	Ross	 Oh, absolutely!
135	Rachel	 Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.
136	Ross	 Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!
137		
138	[Scene	 The New York City Children's fund ]
139	Mike	 We’re seriously asking for our money back?
140	Phoebe	 It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
141	Charity guy	 Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t think that that’s ever happened before.
142	Phoebe (to Mike)	 Gay, go.
143	Mike (to the charity guy)	 Oh my God, I love your shirt!
144	Phoebe	 The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.
145	Charity guy	 Excuse me?
146	Phoebe	 Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.
147	Charity guy	 So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?
148	Mike	 Yeah! This feels really good.
149	Phoebe	 I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
150	Charity guy	 Hey, it’s not my business, (he takes their check from a drawer) besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…
151	Phoebe	 Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)
152	Mike	 She could have been talking about either one of us.
153		
154	[Scene	 Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door]
155	Laura	 Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
156	Monica	 Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
157	Laura	 Thank you!
158	Monica	 Would you like something to drink?
159	Laura	 Oh, water would be fine.
160	Monica	 Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
161	Chandler	 Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
162	Laura	 Your place is just lovely.
163	Monica	 Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
164	Laura	 You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
165	Monica	 Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)
166	Chandler	 But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
167	Laura	 Oh...
168	Chandler	 What?
169	Laura	 I just realized why I remember this place.
170	Monica	 Really? What is it?
171	Laura	 Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
172	Monica	 Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
173	Laura	 Yes!
174	Chandler	 Of course it was!
175	Laura	 Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
176	Chandler	 RAT BASTARD!
177	Laura	 So you're not friends with him?
178	Monica and Chandler	 OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!
179	Laura	 Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child... (someone knocks on the door)
180	Joey	 (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it back in his face) OW!
181	Laura	 What was that?
182	Chandler	 Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
183		
184	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel are at the playground with Emma. Rachel in putting her back in the stroller and Ross is tending to his wound]
185	Rachel	 Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
186	Ross	 SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) (To the kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)
187	Rachel	 Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
188	Ross	 No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
189	Rachel	 Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
190	Ross	 No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
191	Rachel	 (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
192	Ross	 Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
193	Rachel	 Alright fine. I'll do it.
194	Ross	 Good.
195	Rachel	 If you hold a spider.
196	Ross	 (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
197	Rachel	 IF you hold a spider.
198	Ross	 I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again, afraid)
199	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler is still leaning against the door, keeping Joey out, who is still banging and shouting on the other side.]
200	Joey	 Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
201	Chandler	 (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
202	Laura	 What's going on?
203	Chandler	 Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on the door again)
204	Joey	 Guys!?
205	Monica	 Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
206	Joey	 What's going on?
207	Chandler	 WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
208		(cut to Joey on the other side, who finally leaves the door and goes to his apartment)
209	Joey	 Everything doesn't sound fine!
210	Laura	 Is he alright out there by himself?
211	Chandler	 Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
212	Laura	 Bert and Ernie!
213	Chandler	 (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
214	[Scene	 Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike enter]
215	Mike	 You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
216	Phoebe	 (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
217	Mike	 Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
218	Phoebe	 Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.
219	Mike	 No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
220	Phoebe	 Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
221	Mike	 Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
222	Phoebe	 And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
223		
224	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.
225	Laura	 Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.
226	Monica	 Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
227	Laura	 Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here...
228		(She starts checking her form. Chandler sees movement near the window from the corner of his eye and when he looks he spots Joey climbing up the fire escape and onto their balcony. He warns Monica silently.)
229	Monica	 (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?
230		(Joey enters through the side window and jogs towards the kitchen holding a baseball bat)
231	Chandler	 What the hell are you doing?
232	Joey	 Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
233	Chandler	 Well, we're not.
234	Joey	 But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
235	Chandler	 We don't have a code word.
236	Joey	 We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
237		(Monica talks loudly in the baby's room)
238	Monica	 So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)
239	Monica	 (To Chandler) What room should we see next?
240	Chandler	 Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
241	Monica	 (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).
242		(Joey gets up and look annoyed)
243	Joey	 (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!
244	Chandler	 (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
245	Joey	 Ok, ok! (He leaves)
246	Chandler	 Ok!
247		(Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler walks towards the living room, but then Joey enters again.)
248	Chandler	 What?
249	Joey	 I forgot my bat.
250		(He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes...)
251	Laura	 Oh my God!
252	Chandler	 And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
253	Laura	 What are you doing here?
254	Joey	 (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
255	Laura	 Are you friends with him?
256	Chandler	 I can explain... Joey...
257	Joey	 Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
258	Laura	 Excuse me?
259	Joey	 Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
260	Laura	 I gave you my number, you never called me.
261	Joey	 No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
262	Laura	 (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
263	Joey	 Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
264	Laura	 I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
265	Joey	 No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)
266	Laura	 Joey, wait!
267	Joey	 (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)
268	Laura	 (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
269	Chandler	 Oh, that's really ok.
270	Monica	 Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
271	Laura	 Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.
272		(Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey enters the apartment again.)
273	Joey	 LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)
274		
275	[Scene	 The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and Mike are entering.]
276	Phoebe	 (to the Charity guy) We're back!
277	Charity guy	 Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
278	Mike	 No, no, we're here to give the money back.
279	Phoebe	 Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
280		(the Charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but Phoebe pulls it back again. His smile fades.)
281	Phoebe	 Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
282	Charity guy	 If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe) congratulations!
283	Mike	 (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do?
284	Charity guy	 You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
285	Mike	 What?
286	Charity guy	 On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
287	Phoebe	 But... but... but we're giving you this!
288	Charity guy	 Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe)
289	Phoebe	 (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!
290	Charity guy	 Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
291	Mike	 Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
292	Charity guy	 Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
293	Phoebe	 Oh, is that you?
294	Charity guy	 No!
295		
296	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in their living room when the phone rings.]
297	Monica	 Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)
298	Chandler	 Wrong number?
299	Monica	 It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
300	Chandler	 That's great!
301	Monica	 Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
302		(Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again... Monica's eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.)
303	Chandler	 Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
304		COMMERCIAL BREAK
305	[Scene	 The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there. Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.]
306	Rachel	 Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
307	Ross	 (nervously) Ok...
308	Rachel	 Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
309	Ross	 (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
310	Rachel	 (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
311		(She slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.)
312	Rachel	 (more confident) Ok...
313		(She slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed...)
314	Rachel	 whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
315	Ross	 See?
316	Rachel	 A-alright! I can do this.
317	Ross	 There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
318	Rachel	 That's because he's on your neck.
