2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the entire gang is there, eating breakfast. Phoebe is on the couch, fidgeting.]
3	Phoebe	 What am I sitting on?
4	Chandler	 Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.
5	Phoebe	 (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!
6		(She throws them into the kitchen and Rachel picks them up with the handle of a large spoon. Chandler and Monica have horrified looks on their faces.)
7	Rachel	 All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
8	Ross	 Well, they're not mine!
9	Chandler	 Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
10		(Rachel turns and stares at him.)
11	Joey	 Yeah, they're mine.
12	Chandler	 See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
13	Ross	 Why are they here?
14	Joey	 I don't know uhh… (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
15	Rachel	 Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
16	Chandler	 Yeah!
17	Monica	 Yeah!
18	Rachel	 (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
19	Joey	 (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.
20		(Follows Joey into their apartment and shrugs on his way out.)
21		[Cut to the guy's apartment.]
22	Joey	 That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! (Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
23	Monica	 (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
24	Joey	 Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
25	Monica	 (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
26	Joey	 Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't…
27	Chandler	 (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
28	Joey	 Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
29	Chandler	 Well, yeah actually.
30	Monica	 We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
31	Chandler	 I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
32	Monica	 We are! Help us!
33	Chandler	 Help!
34	Joey	 All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.
35	Monica	 Joey!
36	Joey	 Didn't think so.
37		Opening Credits
38	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters with her nose stuck in a book.]
39	Monica	 Hey, Phoebe!
40	Chandler	 Hi, Pheebs!
41	Rachel	 Hey, Pheebs!
42	Joey	 Hey, Pheebs!
43	Rachel	 What are you reading?
44	Phoebe	 Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
45	Chandler	 I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
46	Phoebe	 Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
47	Rachel	 Honey that sounds like fun.
48	Phoebe	 Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
49	Rachel	 Okay.
50	Phoebe	 Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
51	Rachel	 Oh, I read that in high school.
52	Phoebe	 This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
53	Ross	 (entering, depressed) Hi.
54	Joey	 What's wrong buddy?
55	Ross	 Someone at work ate my sandwich!
56	Chandler	 Well, what did the police say?
57	Ross	 My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
58	Chandler	 Ross, it's just a sandwich!
59	Ross	 Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
60	Monica	 Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)
61	Ross	 (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
62		(Shows the note to Chandler who reads it aloud.)
63	Chandler	 (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
64	Joey	 I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
65	Phoebe	 Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
66	Ross	 Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
67	Chandler	 Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
68	Phoebe	 Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)
69	All	 Whoa! Ohh!!
70	Monica	 Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
71	Phoebe	 Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
72	Monica	 Phoebe?
73	Phoebe	 Well, he stabbed me first!!
74	[Scene	 Phoebe's class, the class has already started and Rachel walks in late.]
75	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
76	Phoebe	 Okay.
77	Rachel	 So Pheebs, what is the book about?
78	Phoebe	 I thought you said you read it in high school.
79	Rachel	 Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?
80	Phoebe	 Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
81	The Teacher	 How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?
82	Rachel	 Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
83	The Teacher	 Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
84	Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
85	The Teacher	 Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…
86	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
87	Rachel	 Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
88	Phoebe	 Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
89	The Teacher	 What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
90	Phoebe	 I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
91	The Teacher	 Would ya care to venture one?
92	Phoebe	 Would you care to venture one?
93	The Teacher	 Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
94	Phoebe	 Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
95	The Teacher	 All right, let's move on.
96	Phoebe	 Okay then.
97	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel return from the class.]
98	Phoebe	 Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
99	Rachel	 Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
100	Ross	 (entering) Phoebe!
101	Phoebe	 Yeah?
102	Ross	 Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
103	Monica	 Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
104	Ross	 That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
105		(Joey casually pushes Ross over the back of the couch and sits down proud of himself.)
106	[Scene	 The hallway, Joey is returning from a date with Cynthia.]
107	Cynthia	 God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
108	Joey	 So you uh, still wondering?
109	Cynthia	 No, we just went out.
110	Joey	 You're smart. I like that.
111		(He goes to open the door to his apartment, but finds it locked. As he's getting out his keys, Chandler and Monica quickly jump up from making out in the living room and run to Chandler's bedroom. The apartment has about 20 candles burning all over the place. Joey opens the door and ushers Cynthia in.)
112	Cynthia	 Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)
113	Joey	 Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
114	Cynthia	 I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)
115	Joey	 Hiya.
116	Rachel	 Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna… (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)
117	Chandler	 What is going on here?
118	Rachel	 And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
119		(Chandler silently pleads with Joey to cover for them.)
120	Joey	 I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)
121		Commercial Break
122	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's; continued from earlier. Joey is closing the door after Rachel leaves and is about to confront Chandler and Monica.]
123	Joey	 You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
124	Monica	 We're so sorry.
125	Chandler	 Yeah.
126	Joey	 Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
127	Chandler	 No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
128	Joey	 Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
129	Chandler	 Oh—I don't know.
130	Joey	 Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
131	Monica	 Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
132	Joey	 All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
133	[Scene	 The Museum of Prehistoric History (Ross's work); Ross is in the break room eating lunch as his boss, Dr. Leedbetter walks in.]
134	Dr. Leedbetter	 Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
135	Ross	 Yeah, of course, Donald.
136	Dr. Leedbetter	 We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
137	Ross	 What?!
138	Dr. Leedbetter	 Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
139	Ross	 (Proudly) Yeah.
140	Dr. Leedbetter	 We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
141	Ross	 Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
142	Dr. Leedbetter	 (laughs) A sandwich?
143	Ross	 Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
144	Dr. Leedbetter	 (laughs) Oh, you know what?
145	Ross	 What?
146	Dr. Leedbetter	 I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
147	Ross	 You ate my sandwich?
148	Dr. Leedbetter	 It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
149	Ross	 (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
150	Dr. Leedbetter	 No.
151	Ross	 Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
152	Dr. Leedbetter	 There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
153	Ross	 (getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
154	Dr. Leedbetter	 Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
155	Ross	 (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
156	Dr. Leedbetter	 Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
157	Ross	 You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
158		[Cut to an outside shot of the museum.]
159	Ross	 (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
160		[Cut to a shot of a park.]
161	Ross	 MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
162	[Scene	 Phoebe and Rachel's class; Rachel walks in, on time this time.]
163	Rachel	 Hi!
164	Phoebe	 Hi!
165	Rachel	 (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?
166	Phoebe	 You didn't read this one either?!
167	Rachel	 Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
168	Phoebe	 What?
169	Rachel	 Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
170	Phoebe	 No! You should've read it yourself!
171	Rachel	 Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!
172	Phoebe	 Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
173	Rachel	 A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
174	Phoebe	 Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
175	The Teacher	 (entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
176	Phoebe	 Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
177	The Teacher	 Well, go ahead Rachel.
178	Rachel	 Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
179	The Teacher	 If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
180	Rachel	 Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
181	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch as Monica joins him.]
182	Chandler	 Hey.
183	Monica	 Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)
184	Chandler	 (gasps) You're naked in this picture!
185	Monica	 I know.
186		(Ross walks in, eating cotton candy. Monica nudges Chandler who hides the picture in his magazine. Ross sits down on the chair, he seems kinda out of it.)
187	Chandler	 Ross?
188	Ross	 (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
189	Monica	 Ross, are you okay?
190	Ross	 I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
191	Monica	 Why?!
192	Ross	 On account of my rage.
193	Chandler	 Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
194	Ross	 He gave me a pill for it.
195	Monica	 A pill?
196	Ross	 Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
197	Monica	 Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
198	Chandler	 And you're okay with that?
199	Ross	 I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
200	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are returning from class.]
201	Rachel	 (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
202	Phoebe	 (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
203	Rachel	 That was not funny!
204	Phoebe	 Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
205	Rachel	 Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
206	Phoebe	 Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
207	Rachel	 Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
208	[Scene	 The Class; Monica has taken Rachel's spot.]
209	Monica	 (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!
210	The Teacher	 Monica, you asked the question.
211		(She sits back defeated, and Phoebe groans with disgust.)
212	[Scene	 Chandler, Joey, and Ross's; Joey returns carrying a bucket of chicken, and starts going through the mail. While doing this, Monica's picture falls out. He bends over to pick it up and gasps. While he's staring at the picture, Rachel decides to come over and sees him looking at the picture.]
213	Rachel	 (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!
214	Joey	 Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
215	Rachel	 You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
216	Ross	 (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?
217	Rachel	 Joey has got a secret peephole!
218	Chandler	 (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
219	Rachel	 Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
220		(Ross stares in shock at him as he angrily puts down the chicken and takes off his coat.)
221	Rachel	 Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)
222	Ross	 (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)
223	Monica	 (grabbing the picture) Give me that!
224	Phoebe	 All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
225	Joey	 No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… Kinda…
226	Chandler	 All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
227		(He walks over and stands behind Joey.)
228	Joey	 Thank you!
229	Chandler	 Joey's a sex addict.
230	Joey	 What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!
231	Monica	 It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
232	Joey	 No! No! I am not a sex addict!
233	Monica	 Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
234	Joey	 No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
235	Rachel	 Well, what is the truth?
236	Ross	 Yeah, what's going on?
237	Phoebe	 What's going on?
238	Joey	 (thinking) I slept with Monica.
239	Chandler	 Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
240	Monica	 Oh no!
241	Ross	 You slept with my sister?
242	Joey	 Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
243	Ross	 This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
244	Rachel	 Monica, is this true?
245	Joey	 Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
246	Monica	 Yes it's true.
247	Rachel	 Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
248	Joey	 Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
249	Monica	 I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.
250	Ross	 My God Monica!!
251	Chandler	 Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
252	Joey	 No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
253	Phoebe	 So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
254	Joey	 That makes sense!
255	Rachel	 And the video camera?
256	Joey	 Uhh, Monica?
257	Monica	 I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
258	Joey	 But sadly I could not be enticed.
259	Ross	 Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
260	Monica	 I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
261	Joey	 Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)
262		Ending Credits
263	[Scene	 Monica and Phoebe's class; the class has ended and Phoebe is talking to one of her classmates.]
264	Phoebe	 I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
265	A Female Student	 Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
266	Phoebe	 I don't know! I didn't come with her!
267	Monica	 (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
268	All	 A test?!!
269	Monica	 Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We should have essay questions!!
