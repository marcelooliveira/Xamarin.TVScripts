3	Joey	 Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
4	Monica	 Um-mm.
5	Joey	 All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.
6		(Monica is sarcastically amazed.)
7	Ross	 Real magic does exist.
8	Rachel	 Wow.
9	Monica	 Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
10	Joey	 I can’t tell you that, no.
11		(We hear some knocking coming from the ceiling.)
12	Ross	 Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.
13	Rachel	 Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
14	Monica	 He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
15	Phoebe	 Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’
16	Monica	 I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
17	Phoebe	 Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.
18	Monica	 All right, be my guest.
19	Rachel	 Good luck.
20		(Phoebe exits)
21	Joey	 All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)
22	All	 Oh, I got it.
23		(We hear Phoebe knock at the door upstairs, and the guy answer it.)
24	Phoebe	 (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).
25	Guy	 (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.
26	Phoebe	 (muffled) Oh, thank you.
27		Opening Credits
28	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
29	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
30	Monica	 Honey, what’s the matter?
31	Chandler	 I just saw Janice.
32	All	 Oh.
33	Chandler	 Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
34	Joey	 Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
35	Chandler	 Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
36	Joey	 Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
37	Ross	 Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.
38	Chandler	 Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.
39	Monica	 It’s Joey’s birthday.
40	Chandler	 Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
41		(We hear Phoebe’s muffled voice through the ceiling.)
42	Monica	 Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
43		(We hear the guy telling a joke, and Phoebe laughing.)
44	Chandler	 Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
45	[Scene	 Fortunata Fashions, Rachel’s new job.]
46	Mr. Kaplan	 (entering) How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?
47	Rachel	 (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
48	Mr. Kaplan	 I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
49	Rachel	 I know!
50	Mr. Kaplan	 I’ll bet your thinking, ‘What’s an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?’ Eh?
51	Rachel	 Op.
52	Mr. Kaplan	 Eh.
53	Rachel	 Oh, you got me.
54	Mr. Kaplan	 Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential. Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
55	Rachel	 Oh, that sounds great.
56	Mr. Kaplan	 Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)
57	Rachel	 Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
58	Mr. Kaplan	 (opening the closet door revealing that it’s full of tangled up hangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) You’re welcome.
59	[Scene	 The Moondance Diner, Rachel is talking to Monica about her job.]
60	Rachel	 Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
61	Monica	 I know honey, I’m sorry.
62	Rachel	 Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.
63	Monica	 (gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
64	Rachel	 Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
65		(A guy at the end of the table starts laughing.)
66	Rachel	 (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
67	Guy	 I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)
68	Rachel	 It’s not funny, this is actually my job.
69	Guy	 Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
70	Rachel	 Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
71	Guy	 Ah, just one other thing.
72	Rachel	 Yes?!
73	Guy	 I ah, I work at Bloomingdale’s and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
74	Rachel	 (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
75	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, it’s Joey’s party.]
76	Gunther	 (to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.
77	Monica	 Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
78	Phoebe	 Well, he’s very charming.
79	Monica	 I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
80	Phoebe	 Well, you’re just gonna have to try.
81	Monica	 Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
82	Joey	 I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...
83		(Camera cuts to show Chandler giving a Jello shot to the ceramic dog and holding an empty tray of Jello shots.)
84	Joey	 Chandler!
85	Chandler	 Hello-dillillio!!
86	Ross	 Oh, somebody’s feeling better.
87	Monica	 (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
88	Chandler	 (to Monica) Take off your shirt!
89		(Chandler sticks out is tongue and it’s a horrible shade of green.)
90	Monica	 Oh my!!
91	Joey	 Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
92	Chandler	 Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
93	Rachel	 (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
94	Ross	 Hi!
95	Rachel	 Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
96	Ross	 Wow!
97	Rachel	 I know!
98	Ross	 What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
99	Rachel	 Uh-huh!
100	Ross	 And he’s, he’s a total stranger?
101	Rachel	 Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
102	Ross	 Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
103	Rachel	 What!?
104	Ross	 Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
105	Rachel	 To be nice.
106	Ross	 Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
107	Joey	 No, only for sex.
108	Ross	 Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
109	Rachel	 I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.
110	Ross	 Uh-huh.
111	Joey’s Sisters	 (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look almost identical)
112	Joey	 Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
113	Chandler	 (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
114	Monica	 How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.
115	Chandler	 Hi Joey’s sisters!
116	Phoebe	 (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!
117	Cookie	 Hey. What are we drinkin’ over here.
118	Phoebe	 Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
119	Cookie	 No kiddin,’ that’s the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
120	Phoebe	 Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.
121		(Cut to Chandler)
122	Sister 1	 (to Chandler) What ‘cha doing?
123	Chandler	 Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
124	Joey’s Sisters	 Oh!!
125	Chandler	 No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
126		(Cut to Ross and Monica)
127	Ross	 Hi.
128	Monica	 Hi.
129	Ross	 Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
130	Monica	 Isn’t that great?
131	Ross	 Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
132	Monica	 Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)
133	Ross	 That’s excellent.
134	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
135	Ross	 (to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?
136	Rachel	 Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.
137		(Chandler enters hungover and groaning)
138	Monica	 How ya feelin’?
139	Chandler	 Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.
140	Phoebe	 Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
141	Ross	 Yeah.
142	Chandler	 Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
143	All	 Woooo hoooo!!!
144	Chandler	 Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
145	Phoebe	 Why, what happened?
146	Chandler	 Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that’s not the worst part.
147	Monica	 What is the worse part?
148	Chandler	 I can’t remember which sister.
149	Ross	 (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!
150		Commercial Break
151	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
152	Monica	 Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.
153	Chandler	 Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
154	Phoebe	 How can you not know which one?
155	Rachel	 I mean that’s unbelievable.
156	Monica	 I mean, was it Gina?
157	Ross	 Which one is Gina?
158	Rachel	 Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
159	Monica	 No, no, no, that’s Dina.
160	Chandler	 (to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!
161	Phoebe	 We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
162	Chandler	 Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
163	Monica	 That was me.
164	Chandler	 Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.
165	Monica	 That’s okay.
166	Rachel	 That’s all right.
167	Ross	 That’s okay.
168	Joey	 (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!
169	Ross	 Hey, Joey.
170	Rachel	 Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)
171	Joey	 Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
172	Chandler	 Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
173	Joey	 I just got off the phone with my sister.
174	Ross	 Ah, which, which one?
175	Joey	 Mary-Angela.
176	Ross	 Mary-Angela.
177	Joey	 Yeah.
178	Monica	 Y'know which one was she again?
179	Joey	 Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.
180	Chandler	 It’s gotta be the first one.
181	Joey	 Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.
182	Chandler	 Yep, I’m in a tree.
183	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is writing letters as Rachel enters.]
184	Rachel	 Did he call? Did Mark call?
185	Monica	 No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.
186	Rachel	 Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
187	Monica	 I guess they’re back from their date.
188		(He starts to play music.)
189	Rachel	 Music. Very nice.
190		(We hear them start making out upstairs.)
191	Monica	 Oh my God!
192	Rachel	 So, how are you?
193	Monica	 I am good. I finished my book.
194		(Things start to get really hot upstairs.)
195	Rachel	 Oh yeah, what’s it about?
196	Monica	 I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
197	Rachel	 Yeah, I do. (they both run out)
198	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Ross is reading a letter that Chandler wrote.]
199	Ross	 Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
200	Chandler	 Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
201	Ross	 All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
202	Chandler	 What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
203	Ross	 Where in Cuba?
204	[Scene	 Joey’s sister’s house, Chandler hits himself on the head three times and knocks on the door three times. Joey answers it.]
205	Chandler	 (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
206	Joey	 Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
207	Chandler	 I’m here to see Mary-Angela.
208	Joey	 You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
209	Chandler	 Where’s Mary-Angela?
210	Joey	 She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)
211		(Chandler walks into the living room, and sees all of Joey’s sisters, all wearing red.)
212	Joey’s Sisters	 Hey, Chandler!
213	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
214	Rachel	 I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.
215	Ross	 Bummer.
216	Rachel	 (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.
217	Ross	 No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
218	Monica	 Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.
219	Ross	 But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.
220	Monica	 (to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.
221	Ross	 (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
222	Rachel	 Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
223	Ross	 That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)
224	Rachel	 (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
225	Ross	 That is so made up!
226	Rachel	 (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!
227	Monica	 Yay!
228	Ross	 There you go.
229	Rachel	 He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
230	Monica	 Oh, that is amazing!
231	Ross	 Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.
232	Rachel	 I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.
233	Ross	 High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
234	Rachel	 Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!
235	Ross	 You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
236	Monica	 What?
237	Ross	 ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
238	Monica	 Are you crazy?!
239	Ross	 Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
240	Monica	 What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
241	Ross	 No.
242	Monica	 I mean don’t you trust her?
243	Ross	 Well, yeah!
244	Monica	 Then get over yourself! Grow up!
245	Ross	 (shyly) You grow up.
246	[Scene	 Joey’s sister’s house, they’re finishing up dinner.]
247	Chandler	 This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
248	Joey’s Grandmother	 No! I did!
249	Chandler	 Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
250	Joey’s Grandmother	 Of course! It’s her favorite.
251	Chandler	 So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?
252	Joey’s Grandmother	 More of Grandma’s teramisu.
253	Chandler	 Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.
254	Joey’s Grandmother	 That dies with me.
255	Chandler	 So will I.
256	Joey’s Sister	 Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
257	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.
258	Joey’s Sister	 (whispering in his ear) Just do it.
259	Chandler	 Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
260		[Cut to the hall, Joey’s sister runs up and grabs Chandler’s butt.]
261	Chandler	 (startled) Hey!
262	Joey’s Sister	 Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)
263	Chandler	 Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
264	Joey’s Sister	 So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
265	Chandler	 Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.
266	Joey’s Sister	 No, I’m Mary-Theresa.
267	Chandler	 This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
268	Mary-Angela	 (standing behind Chandler) I am!
269	Chandler	 Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)
270	Mary-Angela	 Joey!!!
271	Chandler	 No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!
272	Joey	 What’s goin’ on?
273	Chandler	 (pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!
274	Mary-Theresa	 It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
275	Joey	 What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
276	Chandler	 I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
277	Joey’s Sister	 I say, punch him Joey.
278	All	 Yeah! Punch him!!
279	Chandler	 Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
280	Joey	 Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
281	Chandler	 Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
282	Cookie	 So what. I say, punch him.
283	All	 Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
284	Joey	 No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.
285	Cookie	 I’ll do it.
286	Joey	 No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
287	Chandler	 Okay, absolutely!
288	Joey	 All right.
289	Chandler	 You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)
290	Joey	 Cookie, now you can punch him!
291	Chandler	 What?! (Cookie punches him)
292	[Scene	 A lobby, Ross is waiting for Rachel, after her interview.]
293	Rachel	 (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!
294	Ross	 Hi!
295	Rachel	 What are you doing here?
296	Ross	 Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)
297	Rachel	 Oh.
298	Ross	 Hi. (kisses her)
299	Rachel	 Hi.
300	Ross	 How’d did it go?
301	Rachel	 Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.
302	Ross	 I’m so proud of you.
303	Rachel	 Me too!
304	Ross	 Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...
305	Rachel	 I know.
306	Ross	 Yeah.

308	Mark	 Rachel?
309	Rachel	 Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!
310	Mark	 Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
311	Rachel	 Oh, I did!
312	Mark	 Yes.
313	Rachel	 (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)
314	Ross	 Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.

317	Monica	 So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
318	Phoebe	 Oh well y'know. (laughs)
319	Monica	 Yeah, I do know.
320	Phoebe	 Ick, you were eavesdropping.
321	Rachel	 Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
322	Phoebe	 Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
323		(We hear the sound of a bed creaking through the ceiling, and him moaning.)
324	Ross	 Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
325		(We hear a women start moaning.)
326	Ross	 Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
327	Joey	 All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel) But, is he a big guy?
328	Ross	 Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)
329	Phoebe	 Thanks you guys! Thank you.
330	Chandler	 Don’t worry.
331	Phoebe	 God, I hope they kick his ass!
332	Rachel	 Honey, I’m sorry.
333	Monica	 Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)
