2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, everyone except Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a magazine.]
3	Rachel	 Hi!
4	Ross	 Hey!
5	Monica	 Hey!
6	Rachel	 So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to Joey.)
7	Joey	 (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!
8	Monica	 How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! (She has her hand on his shoulder.)
9	Joey	 Yeah you are baby.
10	Monica	 Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?
11	Rachel	 So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
12	Joey	 No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
13	Ross	 Why’d you say no?
14	Joey	 Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
15	Chandler	 If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
16	Rachel	 Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?
17	Chandler	 Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
18	Rachel	 Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?
19	Joey	 Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.
20	Ross	 Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
21	Rachel	 Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.
22	Joey	 Yeah.
23		Opening Credits
24	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is there for his interview and everyone but Phoebe are hiding on the couch.]
25	The Interviewer	 I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
26	Joey	 Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
27		[Cut to the rest of the gang sitting low on the couch and craning their necks to watch the interview.]
28	Monica	 (To Chandler) You think we’re being obvious?
29	Chandler	 No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)
30		[Cut to the interview.]
31	The Interviewer	 (To Joey) Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
32	Joey	 (laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
33	Gunther	 Can I get you anything?
34	The Interviewer	 Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.
35	Joey	 And I’ll have all the muffins.
36		[Cut to the gang.]
37	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
38	Ross	 Shhh! We’re not talking.
39	Phoebe	 Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
40		[Cut to the interview.]
41	The Interviewer	 So, according to your bio, you’ve done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you’re particularly proud of?
42	[This starts a series of flashbacks; the first one is from Episode 106	 The One With The Butt, Joey is in a play called Freud!.]
43	Joey	 (He goes into a song and dance number)
44		All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
45	[The next one is from Episode 304	 The One With The Metaphorical Tunnel, Joey is on Amazing Discoveries.]
46	Host	 Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
47	Joey	 Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
48	Mike	 And there is Kevin.
49		[Cut forward.]
50	Mike	 This is the first time he’s ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (To Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.
51	Joey	 (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
52		(The crowd ahhs.)
53	[The next one is from Episode 322	 The One With The Screamer, it’s the end of Joey’s play.]
54	Lauren	 So this is it? Victor?
55	Joey	 Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.
56		(The ladder retracts, taking Joey up into the spaceship for his voyage to Blargon 7.)
57	[The next one is from Episode 204	 The One With Phoebe’s Husband, when everyone including Julie is watching Joey in his porno.]
58	Joey	 Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad for the paper tray.
59	Chandler	 Nice work my friend.
60	Joey	 Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…
61		[Cut to the interview.]
62	Joey	 Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.
63		[Cut to the gang.]
64	Phoebe	 I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
65	Rachel	 Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
66	Ross	 Uh, double latte, extra foam.
67	Chandler	 And a bagel with only…
68	Phoebe	 (interrupting him) I was just being polite!
69		[Cut to the interview.]
70	The Interviewer	 Okay, how about when you’re not working. What do you do in your spare time?
71	[This starts another series of flashbacks about Joey’s hobbies. The first one is from Episode 703	 The One With Phoebe’s Cookies, Rachel is teaching Joey how to sail his boat, the Mr. Bowmont.]
72	Joey	 (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
73	Rachel	 That is the Coast Guard.
74	Joey	 What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. (Points to the coast.)
75	[The next one is from Episode 603	 The One With Ross’s Denial, Joey is amazing Phoebe and Monica by holding his breath.]
76	Chandler	 (entering) Hey!
77	Phoebe	 Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
78		(We see Joey who has puffed up his cheeks and Chandler nonchalantly reaches down and pinches Joey’s nose shut. In a few seconds, Joey has to move because he’s now forced to actually hold his breath.)
79	Joey	 (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
80	[The next one is from Episode 507	 The One Where Ross Moves In.]
81	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Chandler is entering and when he closes the door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy hat.]
82	Chandler	 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
83	Ross	 (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
84	Chandler	 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
85	Joey	 Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
86		(Chandler does so.)
87	[The next one is from Episode 417	 The One With The Free Porn, Chandler and Joey are lamenting the fact that every beautiful woman they see doesn’t want to have sex right then and there like in porn.]
88	Chandler	 Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
89	Joey	 I think you’re right.
90		(Goes over and picks up the remote.)
91	Chandler	 All right, ready?
92	Joey	 One.
93	Chandler	 Two.
94	Both	 Three.
95		(Chandler turns off the porn and sets the remote down.)
96	Joey	 That’s kinda nice.
97	Chandler	 Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.
98	Joey	 Yeah.
99		(Pause.)
100	Chandler	 You wanna see if we still have it?
101	Joey	 Yeah.
102		(Chandler turns on the TV and…)
103	Chandler	 FREE PORN!!!
104	Joey	 Yeah!!
105	Chandler	 We have free porn here!!!
106		[Cut to the interview.]
107	Joey	 In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)
108	The Interviewer	 A mento…
109	Joey	 Right.
110	The Interviewer	 Like the candy?
111	Joey	 Matter of fact, I do.
112		(Chandler tries to jump over the couch but everyone stops him.)
113	The Interviewer	 Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
114	Joey	 Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
115	[Another set of flashbacks begin with Episode 521	 The One With The Ball, Joey and Ross are throwing a ball around.]
116	Joey	 Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
117	Ross	 Are you serious?!
118	Joey	 Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
119	Ross	 Wow! We are pretty good at this!
120	Joey	 Yeah!
121	Ross	 Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
122	Joey	 Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
123	[The next one is from Episode 604	 The One Where Joey Loses His Insurance.]
124	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Chandler enters to find Joey lying in the fetus position on the floor.]
125	Chandler	 What’s wrong with you?
126	Joey	 Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
127	Chandler	 This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!
128	Joey	 No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!
129	[The next one is from Episode 609	 The One Where Ross Got High, Rachel is describing her desert to Joey and Ross.]
130	Rachel	 It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef saut�ed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
131		[Time lapse, Ross and Joey are eating Rachel’s disaster.]
132	Ross	 It tastes like feet!
133	Joey	 I like it.
134	Ross	 Are you kidding?
135	Joey	 What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.

139	Chandler	 That’s still in there?!
140	Joey	 Not anymore.
141	[The next one is from Episode 711	 The One With All the Cheesecakes.]
142	[Scene	 The Hallway, Chandler and Rachel are on their knees with forks trying to salvage what they can of the cheesecake off of the floor.]
143	Rachel	 Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
144	Chandler	 Stick to your side!
145	Rachel	 Hey, come on now!
146		(Joey finishes climbing the stairs and sees them. Chandler and Rachel both stop and look up at him. Joey sits down on the step.)
147	Joey	 (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging in.)
148		[Cut to the interview.]
149	Joey	 Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.
150	Gunther	 Your muffins. (Sets down a huge plate of muffins in front of Joey.)
151	Joey	 I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.
152	The Interviewer	 Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
153	Joey	 It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.
154	The Interviewer	 Understood. So, what’d you say back then?
155	Joey	 Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)
156		Commercial Break
157	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
158	Joey	 You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…
159	Rachel	 (interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.
160	Ross	 (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
161	The Interviewer	 Umm, I’m gonna just go get this warmed up. (She takes her coffee mug up to the counter.)
162	Joey	 Okay.
163	Monica	 Joey! You’re doing great!
164	Ross	 Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
165	Chandler	 Mento?
166	Joey	 No thanks.
167	The Interviewer	 (returning) So, as Joey’s friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
168	Ross	 Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
169	Rachel	 (scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
170	Phoebe	 Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
171	The Interviewer	 Oh! I like that. What’s your name?
172	Phoebe	 Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
173	The Interviewer	 How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
174	Phoebe	 Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!

176	Ross	 Yeah, you too.
177	Rachel	 You too!
178	Chandler	 Thanks.
179	Monica	 Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)
180	The Interviewer	 So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
181	[They gang all lean back to listen better, and this starts another series of flashbacks. The first one is from Episode 214	 The One With The Prom Video, Rachel has just found the bracelet that Joey gave Chandler, which is after he bought one to replace it.]
182	Joey	 How come you have two? Chandler
183	[Scene	 Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are eating spaghetti in the living room while watching TV and Rachel drops some on the floor.]
184	Rachel	 Oh, Joey! Sorry!
185	Joey	 No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
186	Rachel	 Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
187	Joey	 Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
188	Rachel	 Really?
189	Joey	 Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
190	Rachel	 I’ve never lived like this before.
191	Joey	 I know.
192		(Rachel throws some of hers down.)
193	Joey	 All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)
194	[The next one is from Episode 224	 The One With Barry And Mindy’s Wedding, Joey has to kiss a guy in an audition and has been trying to find one to practice with.]
195	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey is reading a script as Ross enters]
196	Ross	 All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).
197	Joey	 Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
198	[The next one is from Episode 512	 The One With Chandler’s Work Laugh, Joey and Phoebe are betting on who will reach the treat the fastest, the chick or the duck.]
199	Joey	 All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
200	Phoebe	 Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
201	Joey	 Judge rules, no violation.
202	Phoebe	 Ohhh.
203	Joey	 And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
204	Phoebe	 (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
205	Joey	 Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
206	Phoebe	 Ohh, tough call.
207	Joey	 Yeah.
208	[The next one is from Episode 401	 The One With The Jellyfish, where Monica, Joey, and Chandler are relating that tragic day they spent on the beach.]
209	Joey	 I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
210	Ross	 Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
211	Phoebe and Rachel	 Ewwww!!
212	Monica	 You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (Looks at Joey.)
213	Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel	 (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
214	Joey	 That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you!
215		[Cut to the interview.]
216	Joey	 Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
217	The Interviewer	 So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
218	Joey	 Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!
219		[Cut to the gang.]
220	Chandler	 It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
221		[Cut to the interview.]
222	The Interviewer	 Now, off the record, you’re not…
223	[Another group of flashbacks begin with Episode 513	 The One With Joey’s Bag. Joey is carrying the bag and has entered Central Perk to the amusement of Ross and Chandler.]
224	Joey	 What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
225	Ross	 Your make-up!
226	[The next one is from Episode 712	 The One Where They’re Up All Night, Joey and Ross are deciding how to climb down the final part of the fire escape.]
227	Ross	 Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
228	Joey	 I think face to face.
229	Ross	 I would say that.
230	Joey	 Face to face, yeah!
231	Ross	 Okay, here I go.
232	Joey	 All right.
233		(Ross steps onto the bottom rung of the ladder and then steps on Joey’s chest.)
234	Joey	 (grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
235	Ross	 I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
236		(Ross continues to climb down. He puts his other foot further down on Joey’s torso, but that doesn’t work very well and he’s forced to wrap his legs around Joey. Which then forces Joey to get a nice and close view of Ross’s crotch.)
237	Joey	 Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
238	[The next one is from Episode 722	 The One With Chandler’s Dad.]
239	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Joey enters strutting.]
240	Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
241	Phoebe	 Hey!
242	Joey	 Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
243	Phoebe	 Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
244	[The next one is from Episode 608	 The One With Ross’s Teeth, Chandler is accusing Joey of becoming less of a man.]
245	Chandler	 You’re turning into a woman.
246	Joey	 No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
247	Chandler	 Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
248	Joey	 It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!
249	[The next one is from Episode 706	 The One With The Nap Partners.]
250	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are napping together again and both wake up at the same time.]
251	Joey	 Great nap.
252	Ross	 It really was.
253		(Suddenly Rachel clears her throat and the camera cuts to the rest of the gang staring at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the gang.)
254		[Cut to the interview.]
255	Joey	 Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. (Chandler and Ross look at each other.)
256	The Interviewer	 So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
257	[Another series of flashbacks begins with Episode 413	 The One With Rachel’s Crush, Joey is telling Rachel and Phoebe how he picks up women.]
258	Joey	 Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"
259	Phoebe	 Oh, please!
260	Joey	 (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?
261		(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)
262	[The next one is from Episode 605	 The One With Joey's Porsche.]
263	[Scene	 The street, Joey is messing with a car cover and still wearing the Porsche stuff. This guy playing street football catches a pass next to the car cover Joey is fooling around with.]
264	Joey	 Hey! How you doin’?
265	Woman	 (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
266	Joey	 I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
267	[The next one is from Episode 613	 The One With Rachel’s Sister, Chandler has just opened the door to reveal a woman standing there.]
268	Woman	 Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister.
269	Rachel	 Oh my God, Jill!
270	Jill	 Oh my God, Rachel!
271		(They run and hug each other.)
272	Chandler	 Oh my God, introduce us!
273	Rachel	 This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
274	Jill	 Hi!
275	Rachel	 And you know Monica and Ross!
276	Ross	 Hi Jill.
277	Rachel	 And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey.
278	Joey	 Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?
279	Rachel	 Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
280	[The final one is from Episode 607	 The One Where Phoebe Runs, Joey has been trying to repel Janice and sees it’s not working to his liking so he’s confronting her about the sexual tension.]
281	Janine	 No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
282	Joey	 Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
283	Janine	 I don't think so.
284	Joey	 Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
285	Janine	 I'm okay.
286	Joey	 What?!?! Oh dear God!
287		[Cut to the interview.]
288	Joey	 Not much to tell there I’m really shy.
289		(The gang is confused.)
290	The Interviewer	 So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
291	Joey	 Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)
292	The Interviewer	 Bye.
293	Joey	 Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) I did it!
294	Rachel	 Yeah!
295	Ross	 Amazing! Amazing!
296	The Interviewer	 (returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what’s your favorite soap opera?
297	Joey	 Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?
298		(The gang is disappointed.)
299	The Interviewer	 Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
300	Joey	 Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!
301		Closing Credits
302	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, everyone is reading Joey’s interview.]
303	Rachel	 Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.
304	Joey	 Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
305	Monica	 You slept with her didn’t you?
306	Joey	 Little bit, yeah.
307	Ross	 Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
308	Joey	 Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base. (Winks at him.)
309	Ross	 Did you just wink at me?
310	Joey	 Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.
