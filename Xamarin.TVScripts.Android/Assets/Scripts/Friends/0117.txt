3	[Scene	 An Emergency Room, Rachel and Monica enter. Rachel is limping and leaning on Monica for support.]
4	Rachel	 Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
5		(They reach the desk. The bored nurse thinks she's heard it all before.)
6	Monica	 Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
7	Nurse	 My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
8		(Rachel glares at the nurse, who gives Monica a form attached to a clipboard.)
9	Nurse	 Fill this out and bring it back to me.
10		(Monica helps Rachel over to a vacant seat.)
11	Rachel	 Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
12		(Monica starts on the form, while Rachel catches her breath and massages her ankle.)
13	Monica	 Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
14	Rachel	 You.
15	Monica	 Really?
16	Rachel	 Yeah.
17	Monica	 Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
18	Rachel	 Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
19	Monica	 (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
20	Rachel	 Why, how much is this gonna cost?
21	Monica	 I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
22	Rachel	 Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
23	Monica	 Well there's not much we can do.
24	Rachel	 (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours.
25	Monica	 Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
26	Rachel	 (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
27	Monica	 (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.
28	Rachel	 Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
29	Monica	 (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.
30	Rachel	 Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
31	Monica	 (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).
32	Nurse	 Why?
33	Monica	 (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine.
34	Nurse	 You are an idiot. (She hands over a blank form).
35	Monica	 (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny laugh).
36	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, has split up his newspaper so Joey can look at the funnies, while Ross's inappropriate joke at Lamaze class has come back to haunt him.]
37	Ross	 I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
38	Chandler and Joey	 That's nice.
39	Ross	 No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
40	Joey	 Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
41	Ross	 Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
42	Chandler	 What are you crazy? That's a baby!
43	Joey	 He should take the sack?
44	Ross	 Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
45	Chandler	 Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
46	Joey	 Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
47		(Feeling a little better, Ross fetches more coffee.)
48	Joey	 Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
49	Chandler	 Well, only if you order stuff.
50	Joey	 I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
51	Ross	 Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
52	Joey	 When's that?
53	Ross	 Tonight.
54	Joey	 Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
55		(Joey begins to contemplate his ill fortune.)
56	Ross	 You take your time.
57		(Joey looks at his friends, thinks a bit more, then realises.)
58	Chandler	 There it is! So what're you gonna do?
59	Joey	 What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
60	Chandler	 And your friend Phoebe?
61	Joey	 Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
62	Chandler	 Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
63		(Joey gestures to show that he wouldn't dare...)
64	[Scene	 The Hospital, Monica and Rachel are waiting for the doctors to arrive. They enter and are played by Noah Wyle and George Clooney.]
65	Dr. Mitchell	 ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
66		(They approach the young ladies. Dr. Mitchell consults Ms.Geller's admissions form.)
67	Dr. Mitchell	 Okay, errrr, Monica?
68	Monica	 Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.
69	Rachel (as Monica)	 Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
70	Monica (as Rachel)	 Hi.
71	Dr. Mitchell	 (Smiling) Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
72	Dr. Rosen	 (Smiling even more and attempting to take over) And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
73		(Monica and Rachel smile back prettily.)
74	Rachel	 Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
75	Dr. Rosen	 Excuse me?
76	Rachel	 I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
77	Monica (as Rachel)	 Thank you.
78	Rachel (as Monica)	 Right.
79	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey is waiting for Phoebe to arrive for her surprise birthday party. Rachel and Monica is telling Chandler about Rachel's incident.]
80	Rachel	 ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
81	Monica	 Uh, you left out the stupid part.
82	Rachel	 Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
83	Monica	 I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
84	Rachel	 What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
85	Chandler	 Alright, what have we learned so far?
86		(There is a knock at the door. Someone turns the music off, then the whole party runs and hides, except for Monica and Rachel who answer their door. Ross stands in the doorway, holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that it's him.)
87	The Whole Party	 (Jumping up) SURPRISE!!!
88		(Ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. The box takes off, then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. Ross is not pleased.)
89	Ross	 What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
90	Rachel	 Was that the cake?
91	Ross	 Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
92	Monica	 Come on, she'll be here any minute.
93		(The whole party gathers round as Ross puts the box on the coffee table.)
94	Rachel	 I hope it's okay.
95		(As Ross opens the lid, everybody looks at the mess inside.)
96	Monica	 Oh...
97	Chandler	 (Reading) "Happy Birthday Peehe."
98	Monica	 Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
99		(Phoebe quietly wanders in, to join the tableau.)
100	Ross	 (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
101	Phoebe	 Hey, what's going on?
102	Ross	 Oh, we just...
103	Phoebe's Friends	 (Finally noticing the guest of honour) Surprise!
104	Phoebe	 (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?
105		(The party falls flat. Chandler tries to think of a witticism, but even he can't help...)
106	Chandler	 Did you see Betty?
107		(Betty waggles her fingers to say "Hi", but Phoebe feels her birthday has been ruined by her twin.)
108	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Ross is having lunch with his father who is examining his next forkful.]
109	Mr. Geller	 I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
110	Ross	 Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
111	Mr. Geller	 I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
112	Ross	 Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
113	Mr. Geller	 No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
114	Ross	 No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
115	Mr. Geller	 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
116	Ross	 Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
117	Mr. Geller	 Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
118		(Ross is so moved by his father's charming story, that he stops eating.)
119	Mr. Geller	 So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
120	Ross	 No, we can go to Williamsburg.
121	Mr. Geller	 Eat your fish.
122	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is just getting off of the intercom and turns off the TV which is still in the SAP mode.]
123	Monica	 Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
124	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Okay, coming!
125		(Monica opens the door for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Geoffrey.)
126	Monica	 Hi, come on in.
127	Dr. Mitchell	 Hey.
128	Monica	 Hi, Geoffrey.
129	Rachel	 Hi.
130	Dr. Rosen	 Ah here, we brought wine.
131	Dr. Mitchell	 Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
132	Rachel	 Oh, that's great. Look at that.
133	Dr. Rosen	 So, Monica, how's the ankle?
134	Monica	 It's uh...
135		(Rachel discreetly coughs to warn her.)
136	Monica (as Rachel)	 ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
137	Rachel (as Monica)	 You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... (They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!
138		(Rachel joins Monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. Rachel checks that the doctors aren't listening, then lowers her voice anyway.)
139	Rachel	 Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
140	Monica	 It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
141	Rachel	 Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
142	Monica	 A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
143		(Back at the couch, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Rosen have concerns of their own.)
144	Dr. Mitchell	 So?
145	Dr. Rosen	 So... they sss-still seem normal.
146	Dr. Mitchell	 That's because they are.
147	Dr. Rosen	 (Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
148	Dr. Mitchell	 Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this. (Dr. Rosen obeys.)
149		(Meanwhile, back at the sink.)
150	Monica	 I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
151	Rachel	 (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
152	Monica	 Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
153	Rachel	 You know what?
154	Monica	 What?
155	Rachel	 You know what?
156	Monica	 What!?
157	Rachel	 You know what?
158	Monica	 (getting angry) What!!?
159	Rachel	 Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
160		(Rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an open-mouthed Monica in her wake.)
161	Rachel	 Hello! Here we go!
162	Dr. Rosen	 This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
163	Rachel	 (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
164	Monica	 (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
165		(Rachel tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair.)
166	Dr. Mitchell	 Really?
167	Monica	 (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
168	Dr. Rosen	 So, Monica, what do you do?
169	Rachel	 (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
170	Dr. Rosen	 Good for you.
171	Rachel	 (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
172	Dr. Rosen	 This hummus is great.
173	Dr. Mitchell	 God bless the chickpea.
174	Monica	 (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
175		(The doctors don't know what to make of all this.)
176	Rachel	 (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
177	Monica	 (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
178	Rachel	 (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
179	Monica	 (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
180		(Rachel lets her anger show too. Hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. The telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. Finally both guys jump up, and Michael wins.)
181	Dr. Mitchell	 (on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
182	Monica	 (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
183		(Monica glares triumphantly across the room, scaring Rachel who also stands up.)
184	Rachel	 Would you excuse me for a second?
185	Monica	 (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
186		(Completely undone by Monica's verbal destruction, Rachel almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr. Mitchell looks philosophically at Dr. Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar.)
187		Commercial Break
188	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Monica sit round the coffee table, playing Scrabble. Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation.]
189	Rachel	 (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...") ...dead!
190		(Monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until she's distracted by Marcel as he clambers all over her nice furniture.)
191	Monica	 Ross, he's got the remote again.
192	Ross	 Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
193		(Marcel changes channel to Bugs Bunny, who is speaking in Spanish.)
194	Ross	 Maybe not.
195		(Meanwhile, Rachel has taken another call, from a nurse she'd hoped never to hear from again.)
196	Rachel	 Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
197		(All animosity forgotten, Rachel holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to her friend, who stands up in concern.)
198	Rachel	 It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
199	Rachel and Monica	 Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
200	Monica	 I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
201	Rachel	 Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.
202	Monica	 (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)
203	Rachel	 What?
204	Monica	 We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
205	Rachel	 Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
206	Monica	 Thank you.
207	Rachel	 Okay, let me just change.
208	Monica	 Yes.
209		(Rachel goes to her room.)
210	Joey	 (entering quietly) Hey.
211	Ross and Chandler	 Hey!
212	Monica	 Hi.
213	Phoebe	 Trouble?
214	Joey	 Your sister stood me up the other night.
215	Phoebe	 Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
216	Ross	 Well did you try calling her?
217	Joey	 I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
218		(Phoebe wants to be angry with Joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain and disbelief, she knows that it isn't his fault.)
219	[Scene	 Riff's, Phoebe is entering. Ursula returns with two plates of chicken, but she only has time to set one on the table, when...]
220	Phoebe	 Hey.
221		(Ursula turns in surprise.)
222	Ursula	 Oh!
223	Phoebe	 Um you, you got a minute?
224	Ursula	 Um, yeah, I'm just... (waving dismissively at the concept) ..working.
225		(Ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down. Departing customers walk right past the pair. Sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman looks most annoyed as Ursula sets his meal down in front of her. The girls sit.)
226	Phoebe	 So.
227	Ursula	 Uh-huh.
228		(Ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years. Phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.)
229	Phoebe	 Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
230		(Ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while Phoebe removes a present from her bag.)
231	Ursula	 Oh, wow! You remembered! (Opening it) Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
232		(She laughs at the childhood memory. Phoebe smiles at being able to make her point.)
233	Phoebe	 Right, like the kind you...
234	Ursula	 Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
235		(Ursula gets up to fetch a box from her bag by the counter.)
236	Phoebe	 How'd you know I was coming?
237	Ursula	 Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
238		(Ursula puts the box directly into Phoebe's hand. Phoebe brightens.)
239	Phoebe	 I can't believe you did this.
240		(Phoebe opens the box, to find something familiar inside.)
241	Phoebe	 I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.
242		(Phoebe's smile hardens as she packs the cardigan away.)
243	Phoebe	 So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
244	Ursula	 Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
245		(Ursula resumes eating her lunch..)
246	Phoebe	 Does he know?
247	Ursula	 Who?
248	Phoebe	 Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
249	Ursula	 He is? Why?
250	Phoebe	 You got me.
251	Ursula	 Right.
252		(A waiter comes over for the stolen chicken. Ursula turns to him.)
253	Ursula	 Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
254		(The man gives up, shaking his head.)
255	Phoebe	 So, um, are you gonna call him?
256	Ursula	 What? (Indicating the departing waiter) Do you think he likes me?
257	Phoebe	 No, Joey.
258	Ursula	 Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her food) Do you want some chicken?
259	Phoebe	 No. No food with a face.
260	Ursula	 You have not changed!
261		(Ursula's eyes dance as she laughs and smiles, simply glad to be back with her sister.)
262	Phoebe	 Yeah, you too.
263		(Trying not to wrinkle her nose, Phoebe smiles back realising it's down to her to make up for her negligent sister. Meanwhile, Ursula still hasn't received her side salad, but when she attempts to attract the waiter's attention, he ignores her.)
264	[Scene	 The Emergency Room. The officious admissions nurse is again on duty. Rachel and Monica enter, looking worried. As they approach the desk, Rachel adopts a winning smile, while Monica struggles to smile at all.]
265	Rachel	 (as Monica) Hi, remember us?
266	Nurse	 (Grimacing) Mmm hmmm.
267	Monica	 (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...
268	Nurse	 You're that stupid.
269	Monica	 (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
270	Rachel	 (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
271	Nurse	 Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
272	Rachel	 (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
273		(The girls escape with a new form.)
274	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is neglecting the game of Scrabble, for he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters about.]
275	Chandler	 Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
276	Ross	 Uh-huh.
277	Chandler	 Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
278	Ross	 Do you have a point?
279	Chandler	 You know, you think I would.
280		(Instead of scampering, Marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.)
281	Chandler	 What's up with the simian?
282	Ross	 It's just a fur ball.
283	Chandler	 Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
284	Ross	 Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
285	Chandler	 No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
286	Ross	 I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
287		(The unvoiced hissing continues. In alarm, Ross and Chandler look at the monkey, who is now in some distress.)
288	[Scene	 The Emergency Room, Monica sits with Rachel, who is filling out an honest form at last. Ross and Chandler hurtle in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled in Ross's arms. They dash up to the admissions desk. Ross is frantic.]
289	Ross	 You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
290		(Hearing her brother's voice, Monica gets up to stand behind Chandler, followed by Rachel.)
291	Nurse	 (angrily) You go get that animal outta here.
292	Ross	 No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
293	Monica	 What's goin' on?
294		(Ross and Chandler turn at the voice...)
295	Chandler	 Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
296	Rachel	 Oh.
297		(..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and Ross and Chandler whip around once more. Monica and Rachel recoil slightly.)
298	Nurse	 Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
299	Ross	 Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
300		(Ross's vigorous protest is attracting attention.)
301	Dr. Mitchell	 I'll take a look at him.
302		(Rachel, Monica, Ross and Chandler whip around for a second time, in formation.)
303	Rachel and Monica	 Oh, thank you.
304	Monica	 Michael.
305	Dr. Mitchell	 Rachel.
306	Rachel	 What?
307	Monica	 (as Rachel) Monica.
308	Rachel	 (as Monica) Oh.
309	Monica	 (as Rachel) Hi.
310	Rachel	 (as Monica) Hi.
311		(Monica smiles to cover her embarrassment, but Rachel sadly looks away...)
312	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey is playing "She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not" with the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.]
313	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) Hey.
314	Joey	 Urse...
315		(Phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.)
316	Joey	 ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
317	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) Listen, um...
318	Joey	 No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
319	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) I'm sorry.
320	Joey	 I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
321		(Phoebe is almost thrown by this.)
322	Phoebe	 (as Ursula)
323	Joey	 You don't drink.
324	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
325	Joey	 Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)
326	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
327	Joey	 Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
328	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
329	Joey	 (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
330	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
331	Joey	 Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
332		(He sinks to the sofa, saddened by Ursula's ultimatum, while Phoebe follows, touched by Joey's good heart.)
333	Phoebe	 (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
334	Joey	 I know...
335		(He looks up at her face and Phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. Joey's voice becomes soft and warm.)
336	Joey	 I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
337	Phoebe	 Really?
338		(Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts "Oh, whoa!!" to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. A thoughtful Joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...)
339	Joey	 Pheebs?
340	Phoebe	 (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)
341	[Scene	 The Hospital, Marcel lies on the operating table while recovering from the anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. Ross sits beside him, as a smiling Chandler, Monica and Rachel look on.]
342	Ross	 He looks so tiny.
343		(The door bursts open, and Joey and Phoebe rush in.)
344	Joey	 We just got the message.
345	Phoebe	 Is he alright?
346	Ross	 Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
347	Chandler	 We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
348		(Ross does not approve of Chandler's daft theory.)
349	Ross	 Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
350	Chandler	 (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?
351	Ross	 No, why?
352	Chandler	 Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
353		(Ross does approve of this, but he's still not sure. The tiny figure stirs.)
354	Monica	 Oh, look, he's waking up!
355	Ross	 (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?
356		(All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad!)
357		Closing Credits
358	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is there. Rachel is looking out of the window and Ross is handing out some Chinese takeout. There's a small SAP in the corner of the screen.]

360	Monica	 �A qui�n pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's chicken?)

363	Rachel	 �Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est� haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look, Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)
364		(The others rush to the window for a look.)

367	All	 �Hola, Joey! (Hi, Joey!)

371	Ross	 �Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t like the program!)
372		(Everybody laughs.)
