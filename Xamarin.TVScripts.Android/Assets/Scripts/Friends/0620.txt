14	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me.
15	Joey	 Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.
16	Phoebe	 (tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!

36	Rachel	 I'm sorry, what?
37	Monica	 What?
38	Ross	 Excuse me?
39	Joey	 It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
40	Chandler	 Oh, ok.
41	Joey	 (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)

57	Chandler	 Hey! How’d the audition go?
58	Joey	 Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!
59	Ross	 Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
60	Joey	 Yeah, did I fool ya?
61	Ross	 Totally!
62	Chandler	 So it did go well.
63	Joey	 Oh, it went amazingly well!
64	Ross	 Great!

66	Joey	 Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.
67	Chandler	 Oh my God!
68	Ross	 Wow!

70	Ross	 Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)
71	Chandler	 Oh-oh, what are you doing?
72	Ross	 (stops laughing) What am I doing?
73	Joey	 I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
74	Chandler	 Well, it is overdue.
75	Ross	 Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
76	Joey	 There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
77	Ross	 Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

87	Interviewer	 So, uh, what are you going to do next?
88	Monica	 Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.

106	Monica	 Was it...
107	Phoebe	 Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
108		[The next flashback is from The One With Ross's Sandwich, Ross his confronting his boss about him eating Ross's sandwich.]

110	Dr. Leedbetter	 It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
111	Ross	 (getting upset) Oh-oh really?
112	Dr. Leedbetter	 Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
113	Ross	 (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
114	Dr. Leedbetter	 Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.

123	Chandler	 Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for (struggles to get this out) Monica’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5
124	Monica	 (startled) Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?
125	Chandler	 (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
126	Monica	 We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
127	Chandler	 Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
128	Monica	 Wh?! What about my allergies?!
129	Chandler	 Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
130	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey and Chandler are playing foosball and Joey scores a goal.]
131	Joey	 Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
132	Chandler	 As crazy as soccer?

135	Chandler	 You mean you didn’t get it from this?
136	Joey	 The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
137	Chandler	 Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
138	Joey	 How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!
139	Chandler	 I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.
140	Joey	 Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
141	Chandler	 Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?
142		[Joey just laughs as a third set of flashbacks featuring Chandler’s mistakes starts. The first flashback is from The One With The Prom Video. It's Chandler telling Phoebe how much he hates the bracelet Joey bought him. They're both at Central Perk.]
143	Chandler	 You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
144	Phoebe	 It's not that bad.
145	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
146	Phoebe	 Chandler, Chandler.

150	Joey	 And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
151	Chandler	 No! No! No! I just kissed her.
152	Joey	 What?!! That’s even worse!!
153	Chandler	 How is that worse?!
154	Joey	 I don’t know! But it’s the same!
155	Chandler	 You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
156	Joey	 Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
157		[Cut back to Joey and Rachel’s apartment.]
158	Chandler	 Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
159	Joey	 Name one!
160		[Chandler proceeds to point out Joey’s errors in this forth set of flashbacks. The first flashback is from The One With The Cat. Chandler has just returned home to see that their apartment has been cleaned out and finds Joey trapped in the entertainment center.]
161	Chandler	 (lets him out) What happened?!!
162	Joey	 (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
163	Chandler	 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
164	Joey	 Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
165	Chandler	 So--You got in voluntarily?!
166	Joey	 I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?

171	Chandler	 ...And what did you bring?
172	Lorraine	 She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
173	Chandler	 Janice?
174		(Lorraine leaves. Joey shakes his head as though to say, 'It can't be the same Janice.' Janice enters.)
175	Chandler	 Janice?!
176	Janice	 Oh.... my.... God.
177		[The next flashback is from The One With Ross's New Girlfriend. Chandler is telling Ross and Joey that Joey's tailor took advantage of him.]
178	Chandler	 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
179	Ross	 What?

181	Chandler	 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
182	Ross	 What?
183	Chandler	 Cupping.
184	Joey	 That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?

191	Monica	 Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…
192	Chandler	 Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
193	Rachel	 Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
194	Chandler	 Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
195	Rachel	 Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
196	Monica	 Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay…
197	Chandler	 You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?
198	Rachel	 I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.
199		[We then go into another set of flashbacks of famous fights. The first is the second breakup of Ross and Rachel from The One With The Jellyfish.]
200	Ross	 It took two people to break up this relationship!!
201	Rachel	 Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
202	Ross	 I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!

209	Rachel	 And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
210	Chandler	 (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
211		[The next flashback is from The One After The Superbowl, Part II. Monica and Rachel are fighting over who gets to see Jean-Claude Van Damme.]
212	Monica	 You had no right to go out with him.
213	Rachel	 That is the most ridiculous...
214	Monica	 You sold me out.
215	Rachel	 I did not sell you out.
216	Monica	 Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
217	Rachel	 Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
218	Monica	 Did you just flick me?
219	Rachel	 OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
220		(They keep flicking each other. This turns into slapping each other.)
221	Phoebe	 Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
222		(Rachel tackles Monica onto the couch.)
223	Phoebe	 Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
224		(They wrestle on the couch for a little while until Monica gets the upper hand and pulls Rachel off of the couch by her sock. Monica removes Rachel's sock and starts beating her with it.)This leads to wrestling on the floor. This finally angers Phoebe.)
225	Phoebe	 OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
226	(Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear.) Monica and Rachel	 Ow! Ow! Ow!
227	Phoebe	 I know! I know! I know!
228	Phoebe	 Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.

234	Chandler	 Oh my God!
235	Joey	 Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
236		(Chandler does this throat sound.)
237	Joey	 Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
238		[The next flashback is from The One Where Eddie Moves In. It's the sequence where Joey and Chandler are both saddened that they're not living together anymore. All By Myself is playing in the background.]
239		[Joey's place. He goes to say something to Chandler in the other chair but no one's there. He goes to call Chandler but decides not to and throws the phone back down.]
240		[Chandler's. He's playing foosball by himself.]
241		[Joey's. Playing ping pong by himself.]

244	Chandler	 Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2

246	Joey	 Hey!
247	Chandler	 Please tell me you got the message!
248	Joey	 What message?
249	Chandler	 The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
250	Joey	 What?! It’s 6 o’clock!
251	Chandler	 Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!

263	Chandler	 You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
264	Joey	 You hug me!
265	Chandler	 All right!
266		[What follows is the final set of flashbacks that feature a whole lot of lovin’ between Chandler and Joey. There’s no words, just hugs and even the kiss from The One With The Monkey. All of this is set to the song, You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me!]
267		[Cut back to the present, they are still in each other’s embrace.]
268	Joey	 Hey, do we do this too much?
269	Chandler	 I think so. Yeah, get off me.
270	Joey	 Yeah.
271		(They separate.)
272		Ending Credits
273	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey and Phoebe are reading a scene from Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.]
274	Joey	 Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
275	Phoebe	 (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
276	Joey	 Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry you.
277		(Suddenly Ross jumps up from behind the counter armed with a plastic gun. By the way, he’s overacting too.)
278	Ross	 That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when you’re dead!
279	Joey	 Ross, you don’t have to yell.
280	Ross	 There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
281	Phoebe	 I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where’d Ross go?"
282	Ross	 Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
283	Phoebe	 Yeah?
284	Ross	 Oh my God. I mean…
285	Joey	 Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
286	Phoebe	 (To Ross) He’s holding us back.
287	Ross	 Totally.
