3		(Ross and Rachel enter)
4	Rachel	 Hi!
5	Ross	 Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
6	Chandler	 Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
7	Ross	 Oh my God!
8	Phoebe	 What?!
9	Rachel	 What?!
10	Ross	 Monday?!
11	Joey	 How long do you have to go for?
12	Chandler	 They said it could be up to a year.
13	Joey	 A year?!
14	Rachel	 (To Monica) Do you have to go?
15	Monica	 I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)
16	Chandler	 There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
17	Joey	 Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
18	Chandler	 I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
19	Joey	 We were gonna go see the Jets!
20	Ross	 You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
21	Chandler	 Really?
22	Ross	 Not you.
23	Joey	 I can't believe you guys are moving.
24	Phoebe	 I call their apartment!!!
25	Everyone	 No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
26		[INTRO]
27	[SCENE	 Central Perk]
28	Joey	 Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)
29	Rachel	 Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
30	Ross	 I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
31	Rachel	 Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
32	Joey	 (Laughs)
33	Rachel	 Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)
34	Joey	 Uhuh.
35	Ross	 Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
36	Rachel	 All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)
37	Ross	 Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
38	Rachel	 I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross and Rachel walk away)
39	Joey	 (Laughs)
40	Phoebe	 It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
41	Joey	 I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)
42	Phoebe	 Look at you all grown up.
43	Joey	 Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
44	Phoebe	 You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
45	Joey	 I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
46	Phoebe	 Done. Oh good, really?
47	Joey	 Yeah!
48	Phoebe	 Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
49	Joey	 (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)
50	Phoebe	 Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller
51	Joey	 (Laughs)
52	[SCENE	 Chandler and Monica's apartment]
53	Chandler	 (Enters) Hey!
54	Monica	 Hey!
55	Chandler	 I've got good news!
56	Monica	 You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
57	Chandler	 Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
58	Monica	 It's great! How?
59		Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.
60	Monica	 So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.
61	Chandler	 I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
62	Monica	 No. I can't be away from you for that long.
63	Chandler	 Really?
64	Monica	 Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
65	Chandler	 That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
66	Monica	 Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
67	Chandler	 Hey, you said that without gagging!
68	Monica	 I know! (They high-five.)
69	[SCENE	 Ross and Rachel's apartment]
70	Rachel	 (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! (Hangs up)
71	Ross	 (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
72	Rachel	 Dr. Wiener.
73	Ross	 Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
74	Rachel	 Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
75	Ross	 Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
76	Rachel	 Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
77	Ross	 Well, what was it?
78	Rachel	 Hiccups.
79	Ross	 Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
80	Rachel	 Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
81	Ross	 Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
82	Rachel	 Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
83	Ross	 Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
84	Rachel	 What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
85	Ross	 You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)
86	Rachel	 (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!
87	Ross	 (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
88	Rachel	 Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
89	[SCENE	 Joey's apartment]
90	Phoebe	 (Enters) Hey!
91	Joey	 Hey!
92	Phoebe	 So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She is all dressed up)
93	Joey	 (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) Oh my God!
94	Phoebe	 Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
95	Joey	 Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
96	Phoebe	 Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
97	Joey	 No.
98	Phoebe	 Come on, give me something. What's his name?
99	Joey	 Mike.
100	Phoebe	 Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
101	Joey	 Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
102	Phoebe	 All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
103	Joey and Phoebe	 (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)
104	Joey	 Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!
105	[SCENE	 Chandler and Monica's apartment]
106	Rachel	 It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
107	Monica	 Excuse me?
108	Chandler	 I know what she's talking about.
109	Rachel	 We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
110	Monica	 Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
111	Rachel	 Ross said he died.
112	Monica	 He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
113	Rachel	 Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
114	Monica	 Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
115	Chandler	 He saw a therapist?
116	Monica	 Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
117	Rachel	 Why? What was it?
118	Monica	 That I was going to eat him.
119	[SCENE	 Central Perk]
120		(Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)
121	Joey	 MIKE!!!
122	Mike	 Yeah?
123	Joey	 (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)
124	[SCENE	 Restaurant]
125	Mike	 I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.
126	Joey	 Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
127	Mike	 I am Mike.
128	Joey	 Atta boy!
129		(Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)
130	Joey	 Okay, look...
131	Everyone	 (Ad-lib hellos)
132	Phoebe	 Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
133	Mike	 How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
134	Joey	 (Laughs) From school.
135	Mike	 Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.
136	Phoebe	 Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
137	Mike	 Well, I'm a lawyer.
138	Joey	 Mike, 'attorney at law'!
139	Mike	 Actually, I just gave up my practice.
140	Joey	 What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
141	Mike	 I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
142	Phoebe	 Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
143	Joey	 Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
144	Mary Ellen	 I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
145	Joey	 No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
146	[SCENE	 Chandler and Monica's apartment]
147		(Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)
148	Monica	 Hey!
149	Chandler	 Hey!
150	Monica	 What are you doing?
151	Chandler	 Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
152	Monica	 That's so sweet. Find anything?
153	Chandler	 Slim Pickings.
154	Monica	 Nothing, huh?
155	Chandler	 No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
156	Monica	 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
157	Chandler	 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
158	Monica	 Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
159	Chandler	 Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
160	Monica	 (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'
161	[SCENE	 Pediatrician's office]
162	Rachel	 Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
163	Receptionist	 Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.
164	Dr. Gettleman	 (To a patient) I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.
165	Ross	 Thanks doctor.
166	Dr. Gettleman	 Would you like a lollypop?
167	Ross	 You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!
168	[SCENE	 Restaurant]
169	Phoebe	 You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
170	Joey	 Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
171	Mike	 No, I didn't.
172	Joey	 That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
173		Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?
174	Joey	 Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)
175	Mary Ellen	 Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
176	Mike	 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
177	Phoebe	 What?!
178	Mike	 What?!
179	Joey	 What?!
180	Phoebe	 Do you not know each other?
181	Joey	 (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
182	Phoebe	 Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
183	Mike	 (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!
184	Joey	 What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!
185	Phoebe	 Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
186	Joey	 Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
187	Mike	 I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
188	Phoebe	 (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
189	Mary Ellen	 Hey!
190	Phoebe	 Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
191	Joey	 Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!
192	Phoebe	 I'm out of here (She leaves)
193	Mike	 It was nice meeting you!
194	Joey	 (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?
195	Mary Ellen	 I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
196	Joey	 Good night!
197	[SCENE	 Chandler and Monica's apartment]
198	Chandler	 Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
199	Monica	 You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.
200	Chandler	 What?
201	Monica	 So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
202	Chandler	 How far outside?
203	Monica	 Manhattan.
204	Chandler	 And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.
205	Monica	 I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
206	Chandler	 What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
207	Monica	 Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
208	Chandler	 I think you should take the job.
209	Monica	 Really?
210	Chandler	 Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
211	Monica	 That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
212		(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)
213	Ross	 Hey!
214	Monica	 How was the pediatrician?
215	Rachel	 Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
216	Ross	 You promised you wouldn't say anything.
217	Rachel	 I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!
218	Monica	 Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
219	Ross	 He's a brilliant diagnostician!
220	Chandler	 Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
221	Rachel	 Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
222	Ross	 Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
223	Chandler	 Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
224	Ross	 Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
225	Chandler	 That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
226	Ross	 It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
227	[SCENE	 Central Perk]
228	Mike	 Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?
229	Phoebe	 Sure.
230	Mike	 I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.
231	Phoebe	 Why did you go along with that?
232	Mike	 Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
233	Phoebe	 That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
234	Mike	 My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
235	Phoebe	 Prove it.
236	Mike	 There isn't a piano here.
237	Phoebe	 That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
238	Mike	 (Plays 'air piano')
239	Phoebe	 You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
240	Mike	 Really?
241	Phoebe	 Uhuh.
242	Mike	 That's great. What kind of music do you play?
243	Phoebe	 Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
244	Mike	 Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
245	Phoebe	 It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
246	Mike	 Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
247	Joey	 (Walks In)
248	Phoebe	 (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
249	Joey	 Look at this. My two best friends!
250		(Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)
251	[SCENE	 Pediatrician's office]
252	Ross	 Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
253	Receptionist	 The doctor will be right with you sir.
254	Girl	 (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
255	Ross	 With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
256	Woman	 Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
257	Ross	 Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
258	Sally	 Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
259	Ross	 I am a single parent.
260	Sally	 It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
261	Ross	 Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
262	Nurse	 (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.
263	Ross	 Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
264	Boy	 Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)
265	Girl	 Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
266	Ross	 Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
267	[SCENE	 Chandler and Monica's apartment]
268	Ross	 (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.
269	Monica	 Where have you been?
270	Ross	 I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
271	Chandler	 Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)
272	Ross	 Oh man.
273	Monica	 Promise to call me when you land.
274	Chandler	 Of course I will call you. I love you.
275	Monica	 I love you too. (They kiss)
276	Rachel	 Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
277	Phoebe	 Bye Chandler.
278	Chandler	 Awww. (They hug) Bye!
279	Rachel	 Bye honey. (They hug)
280	Chandler	 (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?
281	Joey	 I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
282	Chandler	 Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
283	Joey	 Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
284	Chandler	 Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
285	Phoebe	 Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)
286	Monica	 (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes
287	Chandler	 I know.
288	Monica	 I love you so much.
289	Chandler	 I know that too. (They kiss)
290		(Joey opens the door and takes Chandler's suitcase into his own apartment.)
291	[SCENE	 Airport]
292	Chandler	 (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
293	CUT TO	 Monica and Chandler's apartment.
294	Joey	 (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me when you land.
295	Monica	 Can I talk now?
296	Joey	 Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)
297	Monica	 Joey?
298	Joey	 He had to board. End
