5	[Scene	 Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]
6	Monica	 Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)
7	Chandler	 You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
8	Monica	 I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
9	Chandler	 You're on!
10		(they start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's room)
11	Phoebe	 Hey!
12	Monica	 What's up?
13	Phoebe	 Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
14		(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some indistinct murmuring)
15	Ross	 ... finally...
16	Phoebe	 Is that Ross?
17	Monica	 Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
18	Phoebe	 Sounds like he's with someone.
19	Chandler	 He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
20	Monica	 Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
21		(they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)
22	Charlie	 Ooh... Dr. Geller!
23	Ross	 God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
24	Monica	 Oh my God, that's Charlie!
25	Chandler	 She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
26	Phoebe	 Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
27	Monica	 I'm not sure about this.
28	Phoebe	 Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
29	Monica	 No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
30	Phoebe	 Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
31	Rachel	 (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!
32		(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There, Joey and Rachel are kissing.)
33	Joey	 Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
34	Rachel	 I know, I'm her!
35		(they start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)
36	Phoebe	 (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
37	Monica	 What?
38	Phoebe	 Get over here!
39		(Chandler and Monica take a sprint to the other wall)
40	Rachel	 ooh...
41	Chandler	 Wow!
42	Monica	 (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
43		(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing. We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair stuffed in her mouth by Chandler.)
44	Monica	 (muffled) Thank you.
45		OPENING CREDITS
46		(Rachel and Joey's)
47	Rachel	 Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
48	Joey	 Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
49	Rachel	 What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
50		(Chandler and Monica's)
51	Monica	 I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
52	Chandler	 How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
53	Monica	 I'm on it!
54	Chandler	 Anything?
55	Monica	 I think I hear curtains closing...
56	Phoebe	 We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
57	Monica	 Bedsprings, unmistakable!
58	Chandler	 You do realise that's your brother?
59	Monica	 Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
60	Chandler	 That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
61	Monica	 Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
62	Chandler	 Okay Buckwheat!
63	Phoebe	 You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)
64		(Ross and Charlie's)
65	Ross	 Weh...*sigh*
66	Charlie	 uhm... Is everything okay?
67	Ross	 Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
68	Charlie	 Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
69	Ross	 No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
70	Charlie	 I uhm... I completely understand.
71	Ross	 Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.
72	Charlie	 Okay...
73		(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to Ross and Charlie's)
74	Phoebe	 That's the door. He's gone...
75	Chandler	 And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
76	Monica	 Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
77		(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)
78	Ross	 Hey, what are you guys doing?
79	Phoebe	 Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
80	Monica	 (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)
81	Chandler	 (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
82	Ross	 Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
83	Chandler	 He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
84	Ross	 Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
85	Chandler	 You got it!
86	Ross	 Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)
87	Monica	 Other wall, people! Other wall!
88		(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)
89	Ross	 (knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)
90	Joey	 Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
91	Rachel	 Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!
92	Joey	 No idea what it means.
93	Rachel	 Oh... okay, just hide!
94	Ross	 (knocks) Rach?
95	Rachel	 Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
96		(When Rachel starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again)
97	Rachel	 There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)
98	Ross	 Is everything okay?
99	Rachel	 Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)
100	Ross	 Hey.
101	Rachel	 Hi...
102	Ross	 You know where Joey is?
103	Rachel	 ...I really don't... (looks around again)
104	Ross	 Can I talk to you for a minute?
105	Rachel	 Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)
106		(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed against the wall, and Joey looks at them)
107	Joey	 I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
108	Phoebe	 Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
109		(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door, which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)
110	Ross	 And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
111	Rachel	 (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
112	Ross	 And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
113	Rachel	 (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
114	Ross	 Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
115	Rachel	 (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
116	Ross	 You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
117	Rachel	 You would think!
118		(Ross leaves the room)
119	Rachel	 Joey!
120	Joey	 Is he gone?
121	Rachel	 (still can't find him) How are you doing this?
122		(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are following him.)
123	Joey	 Pssst...
124	Rachel	 How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
125	Monica, Chandler and Phoebe	 YE-AH!
126	Phoebe	 Now, what is this?
127	Rachel	 Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
128	Phoebe	 Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
129	Joey	 Well, he's with Charlie now.
130	Monica	 Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
131	Joey	 (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
132	Rachel	 All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
133	Chandler	 Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
134	Rachel	 Sure...
135	Chandler	 Enunciate!
136	Rachel	 Get out!
137		(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)
138	Rachel	 Are they right?
139	Joey	 Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
140	Rachel	 Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
141	Joey	 Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
142	Rachel	 (Joey walks to the door) Although...
143	Joey	 (turns around very fast) I like although!
144	Rachel	 I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
145	Joey	 Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
146	Rachel	 Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
147	Joey	 Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
148	Rachel	 No...
149	Joey	 I'm thinking about you...
150	Rachel	 Yeah...
151	Joey	 Let's forget about Ross...
152	Rachel	 Forgotten.
153		(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly, gasping)
154	Joey	 What's wrong?
155	Rachel	 Nothing...
156	Joey's voice, but she sees Ross	 Seriously... What is it?
157	Rachel	 Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
158		(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)
159	Joey's voice/Ross	 What's wrong?
160	Rachel	 Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
161	Joey	 Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)
162	Rachel/Ross	 Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)
163	Joey	 Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
164	Both	 Yeah
165		COMMERCIAL BREAK
166	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on the door and enters...]
167	Ross	 Hey!
168	Chandler	 Hey!
169	Ross	 You guys ready to go?
170	Chandler	 Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
171	Ross	 Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
172	Chandler	 You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
173	Ross	 Learn about Jesus...
174		(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)
175	Ross	 Hey!
176	Charlie	 So, did you talk to Joey?
177	Ross	 Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
178	Charlie	 Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
179	Ross	 Stop it!
180	Charlie	 PHD
181	Ross	 You're filthy!
182		(Phoebe enters)
183	Phoebe	 Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
184	Ross	 Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
185	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
186		(Monica enters, with her hair braided and little shells at the end)
187	Monica	 Check it out!
188	Phoebe	 Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
189		(Chandler enters from the bathroom)
190	Chandler	 Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
191	Monica	 What do you think?
192	Chandler	 I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
193	Monica	 Don't you just love it?
194	Ross	 Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
195	Charlie	 It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
196	Ross	 You've never said that in your life, have you?
197	Charlie	 Not once.
198	Ross	 I thought so.
199	Monica	 And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)
200	Chandler	 What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
201	[Scene	 Boarding the plane.]
202	Joey	 Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
203	Chandler	 Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
204	Joey	 Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
205	Ross	 Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
206	Joey	 I understand...
207	Ross	 No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)
208	Chandler	 Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
209		(Switch to Phoebe and Mike, who are kissing)
210	Phoebe	 Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
211	Mike	 You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
212	Phoebe	 Aaah... you're not good at this...
213	Mike	 You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
214	Phoebe	 No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
215	Mike	 Oh...
216	Phoebe	 What?
217	Mike	 Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
218	Phoebe	 Why not?
219	Mike	 I have a date.
220	Phoebe	 You have a... You have a date? With who?
221	Mike	 Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
222	Phoebe	 (lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?
223	Mike	 Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
224	Phoebe	 For how long?
225	Mike	 Three months.
226	Phoebe	 Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
227	Mike	 I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
228	Phoebe	 Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
229	Mike	 Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
230	Phoebe	 You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
231		(cut to Charlie and Ross)
232	Ross	 Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
233	Charlie	 Okay... Good luck.
234		(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)
235	Rachel	 Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
236	Joey	 I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
237	Rachel	 Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
238	Joey	 Ooh...
239	Rachel	 Still nervous?
240	Joey	 I'm gonna get the lasagna.
241	Ross	 Hey Rach...
242	Rachel	 Yeah!
243	Ross	 Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
244	Rachel	 Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to Joey and gets up from her seat)
245	Ross	 Hey!
246	Joey	 Hey!
247	Ross	 So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
248	Joey	 Yeah?
249	Ross	 Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
250	Joey	 You kissed.
251	Ross	 Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
252	Joey	 I saw you.
253	Ross	 Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
254	Joey	 Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
255	Ross	 What?
256	Joey	 It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
257	Ross	 Are you serious?
258	Joey	 Yeah... Now I have something...
259	Ross	 I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
260	Joey	 Oh... uh... look... before you...
261	Ross	 No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
262	Joey	 I am those things, yeah.
263	Ross	 You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
264	Joey	 Dude!
265	Ross	 Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
266	Joey	 I can't think of anything.
267		(They both hug, and Rachel, who was in the back of the plane, sees this and smiles.)
268	Ross	 Thanks!
269	Joey	 Yeah.
270		(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)
271	Rachel	 So hi!
272	Ross	 Hi!
273	Rachel	 So you eh, you talked to Joey?
274	Ross	 Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
275	Rachel	 Oh! That's great!
276	Ross	 Yeah!
277	Rachel	 Oh, so everything's okay?
278	Ross	 Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
279	Rachel	 Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
280	Ross	 Well, I'm so excited about this.
281	Rachel	 Really? Excited?
282	Ross	 Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
283	Rachel	 Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?
284	Joey	 I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
285	Rachel	 Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
286	Joey	 Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
287		(Chandler walks by and Joey lets out an evil "muhahaho".)
288		COMMERCIAL BREAK
289	[Scene	 Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]
290	Phoebe	 Hi, Mike's place.
291	Mike	 Hey, it's Mike.
292	Phoebe	 Ooh, that was fast.
293	Mike	 Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
294	Phoebe	 Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
295	Mike	 One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
296	Phoebe	 Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
297	Mike	 Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
298	Phoebe	 Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
299		(there's knocking on the door which Phoebe opens)
300	Precious	 Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
301	Phoebe	 (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.
302	Precious	 Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
303	Phoebe	 Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)
304	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper to their coffee table.]
305	Monica	 Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!
306	Chandler	 You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
307	Monica	 Yeah!
308	Chandler	 So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
309	Monica	 Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
310	Chandler	 What are you singing?
311	Monica	 It's "Bolero" from "10".
312	Chandler	 It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing
313	Monica	 You what? You said you liked them.
314	Chandler	 Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
315	Monica	 Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
316	Chandler	 Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
317	Monica	 You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!
318	Chandler	 Hit yourself in the tooth?
319	Monica	 And the eye!
320	[Scene	 Ross's apartment.Someone's knocking on the door. Ross rushes to the door and it's Rachel with Emma.]
321	Ross	 (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
322	Rachel	 That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
323	Ross	 Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
324	Rachel	 Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
325	Ross	 (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!
326	Rachel	 Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
327	Ross	 (gasps) OH NO!
328	Rachel	 What? What is it?
329	Ross	 Oh, major shampoo explosion!
330	Rachel	 Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
331	Ross	 Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)
332	Rachel	 Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
333	Ross	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
334	Rachel	 Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
335	Ross	 Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
336	Rachel	 Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
337	Ross	 Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)
338	[Scene	 Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]
339	Phoebe	 Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
340	Precious	 I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
341	Phoebe	 Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
342	Precious	 My name is Precious.
343	Phoebe	 Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
344	Precious	 I just can't believe this... Why?
345	Phoebe	 Well, I don't...
346	Precious	 Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
347	Phoebe	 Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
348	Precious	 I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
349	Phoebe	 Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
350		(Precious starts crying)
351	Phoebe	 Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
352	Precious	 I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
353	Phoebe	 But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
354	Precious	 He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)
355	Phoebe	 Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
356	Precious	 Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
357		(Mike enters the apartment.)
358	Precious	 Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
359		(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he doesn't believe what just happened. Precious leaves, and he turns to Phoebe.)
360	Phoebe	 You're welcome!
361	[Scene	 Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks to the bathroom.]
362	Chandler	 Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
363	Monica	 Not really.
364		(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)
365	Monica	 I have a problem.
366	Chandler	 Really? What happened?
367	Monica	 Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
368	Chandler	 You can't move at all?
369	Monica	 Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)
370	Chandler	 If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
371	Monica	 (looking disappointed) I guess so...
372	Chandler	 (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.
373	Monica	 Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
374	[Scene	 Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.]
375	Joey	 Hey!
376	Rachel	 Hi!
377	Joey	 So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
378	Rachel	 Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
379	Joey	 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)
380	Rachel	 Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
381	Joey	 Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
382	Rachel	 Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
383	Joey	 I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
384	Rachel	 No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
385	Joey	 Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
386	Rachel	 Goo--ood night!
387	Joey	 Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)
388	Rachel	 Seriously, good night!
389	Joey	 Stop saying good night.
390	Rachel	 Okay.
391		(Now they kiss passionately... and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze, pull away and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing. Joey straightens his shirt, and Rachel says I'm so-oo sorry, and presses her breasts together, just like Joey did before.)
392		COMMERCIAL BREAK
393	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted Rasta hats.]
394	Monica	 Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...
395	Chandler	 Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
396	Monica	 Sure, what do you have in mind?
397	Chandler	 I think you know.
398	Monica	 Really? I don't really feel like it.
399	Chandler	 This is what I want to do.
400	Monica	 Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
401	Chandler	 (Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
402		THE END
