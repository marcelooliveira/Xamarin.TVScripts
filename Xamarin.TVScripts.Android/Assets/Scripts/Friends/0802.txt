2	[Scene	 The Hotel Lobby, Rachel and Phoebe are at the front desk checking out.]
3	Rachel	 Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
4	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
5	Phoebe	 Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
6	Joey	 No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
7		(Chandler and Monica enter.)
8	Chandler	 (to the front desk clerk) Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.
9	Monica	 (depressed) That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife!
10	Chandler	 And I’m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
11	Monica	 Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)
12	Chandler	 We got the honeymoon.
13	Monica	 That’s not ‘til Thursday.
14	Chandler	 The wedding pictures?
15	Monica	 They won’t be ready for weeks.
16	Chandler	 Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
17	Monica	 That’s true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!
18	Chandler	 I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
19	Monica	 Okay.
20		(Joey giggles.)
21	Chandler	 What? What did you take a picture of?
22	Joey	 Nothing! It was something.
23	Chandler	 Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
24	Rachel	 Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
25	Chandler	 Oh.
26	Monica	 Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
27	Rachel	 Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
28	Chandler	 Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You’re 32! (Exits)
29	Front Desk Clerk	 (To Monica) Here’s a copy of your bill.
30	Monica	 Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
31	Joey	 Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut?
32		Opening Credits
33	[Scene	 Ross’s Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]
34	Ross	 Hi.
35	Chandler	 Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
36	Ross	 Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.
37	Chandler	 Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is this?
38	Ross	 Thread!
39	Chandler	 Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
40	Ross	 What disposable cameras?
41	Chandler	 The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
42	Ross	 No you didn’t.
43	Chandler	 Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…
44	Ross	 Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.
45	Chandler	 So you don’t have the cameras?!
46	Ross	 No. Sorry man.
47	Chandler	 So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
48	Ross	 Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.
49	Chandler	 Great.
50	Ross	 In-in three minutes.
51		(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away. Ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)
52	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a mound of wedding gifts.]
53	Phoebe	 Hey!
54	Monica	 Hey!
55	Phoebe	 Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
56	Monica	 No! (Pause) But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
57	Phoebe	 A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
58		(Monica opens it anyways.)
59	Monica	 A tiny salt shaker!!!
60	Phoebe	 Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
61	Monica	 Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
62	Phoebe	 Oh yeah.
63	Monica	 Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
64	Phoebe	 Okay.
65	Monica	 Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
66	Phoebe	 Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)
67	Monica	 Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
68	Rachel	 (entering) Hi.
69	Monica	 Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?
70	Rachel	 Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?
71	Monica	 No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.
72	Phoebe	 Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
73	Rachel	 Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
74	Phoebe	 Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
75	Rachel	 Ew! No!
76	Phoebe	 What?! I think he’s cute.
77	Rachel	 Well then you have his baby.
78	Phoebe	 Believe me I’m trying.
79	Monica	 Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.
80	Phoebe	 Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
81	Rachel	 Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
82	Phoebe	 Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.
83	Rachel	 Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.
84	Phoebe	 Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!
85	Monica	 What was that bam?
86	Phoebe	 I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.
87	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
88	Rachel	 Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
89	Joey	 (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
90	Rachel	 Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!
91	Joey	 Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?
92	Phoebe	 Oh yeah. That’s me.
93	Joey	 Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?
94	Phoebe	 Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)
95	Joey	 Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?
96	Phoebe	 You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.)
97	Joey	 Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
98	Phoebe	 David Lynn.
99	Joey	 David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)
100	Monica	 Who’s David Lynn?
101	Phoebe	 Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
102	[Scene	 The Banquet Room, Chandler is under one of the tables as Ross enters.]
103	Ross	 Chandler?
104	Chandler	 Hey! Did you find the cameras?
105	Ross	 No. Did you?
106	Chandler	 Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
107	Ross	 Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.
108	Chandler	 Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.
109	Ross	 Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
110	Chandler	 All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!
111	Ross	 I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
112	Chandler	 Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
113	Ross	 No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
114	Chandler	 Are you serious?
115	Ross	 I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
116	Chandler	 Marriage advice? Really?!
117	Ross	 I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?
118	Chandler	 I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.
119	Ross	 What about the chairs?
120	Chandler	 She picked those out too.
121	Ross	 How about the place settings?
122	Chandler	 That was her.
123	Ross	 What did you do?
124	Chandler	 I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
125	Ross	 Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
126	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is sitting on the couch as Phoebe enters.]
127	Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
128	Rachel	 Not yet.
129	Phoebe	 Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it Gunther?
130	Rachel	 No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther.
131	Phoebe	 Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…
132	Rachel	 Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!
133	Phoebe	 Why not?
134	Rachel	 I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!
135	Phoebe	 Bus?
136	Rachel	 No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
137	Phoebe	 Well-well but it is huge.
138	Rachel	 I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
139	Phoebe	 You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?
140	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding gifts.]
141	Joey	 (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
142	Monica	 No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
143	Joey	 Okay.
144	Monica	 Give me one more.
145	Joey	 Okay. (Hands her one.)
146	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey.
147	Joey	 Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
148	Phoebe	 All right. (She sits down like she’s pregnant again.)
149	Joey	 Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
150	Monica	 Oh my God! Joey!
151	Phoebe	 Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
152	Monica	 You can’t marry him!
153	Phoebe	 Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!
154	Monica	 Phoebe!
155	Joey	 Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!
156	Phoebe	 I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
157	Monica	 She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.
158	Joey	 Oh my God.
159	Phoebe	 Hey!
160	Monica	 Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!
161	Phoebe	 It’s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘I love you’ to him.)
162	Joey	 (smiles then stops) Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who’s the father?
163	Phoebe	 We don’t know.
164	Joey	 Ohh… I wonder if that dude.
165	Monica	 There’s a dude?
166	Joey	 Yeah.
167	Phoebe	 Who? Who is it?
168	Joey	 About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… (He walks out and closes the door.)
169	Phoebe	 Was that story over?
170		(They follow him and meet him in the hall coming out of his apartment carrying a sweater.)
171	Joey	 The guy left this.
172	Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica and Chandler’s.)
173	Monica	 People have got to finish their stories!
174		Commercial Break
175	[Scene	 The Banquet Room, Ross and Chandler are in their tuxes and have started to fake the pictures.]
176	Chandler	 (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
177	Woman At The Wedding	 Oh! Of course. (Ross and Chandler pose and she takes the picture.)
178	Man At The Wedding	 Uh, would you take one of us?
179	Chandler	 Uhh… Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
180	Woman At The Wedding	 It didn’t click.
181	Ross	 I heard it. I heard it.
182	Man At The Wedding	 But there was no flash.
183	Woman At The Wedding	 Why won’t you take our picture?
184	Chandler	 Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
185	Man At The Wedding	 Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
186	Chandler	 Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
187	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are about to go inside.]
188	Phoebe	 Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
189	Rachel	 What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
190	Phoebe	 I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
191	Rachel	 Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?
192	Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
193	Rachel	 Uh, let’s rip!
194	Phoebe	 Really? Are you sure?
195	Rachel	 Oh Phoebe!
196	Phoebe	 Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)
197	Tag	 Hey Rach.
198	[Scene	 The Banquet Room, Ross is taking a picture of a plant, Chandler a fork. The band stops.]
199	Chandler	 Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.
200	Ross	 Okay. Okay!
201		(He goes up on stage, mimes like he's giving the speech, and Chandler takes his picture. However, before he gets down everyone starts clinking their glasses for a real speech.)
202	Ross	 Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
203	Anxious Wedding Guest	 (rushing up) That’s my car!
204	Ross	 A ’95 LeSabre?!
205	Anxious Wedding Guest	 Yes!
206	Ross	 A green LeSabre?
207	Anxious Wedding Guest	 Yes!
208	Ross	 I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
209	Anxious Wedding Guest	 Yes! Green-blue!
210	Ross	 Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
211	Chandler	 Okay, you ready for the last picture?
212	Ross	 Yeah.
213	Chandler	 Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)
214	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
215	Tag	 So, what’s this about?
216	Phoebe	 Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
217	Tag	 No. (Unzips his coat.) This is my red sweater.
218	Phoebe	 Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)
219	Tag	 What’s going on Rach?
220	Rachel	 Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
221	Tag	 Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together.
222	Rachel	 Oh, it’s just not the right time.
223	Tag	 It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)
224	Rachel	 Okay.
225	Tag	 I’m ready for more.
226	Rachel	 Tag…
227	Tag	 Come on Rach, let’s give it another try.
228	Rachel	 I’m having a baby.
229	Tag	 Oh. (He drops her hand.)
230		(Pause)
231	Rachel	 You can go.
232	Tag	 Thank you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
233	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has finished opening all the presents. She’s ashamed of this, at least, because as someone enters…]
234	Monica	 (throwing up the last present) I don’t know how any of these got opened?!
235	Joey	 (entering) You opened them all?
236	Monica	 I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
237	Joey	 Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! (Holds it up.)
238	Monica	 Yeah. What is that?
239	Joey	 Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.
240		(Phoebe and Rachel enter.)
241	Monica	 Hey! How’d it go?
242	Joey	 Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
243	Rachel	 Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
244	Joey	 I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)
245	Rachel	 Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
246	Monica	 So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
247	Rachel	 No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
248	Joey	 Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.
249	Rachel	 I’m not?
250	Joey	 Listen I uh… (He takes her hand.) It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?
251	Rachel	 What?
252	Monica	 What?!
253	Phoebe	 What?!!
254	Joey	 Pheebs, give me the ring back!
255	Phoebe	 No!!
256	Rachel	 No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband.
257	Joey	 (heartbroken) I understand.
258	Rachel	 Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)
259	Phoebe	 I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
260	Joey	 Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…
261	Phoebe	 Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
262	Joey	 There you go!
263		(Chandler and Ross enter with the new pictures.)
264	Chandler	 We’re back!
265	Monica	 Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Let’s stay in the kitchen!
266	Chandler	 It’s picture time.
267	Ross	 Now you are going to love these.
268	Chandler	 (showing her the pictures) Here’s a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And that’s me. (Another one.) And that’s me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
269	Monica	 Wow! That is a great picture!
270	Chandler	 Eh?
271	Monica	 Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)
272	Ross	 Huh, didn’t see that coming.
273	Chandler	 Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
274	Monica	 That would be a good idea.
275	Chandler	 Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
276	Monica	 You kissed another woman!
277	Chandler	 Call it even?!
278	Monica	 Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)
279	Ross	 Well, I’m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
280	Phoebe	 Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
281	Ross	 No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
282		(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)
283	Monica and Phoebe	 Oh my God!!
284	Joey	 (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!
285		Closing Credits
286	[Scene	 A Street, Ross walks past Tag wearing the same red sweater.]
287	Ross	 Hey! How you doing?
288	Tag	 Good! Good, long time no see.
289	Ross	 Yeah.
290	Tag	 Like your sweater.
291	Ross	 Oh hey, right back at ya.
292	Tag	 Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh?
293	Ross	 Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?
294	Tag	 So whose is it?
295	Ross	 (shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
296	Tag	 Okay.
297		(They separate.)
298	Ross	 He is so weird.
