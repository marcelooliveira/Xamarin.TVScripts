149	Ross	 umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
150	Phoebe	 WHAT! WHY?
151	Ross	 well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
152	Phoebe	 (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
153	Ross	 well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)
154	Phoebe	 I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
155	Ross	 Good yeah just be honest with him.
156	Phoebe	 yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine.

161	[Scene	 Joey is back at Hayley's place after there date]
162	Hayley	 so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.
163	Joey	 Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
164	Hayley	 What?
165	Joey	 How could you not remember that we slept together?
166	Hayley	 What! When?
167	Joey	 I dunno!
168	Hayley	 I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
169	Joey	 come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
170	Hayley	 no it's not ringing any bells.
171	Joey	 my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?

174	[Scene	 Phoebe is sitting with Mike, explaining about Vicrum]
175	Phoebe	 .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
176	Mike	 But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
177	Phoebe	 yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
178	Mike	 that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
179	Phoebe	 I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
180	Mike	 I just think there's somebody better out there for you, (pause) I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
181	Phoebe	 Oh.
182	Mike	 and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
183	Phoebe	 ok I can't do this.
184	Mike	 what's wrong?
185	Phoebe	 well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.
186	Mike	 uh huh
187	Phoebe	 so you don't think I'm a total freak
188	Mike	 No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
189	Phoebe	 I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
190	Mike	 Definitely
191	Ross	 (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.
192	[Scene	 Chandler arrives home and Monica's got a video of Sharks ready for Chandler]
193	Chandler	 Hi honey I'm home!
194	Monica	 Hi, how was your flight? (She hugs him)
195	Chandler	 oh it was great.
196	Monica	 Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. (Monica shows him the tape then puts it in) have a little surprise for you.
197	Chandler	 well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NYC!
198	Monica	 Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love you. (She presses play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.)
199	Chandler	 (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
200	Monica	 Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
201	Chandler	 no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
202	Monica	 Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
203	Chandler	 does what always have to be sharks.
204	Monica	 Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
205	Chandler	 What's going on?
206	Monica	 sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
207	Chandler	 let ME be a part of this!
208	Monica	 I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
209	Chandler	 no they don't
210	Monica	 then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
211	Chandler	 OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn
212	Monica	 really?
213	Chandler	 yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
214	Monica	 I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They hug)
215	Chandler	 You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
216	Monica	 I'm very, very drunk right now.
217		(They hug, Scene fades to black)
218	[Scene	 Phoebe is in central-perk with Joey telling him what Ross said to her at the beginning]
219	Joey	 (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
220	Phoebe	 you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
221	Joey	 your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with her. end
