2	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the kitchen, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around the table writing on notepads, while Chandler is looking over their shoulders.]
3	Ross	 (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
4	Chandler	 No, no, no. No-no-no.
5	Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe	 Shhhh!
6	Ross	 What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
7	Chandler	 No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
8	Ross	 What? That's like insanely easy!
9	Chandler	 Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
10	Monica	 It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
11	Ross	 What? You forgot fourteen states?
12	Monica	 Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That’s true in so many ways, trust me, I’ve lived in one and been to the other.)
13		[Chandler's watch beeps]
14	Chandler	 Oh, okay, time's up!
15	Rachel	 All right, I got 48.
16	Chandler	 Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
17	Phoebe	 Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one
18	Chandler	 Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?
19	Joey	 Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
20	Ross	 Wow, how many have you got?
21	Joey	 Fifty-six!
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross is sitting in the couch doing Chandler's game. Chandler is sitting in his barcalounger. The girls are in the kitchen.]
24	Joey	 Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports team!
25	Chandler	 Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.
26		[Cut to the girls in the kitchen.]
27	Rachel	 (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?
28	Monica	 'Cause you invited your assistant.
29	Rachel	 Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
30	Monica	 Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
31	Rachel	 Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
32	Monica	 Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.
33	Phoebe	 Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)
34	Ross	 Done! With time-a to spare.
35	Chandler	 Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)
36	Ross	 You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
37	Chandler	 Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
38	Ross	 What? That's impossible.
39	Joey	 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
40	Monica	 All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
41	Chandler	 I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!
42	Ross	 No, just give me another minute.
43	Chandler	 Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
44	Ross	 This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
45	Chandler	 Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!
46	Ross	 You're on!
47	Joey	 (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
48	Monica	 (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know that your oven doesn't work?
49	Joey	 But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
50	Monica	 Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
51	Ross	 Pshhshhh!
52	Monica	 Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)
53	Chandler	 Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
54	Joey	 Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
55		[Chandler and Monica head out with some stuff. Phoebe comes out of her room with a bag.]
56	Phoebe	 Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
57	Ross	 Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
58	Phoebe	 Oh, it's not!
59	Rachel	 Seriously, it's moving!
60	Joey	 What the hell is in there?
61	Phoebe	 It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
62	[Scene	 Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.]
63	Monica	 Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
64	Chandler	 I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
65	Monica	 That's my pie!
66	Chandler	 Which smells delicious!
67	Monica	 Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
68	Chandler	 What?
69	Monica	 We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
70	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey are feeding the dog as the phone rings.]
71	Phoebe	 (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
72	Monica	 Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
73	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, who's this?
74	Monica	 Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
75	Chandler	 Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
76	Phoebe	 No, there's no dog here?
77	Monica	 Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
78	Phoebe	 Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
79	Monica	 I'll be right there!
80	Phoebe	 (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?
81	Rachel	 (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
82	Tag	 I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
83	Rachel	 Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
84	Tag	 We kinda broke up this morning.
85	Rachel	 Oh, I'm sorry.
86	Tag	 Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
87	Ross	 Ohio!! Thank you!
88		[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]
89	Chandler	 Huh! Where is the dog?!
90	Ross	 What dog? There-there's no dog here.
91	Joey	 Yeah that dog left!
92	Monica	 (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
93	Phoebe	 There's no dog in here.
94		[The dog barks.]
95	Chandler	 Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
96	Phoebe	 No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
97	Chandler	 What is it doing here?
98	Phoebe	 Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
99	Monica	 Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
100	Chandler	 Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
101	Phoebe	 That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
102	Chandler	 (gasping) Really?
103	Monica	 Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
104	Chandler	 Well, it still has to go, right?
105	Monica and Phoebe	 Why?
106	Chandler	 Okay, it's um…
107	Joey	 (interrupting him) Don't do it!
108	Monica	 Don't do what?
109	Chandler	 (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs.
110	All	 What?
111	Phoebe	 Are you crazy?
112	Ross	 Are you out of your mind?
113	Phoebe	 Why?
114	Joey	 Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
115	Chandler	 They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
116	Ross	 Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
117	Rachel	 Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
118	Chandler	 (scared) Is there a puppy here?
119	Tag	 You don't like puppies?
120	Chandler	 (to Tag) Okay, you are new!
121	Joey	 Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.
122	Phoebe	 You don't like ice cream?
123	Ross	 It's too cold.
124	Chandler	 Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
125	Ross	 (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
126	Chandler	 And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
127		[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]
128	Ross	 How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
129	Monica	 1250.
130	Ross	 Damn, I forgot you were here.
131	Phoebe	 All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
132	Rachel	 Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
133	Monica	 Yeah.
134	Rachel	 When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
135	Phoebe	 Oh, I'd say about a month.
136	Monica	 Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
137	Joey	 Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
138	Rachel	 Interesting.
139	Monica	 When it's your assistant, I would say never.
140	Joey	 All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
141	Rachel	 Huh. A moo-point?
142	Joey	 Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
143	Rachel	 (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
144	Monica	 Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
145	Rachel	 You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
146	Joey	 Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
147		[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]
148	Rachel	 Hey!
149	Tag	 Hey.
150	Rachel	 How are you holding up?
151	Tag	 Not bad.
152	Rachel	 Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
153	Tag	 Thanks.
154	Rachel	 So were you guys together a long time?
155	Tag	 A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
156	Rachel	 Now that she broke up with you?
157	Tag	 Yeah.
158	Rachel	 Yeah. Hmmmm.
159	Tag	 It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
160	Rachel	 No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.
161	Tag	 Why?
162	Rachel	 Because, uh—it has to.
163	Tag	 You have all the answers, don't you?
164	Rachel	 Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
165	Tag	 Hey, thanks for talking to me.
166	Rachel	 Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)
167	Joey	 (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
168	Tag	 What?
169	Joey	 (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)
170		Commercial Break
171	[Scene	 The Balcony, continued from earlier.]
172	Tag	 What did Joey say? I like you back?
173	Rachel	 Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
174	Tag	 Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
175	Rachel	 No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
176	Tag	 Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)
177	Rachel	 Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
178	Tag	 (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He points down to the street)
179	Rachel	 What?
180	Tag	 Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!
181	Rachel	 Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
182	Tag	 I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)
183	Rachel	 (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in too)
184	[Scene	 Ross' apartment, Monica and Phoebe sitting on the floor next to Clunkers basket.]
185	Monica	 Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
186	Phoebe	 (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
187	Monica	 Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
188	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay.
189		[They both get up and head for the door. Clunkers whines a little]
190	Monica	 Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!
191	Phoebe	 You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
192	Monica	 That's not gonna work.
193	Phoebe	 I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
194	Monica	 Hey! I didn't know either.
195	Phoebe	 Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
196	Monica	 Yeah, I knew.
197	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross lays a lot of small papers, shaped like the U.S. states onto the floor making a map with the states. Phoebe enters]
198	Phoebe	 Where's Chandler?
199	Chandler	 (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.
200	Phoebe	 Wash your hands!!!
201	Chandler	 How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom)
202		[Phoebe waves Monica in. Monica sneaks in with the bag with Clunkers in it and heads for Phoebe's room.]
203	Ross	 Hey! What's she doing back here?
204	Monica	 Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
205	Ross	 Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
206	Phoebe	 (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
207	Ross	 Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
208	Phoebe	 See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)
209	Chandler	 (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
210	Ross	 Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
211	Chandler	 Why not?
212		(We can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.)
213	Ross	 Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
214	Chandler	 Well, I, I should go in there.
215	Ross	 No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
216	Chandler	 Why not?
217	Ross	 Because you sent away the dog!
218	Chandler	 This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
219	Ross	 Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
220	Joey	 (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?
221	Chandler	 Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
222	Joey	 So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
223	Chandler	 Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
224	Joey	 Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
225	Chandler	 And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
226	Joey	 Ross, you need some help?
227	Ross	 From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!
228	Joey	 (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
229		[Time lapse, Ross still laying a lot out the states.]
230	Ross	 I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
231		[Joey stands up again. Rachel enters the door]
232	Joey	 Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
233	Rachel	 Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
234	Joey	 If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
235		[Rachel walks past Joey towards the couch]
236	Phoebe	 (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?
237	Chandler	 No, no he went for a walk.
238	Phoebe	 Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back!
239		[The dog barks, runs out of Phoebe's room and jumps onto the couch]
240	Rachel	 (gasps) Hi!
241	Joey	 Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
242	Phoebe	 Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
243	Joey	 You think?
244		[The door opens and Chandler comes in. Rachel covers the door with a blanket]
245	Monica	 Hi, honey.
246	Chandler	 Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
247	Monica	 What? Why, why would...
248	Phoebe	 (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
249	Chandler	 Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)
250	Phoebe	 We have good news, look who's back!
251	Rachel	 (uncovers the dog) Hi!
252	Chandler	 Clunkers?! Oh my god!
253	Monica	 That's right, she came back all by herself.
254	Phoebe	 It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
255	Chandler	 (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!
256	Phoebe	 Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believe her) I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
257		[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]
258	Ross	 Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
259	Chandler	 It's up to you.
260		[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.]
261	Rachel	 Oh, hi! How are you doing?
262	Tag	 I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
263	Rachel	 Oh.
264	Tag	 Thanks for having me over, you guys.
265	Ross	 Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
266	Tag	 Colorado.
267	Ross	 Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)
268		[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.]
269	Rachel	 Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
270	Tag	 Okay.
271	Rachel	 Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
272	Tag	 Um, I'm not.
273	Rachel	 Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.
274	Tag	 No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
275	Rachel	 Really?
276	Tag	 Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)
277	Rachel	 Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
278		Ending Credits
279	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, later that night, there is someone knocking on the door and Chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through the peephole, and opens the door.]
280	Ross	 Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
281	Chandler	 All right.
282	Ross	 (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!
283	Chandler	 You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross gets the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap it) You got Nevada twice.
284	Ross	 (pauses) I know.
285	Chandler	 Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
286		End
