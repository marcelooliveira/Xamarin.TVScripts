2		[The gang is walking to a newsstand late at night. Joey is anxiously in the lead.]
3	RACH	 Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.
4	JOEY	 I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
5	MNCA	 You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
6	PHOE	 Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
7	JOEY	 Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
8	CHAN	 OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
9	PHOE	 OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
10	CHAN	 Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
11	ROSS	 I don't want to.
12	RACH	 Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
13	ROSS	 Yeah.
14	JOEY	 Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
15	ROSS	 Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
16	JOEY	 No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
17	MNCA	 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking.
18	[Scene	 Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica comforting Joey at Monica and Rachel's apartment.]
19	JOEY	 When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
20		[Ross enters, depressed.]
21	ROSS	 [sullenly] Hiiiiii.
22	PHOE	 Are... are you OK?
23	ROSS	 Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
24	MNCA	 Maybe.
25	ROSS	 Don't toy with me.
26		[Fun Bobby (FBOB) enters from Monica's bedroom.]
27	FBOB	 Geller!
28	ROSS	 Hey, Fun Bobby!
29	FBOB	 Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
30	ROSS	 Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
31	MNCA	 You and me both.
32	FBOB	 Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
33	PHOE	 Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
34	FBOB	 Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
35	JOEY	 No, I'm alright man. Really.
36	FBOB	 No, I'm picking you up.
37	JOEY	 Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.
38	FBOB	 OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises their hands] I'm still gonna go.
39	MNCA	 OK, I'll see you later babe.
40	FBOB	 Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. [kisses Monica]
41		[Chandler and Joey are watching, Rachel turns their heads away from Monica.]
42	FBOB	 See ya. [exits]
43	ALL	 Bye! See you later!
44	PHOE	 Fun Bobby is so great.
45	MNCA	 Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
46	PHOE	 Half full of looooovvvvve.
47	MNCA	 And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
48	PHOE	 Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
49	RACH	 We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table, holding five empty wine bottles]
50	MNCA	 Really? I only had two glasses.
51	JOEY	 I just had a glass.
52	PHOE	 Two.
53	RACH	 I had one glass.
54	CHAN	 I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
55	RACH	 OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
56		[All look towards door Fun Bobby left through.]
57	ROSS	 Oooooh.
58	JOEY	 [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.
59	MNCA	 So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
60	ROSS	 Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
61	PHOE	 Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
62	JOEY	 Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
63	MNCA	 Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
64	[Scene	 Monica, Fun Bobby, and Phoebe sitting in Central Perk Rachel is serving them. She brings a mug to Monica.]
65	MNCA	 Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
66	RACH	 Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
67	MNCA	 [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.
68	RACH	 Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
69	FBOB	 [pulls out a flask] Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
70		[Phoebe and Rachel look uncomfortable.]
71	PHOE	 Um, cake.
72	RACH	 Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]
73	MNCA	 You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
74	FBOB	 Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
75	MNCA	 Bobby.
76	FBOB	 Yeah, OK.
77	MNCA	 Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
78	FBOB	 OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
79	MNCA	 So, what are you saying now?
80	FBOB	 I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. [they hug]
81	PHOE	 [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
82	FBOB	 I am gonna try and quit drinking.
83	PHOE	 [sad] Ooohh, why?
84		[Chandler and Joey enter.]
85	CHAN	 Hey.
86	JOEY	 Hey.
87	MNCA	 Hey.
88	PHOE	 Hey.
89	CHAN	 Guess who's back in show business.
90	PHOE	 Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
91	CHAN	 No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
92	PHOE	 Oh, no.
93	CHAN	 OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
94	JOEY	 Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
95	PHOE	 Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
96	CHAN	 Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
97	PHOE	 Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
98	RACH	 Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
99	MNCA	 [gasps] You have other friends?
100	RACH	 Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
101	MNCA	 What?
102	JOEY	 With a man?
103	RACH	 What? What is so strange about me having a date?
104	JOEY	 What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
105	RACH	 Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
106	MNCA	 What are you talking about?
107	RACH	 I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
108	PHOE	 But you guys came so close.
109	RACH	 Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
110		[Russ enters Central Perk. He looks like Ross, except for his chin and hair (it is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]
111	RACH	 Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
112	RUSS	 [sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.
113		[Everyone looks at each other in amazement.]
114	[Scene	 Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Estelle (ESTL) is speaking on the phone.]
115	ESTL	 Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? [a knock on the door] Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
116		[Joey enters.]
117	ESTL	 Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
118	JOEY	 Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
119	ESTL	 Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
120	JOEY	 No.
121	ESTL	 Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]
122	JOEY	 OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
123	ESTL	 Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
124	JOEY	 Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
125	ESTL	 Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? [pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. [hangs up] [to Joey] Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
126	[Scene	 Central Perk. Monica and Rachel at counter, Phoebe, Chandler, and Fun Bobby at the couch.]
127	RACH	 What's the matter?
128	MNCA	 It's Fun Bobby.
129	RACH	 What, isn't he sober?
130	MNCA	 Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
131	RACH	 Ohhh, OK.
132		[Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]
133	MNCA	 Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]
134	FBOB	 Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
135	MNCA	 Oh God, yes!
136	FBOB	 There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
137	PHOE	 That is funny.
138	FBOB	 I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
139	MNCA	 Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
140	FBOB	 Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]
141	CHAN	 Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
142	MNCA	 Oh.... my... God.
143	PHOE	 It's not that bad.
144	MNCA	 Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
145	PHOE	 OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
146	RACH	 Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
147	MNCA	 But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
148	PHOE	 Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
149		[Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]
150	RUSS	 Hi.
151	CHAN	 [turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
152	RACH	 Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
153	RUSS	 OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
154		[Phoebe walks up to Rachel, cleaning tables.]
155	PHOE	 Rachel? Um, hi.
156	RACH	 Hi.
157	PHOE	 OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
158	RACH	 Uhh.... waitressing?
159	PHOE	 Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
160	RACH	 [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?
161	PHOE	 [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
162		[Phoebe turns back around but Rachel is gone. Ross enters.]
163	PHOE	 Oh, my, oh!
164	ROSS	 What? What's wrong?
165	PHOE	 I, OK....
166	MNCA	 She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
167	ROSS	 Alright.
168	CHAN	 [to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross] Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
169	RUSS	 Hi.
170	ROSS	 Hi.
171	RUSS	 Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
172	ROSS	 Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
173	RUSS	 Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
174	ROSS	 A date.
175	RUSS	 Yeah, I'm her date.
176	ROSS	 Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
177	CHAN	 You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
178	RUSS	 Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
179	ROSS	 Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
180	RUSS	 Periodontist.
181	MNCA	 See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
182	ROSS	 Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
183	RUSS	 Ditto.
184		[ROss approaches Rachel at counter.]
185	ROSS	 I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
186	RACH	 Oh.
187	ROSS	 Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
188	RACH	 Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
189	ROSS	 Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
190	RACH	 Well, yeah, this is the deal.
191	ROSS	 OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
192	RACH	 Um, Russ, you ready?
193	RUSS	 Yeah.
194	RACH	 Bye.
195	MNCA	 Bye.
196	PHOE	 Bye.
197		[Russ and Rachel leave together.]
198	ROSS	 [upset] She's dating. She's dating.
199	CHAN	 Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
200	ROSS	 What do you mean?
201	MNCA	 Do you not see it?
202	ROSS	 See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
203	CHAN	 Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
204	ROSS	 ....................Yeah.
205	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is making marinara sauce and filling every container in sight. Chandler enters.]
206	CHAN	 Hey.
207	JOEY	 Hey.
208	CHAN	 Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
209	JOEY	 Well, the part's mine if I want it.
210	CHAN	 Oh my God!
211	JOEY	 Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
212	CHAN	 [not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?
213	JOEY	 Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
214	CHAN	 So, what're you gonna do?
215	JOEY	 Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
216	CHAN	 Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
217	JOEY	 I've never slept with someone for a part.
218	CHAN	 Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]
219	JOEY	 Sorry.
220	CHAN	 It's alright. Is she good-looking?
221	JOEY	 Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.
222	CHAN	 Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
223	JOEY	 I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
224	CHAN	 Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
225	JOEY	 Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
226	[Scene	 A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.]
227	WAITER	 Can I get you something from the bar?
228	MNCA	 Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.
229	FBOB	 If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
230	MNCA	 No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.
231	FBOB	 So the light went out in my refrigerator...
232	MNCA	 [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
233	[Scene	 Central Perk. Chandler is sitting on the couch between Russ and Ross, doing a crossword puzzle.]
234	CHAN	 Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
235	RUSS	 Dysprosium.
236	ROSS	 [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
237	CHAN	 And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
238		[Phoebe and Rachel are at the counter talking.]
239	PHOE	 You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
240	RACH	 What?
241	PHOE	 OK honey, you're dating Ross.
242	RACH	 No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
243	PHOE	 Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
244	RACH	 Steve... sleeve!
245	PHOE	 OK, noone is named Sleeve.
246	RACH	 Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
247		[They look over at Russ and Ross.]
248	ROSS	 [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
249	RUSS	 You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
250	CHAN	 OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
251	RUSS	 I know what your problem is.
252	ROSS	 Oh you do, do you?
253	RUSS	 Um-hum, you're jealous.
254	ROSS	 Of... of what?
255	RUSS	 You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
256	ROSS	 Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
257	RUSS	 Hey, you listen.
258	ROSS	 No, no, let me finish.
259	RUSS	 No, let me finish.
260	ROSS	 No, you let me fini...
261		[Rachel walks up behind them.]
262	ROSS	 Hi.
263	RUSS	 Hi.
264	RACH	 Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away]
265	[Scene	 Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Chandler at Monica and Rachel's apartment.]
266	RACH	 Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
267	CHAN	 No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
268	RACH	 I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
269	CHAN	 Me.
270	RACH	 Why would I have to sleep with you?
271	CHAN	 It's my game. You want the job or not?
272		[Monica enters from her bedroom.]
273	CHAN	 Hey.
274	MNCA	 Morning.
275	ROSS	 Where ya goin'?
276	MNCA	 Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
277	ROSS	 Ooooohhhh.
278		[Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]
279	PHOE	 What's with all the bottles of liquor?
280	ROSS	 What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
281	MNCA	 Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
282		[Three slow knocks on the door.]
283	RACH	 Oh God, even his knock is boring.
284		[Monica answers the door. Its Fun Bobby.]
285	MNCA	 Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
286	FBOB	 Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
287	MNCA	 Sure.
288		[They both step out into the hall.]
289	FBOB	 This is really hard for me to say.
290	MNCA	 Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
291	FBOB	 Oh, no, no, it's about you.
292	MNCA	 What about me?
293	FBOB	 I think you may have a drinking problem.
294	MNCA	 What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
295	FBOB	 Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
296	MNCA	 Oh... shoot.
297	FBOB	 Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
298	MNCA	 OK.
299		[They hug and kiss.]
300	MNCA	 Take care.
301	FBOB	 You too.
302		[Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]
303	RACH	 What happened?
304	MNCA	 Well we... we kinda broke up.
305	GANG	 Awwwwwwww.
306		[Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, and Rachel all exchange money.]
307	MNCA	 [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?
308	CHAN	 I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
309		[Joey enters.]
310	JOEY	 Hey.
311	GANG	 Hey!
312	ROSS	 How'd the callback go?
313	JOEY	 It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
314	CHAN	 So what'd you do?
315	JOEY	 Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
316	ROSS	 Good for you.
317	JOEY	 But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
318	PHOE	 So... and?
319	JOEY	 Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
320	GANG	 Allright!
321	JOEY	 Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves]
322		[Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.]
323	Credits [Scene	 Central Perk. Russ enters. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]
324	RUSS	 Hi.
325	CHAN	 Oh, hey.
326	PHOE	 Hi.
327	RUSS	 I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
328	CHAN	 Yeah, I'm sorry man.
329	RUSS	 Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
330		[Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]
331	PHOE	 Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
332	RUSS	 Oh.
333		[Julie... Ross's ex-girlfriend... enters.]
334	JULIE	 Hey.
335	CHAN	 Hey!
336	PHOE	 Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
337	JULIE	 Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
338		[Russ and Julie look at each other with love in their eyes. The music builds...]
