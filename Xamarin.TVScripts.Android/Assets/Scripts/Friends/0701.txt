8	Chandler	 Monica and I are engaged.
9	Ross	 Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.

11	Ross	 Where is she?
12		[Cut to Monica out on the balcony.]
13	Monica	 (yelling at the top of her lungs) I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m engaged!!!!
14		[Cut back inside.]
15	Joey	 Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.
16	Ross	 Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I’m gay! I’m gay!" Can I bring her in?
17	Phoebe	 Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet.
18		[Cut to Monica.]
19	Monica	 I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because I’m engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fianc�e will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
20		[Cut back inside.]
21	Chandler	 (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet.
22		Opening Credits
23	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from earlier, everyone is now in the living room drinking champagne.]
24	Monica	 Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that…I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—Damnit!
25	Chandler	 It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
26	Monica	 Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.
27	Chandler	 To Monica!
28		(They all say to Monica, clink their glasses, and drink.)
29	Phoebe	 So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical.
30	Rachel	 Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…
31	Phoebe	 Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
32	Rachel	 (To Monica) Yeah, you’re on your own.
33	Monica	 Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
34		(They all agree and start to go and get ready.)
35	Joey	 But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?
36	Chandler	 So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
37	Joey	 You guys don’t think I look 19?
38		(A brief silence ensues.)
39	Phoebe	 Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
40		(They all politely laugh and stop just as quickly.)
41	Monica	 Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!
42	Rachel	 Okay.
43	Chandler	 Okay.
44		(They all leave and Joey comes back in quickly.)
45	Joey	 (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
46	Phoebe	 Oh honey no, you ate it all.
47	Joey	 I was afraid of that.
48		(Walks out and after he closes the door Phoebe turns around and takes a bite out of what is left of his candy bar.)
49	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s bedroom, they’re getting ready.]
50	Monica	 (looking at her hand) Y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You’re not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)
51	Chandler	 Know what I mean?
52	Monica	 Yeah, but I don’t think we have time.
53	Chandler	 There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
54	Monica	 (lustily) Let’s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)
55	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, time lapse, Chandler is fully dressed and slowly walking out of the bedroom with a distressed look on his face.]
56	Monica	 (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!
57	Chandler	 (motioning with his hands) I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
58	Phoebe	 Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)
59		"First time I met Chandler, I thought he was gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
60	Monica	 Phoebe!
61	Phoebe	 If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.
62	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is looking at the foosball table.]
63	Chandler	 Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
64	Rachel	 Hey!
65	Chandler	 You look great!
66	Rachel	 (quietly) Oh, thanks.
67	Chandler	 You okay over there?
68	Rachel	 I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No, y’know what? Never mind, I’m gonna be fine.
69	Chandler	 Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
70		[Rachel exits into the hallway just as Ross is coming up the stairs.]
71	Ross	 Hey!
72	Rachel	 Hi!
73	Ross	 Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
74	Rachel	 Well thank you, you too.
75	Ross	 Thanks.
76	Rachel	 Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
77	Ross	 Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
78	Rachel	 Oh…
79	Ross	 You okay?
80	Rachel	 Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?
81	Ross	 You mean, we—you and me?
82	Rachel	 Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
83	Ross	 Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
84	Rachel	 Shake it off.
85	Ross	 I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.
86	Rachel	 No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
87	Ross	 Surely you can think of something good.
88	Rachel	 Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
89	Ross	 What?
90	Rachel	 Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
91	Ross	 Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
92	Rachel	 Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
93	Ross	 My hands?
94	Rachel	 Yeah.
95	Ross	 Yeah?
96	Rachel	 Uh-huh.
97	Ross	 (to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
98	Rachel	 Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had a bonus night!
99	Ross	 A what?
100	Rachel	 Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
101	Ross	 One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
102	Rachel	 Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
103	Ross	 No.
104		[Silence.]
105	Ross	 Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t.
106	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is playing Playstation, Crash Team Racing to be exact (he’s in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. He’s got the wool cap, he’s got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and he’s got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like they’re from the inner-city.]
107	Joey	 ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?
108	Chandler	 (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.
109	Joey	 So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
110	Chandler	 Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
111	Joey	 Come on man, really how old?!
112	Chandler	 Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
113	Joey	 Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
114	Chandler	 Joe?
115	Joey	 Yeah!
116	Chandler	 Uh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
117	Joey	 When? Today? Some, not a lot.
118	Chandler	 Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
119	Joey	 Don’t worry about that man, that happens.
120	Chandler	 It’s happened to you?
121	Joey	 Yeah! Once.
122	Chandler	 Well, what’d you do?
123	Joey	 I did it anyway.
124	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in her room.]
125	Monica	 Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren’t you dressed yet?!
126	Phoebe	 I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
127	Monica	 (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.
128	Phoebe	 Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
129	Monica	 Fair enough, now go get ready!
130	Phoebe	 Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
131	Monica	 I’ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating my—(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.
132		Commercial Break
133	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from before the commercial break. Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.]
134	Ross	 Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…
135	Monica	 (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
136	Rachel	 What?
137	Monica	 See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
138	Rachel	 Oh honey, but it is just about…
139	Ross	 It is! It is!
140	Monica	 No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!
141	Rachel	 What?!
142	Monica	 See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
143	Ross	 Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
144	Rachel	 Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
145	Ross	 Yeah!
146	Monica	 That’s true.
147	Rachel	 Honey I swear it we just kissed.
148	Ross	 It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
149	Phoebe	 You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
150	Monica	 Thunder being stolen!!
151	Rachel	 Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!
152	Ross	 Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!
153		(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)
154	Joey	 Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
155	Chandler	 (angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!
156	Phoebe	 What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed… (Points to Ross and Rachel.)
157	Joey	 What?
158	Chandler	 What?!
159	Joey	 You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!
160	Rachel	 No!
161	Ross	 Oh no!
162	Rachel	 No-no, it’s really not huge.
163	Ross	 And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
164	Monica	 Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?
165	Phoebe	 Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.
166	Joey	 Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
167	Monica	 Yes that would be lovely.
168	Joey	 You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
169	Chandler	 Yes, you can pass for 19.
170	Joey	 Really?
171	Chandler	 Yes!
172	Joey	 Seriously?
173	Chandler	 Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
174	Joey	 (gasps) I’m 30!
175	Rachel	 Joey, you are not! You’re 31.
176	Joey	 (realizes) Aww crap!
177	Phoebe	 Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
178	Monica	 Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.
179	Phoebe	 Why?!
180	Rachel	 Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…
181	Monica	 No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)
182	Joey	 Psss, that is whack!
183		[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]
184	Phoebe	 (she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding.
185	Joey	 Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don’t."
186	Phoebe	 Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.
187	Joey	 Wouldn’t she?
188	Phoebe	 Would she?
189	Joey	 Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!
190	[Scene	 Rachel’s bedroom, she’s pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens it a little to stick his hands in.]
191	Ross	 Guess who? (Enters fully.)
192	Rachel	 Hey.
193	Ross	 Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air…
194	Rachel	 What do you think Monica meant when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
195	Ross	 Still thinking about it huh?
196	Rachel	 Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
197	Ross	 (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?
198	Rachel	 I care!
199	Ross	 (tightening his tie) And so do I.
200	Rachel	 Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
201	Ross	 Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
202	Rachel	 Am I going to let you watch me undress?
203	Ross	 (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
204	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s bedroom, they are both getting undressed.]
205	Monica	 I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.
206	Chandler	 Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
207	Monica	 Paris?
208	Chandler	 We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
209	Monica	 Keep talking.
210	Chandler	 Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!
211	Monica	 I love you!
212		(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)
213	Monica	 (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.
214	Chandler	 Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.
215		(There is a knock on the door.)
216	Chandler	 It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!
217	Monica	 (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)
218	Phoebe	 Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.
219	Monica	 What?!
220	Phoebe	 Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
221	Chandler	 Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
222	Phoebe	 Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)
223		[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)
224	Joey	 They break your heart, don’t they?
225	Phoebe	 Y’know, I don’t really need their permission.
226	Joey	 Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
227	Phoebe	 Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.
228	Joey	 What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.
229	Phoebe	 They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
230	Joey	 And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?
231	Phoebe	 Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
232		[Cut back to Monica and Chandler’s room, they are making out again as there’s another knock on the door.]
233	Chandler	 Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!
234		(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)
235	Monica	 Yes.
236	Rachel	 Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?
237	Chandler	 What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
238	Rachel	 No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
239	Monica	 Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.
240	Rachel	 What?!
241	Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought.
242		(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)
243	Rachel	 Monica, what are you talking about?
244	Monica	 My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
245	Chandler	 (entering) Ahh, third base.
246	Monica	 It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!
247	Rachel	 Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
248	Monica	 (gasps) We had a caricaturist!
249	Rachel	 Oh!!
250	Phoebe	 (singing, angrily)
251		"Whenever I get married, guess who won’t get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
252		(Exits.)
253	Rachel	 Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
254	Monica	 And yet, here we are doing it again.
255	Rachel	 Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
256	Monica	 Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
257	Ross	 Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
258	Rachel	 All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!
259	Monica	 I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
260	Rachel	 I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
261	Monica	 Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
262	Ross	 Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
263	Chandler	 (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
264	Rachel	 (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
265	Monica	 I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!
266	Rachel	 Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!
267		(Ross tries to dismiss it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows Rachel.)
268	Monica	 (yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
269	Chandler	 Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
270		[Cut to Rachel’s bedroom.]
271	Ross	 Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…
272	Rachel	 We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.
273	Ross	 Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
274		(There’s a knock on the door.)
275	Rachel	 Who is it?
276	Monica	 (outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!
277	Rachel	 Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
278	Ross	 Oww!
279	Rachel	 Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?
280	Monica	 I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!
281	Chandler	 How is that ever going to happen?!
282	Rachel	 All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
283	Monica	 I know why!
284	Rachel	 No you don’t know why!
285	Monica	 Okay! Why?!
286	Rachel	 Because! Because I was sad.
287	Monica	 What do you mean?
288	Rachel	 Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
289		(Ross looks at Chandler.)
290	Chandler	 (To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me.
291	Rachel	 Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.
292	Monica	 (starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)
293	Ross	 (deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.
294	Chandler	 Thanks.
295	Ross	 (at the door) And uh, Rachel.
296	Rachel	 Yeah.
297	Ross	 What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)
298		Ending Credits
299	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is singing outside Monica and Chandler’s door.]
300	Phoebe	 (singing)
301		"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That’s right, I’m here all night, and Chandler will never get l…"
302	Chandler	 (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
303	Phoebe	 Oh thank you.
