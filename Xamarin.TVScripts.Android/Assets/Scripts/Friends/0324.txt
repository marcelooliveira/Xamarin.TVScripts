2	[Scene	 Central Perk, the whole gang minus Monica is there.]
3	Chandler	 Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)
4	Monica	 (entering) Hey.
5	All	 Hey!
6	Rachel	 How’d it go with Pete?!
7	Joey	 Tell us!
8	Monica	 You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
9		[Two guys walk over and interrupt her. They’re both names you’ve already heard. One’s Billy Crystal. Yes, that Billy Crystal from City Slickers. The other one is Robin Williams. Yes, that Robin Williams from Mrs. Doubtfire.]
10	Billy Crystal	 I’m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded. Do you mind if we... (motions to the couch)
11	Robin Williams	 Yeah, could you scooch?
12	Billy	 Yeah, move over just a little bit.
13		(Rachel, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey all scooch over to let them sit down.)
14	Robin	 Keep on scooching.
15		[cut to Monica telling the gang about what happened at Pete’s]
16	Monica	 So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
17		(Robin interrupts her again by complaining loudly to Billy as the camera cuts to them.)
18	Robin	 Why? Why?! What’s wrong with me?!
19	Billy	 What’s the matter?
20	Robin	 I have a feelin’... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
21		(The gang is now eaves dropping in on the conversation, and is shocked.)
22	Billy	 How do you know?
23	Robin	 Well y'know, he’s got access.
24	Billy	 Yeah.
25	Robin	 Y'know it’s that feeling you get, y'know?
26	Billy	 Like when you go bowling and you know you’re in somebody else’s shoes?
27	Robin	 That’s the one.
28		[cut back to the gang.]
29	Phoebe	 All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...
30	Ross	 What happened?
31	Monica	 (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...
32		[cut to Billy and Robin]
33	Robin	 Why is this happening to me?! I don’t know, maybe it’s my wound.
34		[cut to the gang]
35	Monica	 Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)
36	Billy	 So it’s-it’s not heeled yet?
37	Robin	 No-no, it’s ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me the cream? Is there any—Oh, there’s the cream.
38	Billy	 Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
39	Robin	 What is it, Tim?
40	Billy	 It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife.
41	Joey	 (to Billy) So you’re the gynaecologist?
42	Billy	 (to Joey) Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
43	Robin	 (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy) And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!
44	Billy	 Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)
45		[cut to the gang, they’re all stunned]
46	Phoebe	 So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
47	Monica	 (pause) I have no idea.
48		Opening Credits
49	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
50	Rachel	 So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
51	Phoebe	 No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.
52	Monica	 He didn’t ask me to marry him.
53	All	 Ohh.
54	Phoebe	 Well then definately don’t take his name.
55	Monica	 He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
56	The Guys	 Pete?!
57	Rachel	 Why?! What is it?
58	Monica	 I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.
59	Phoebe	 (intrigued) Oh?!
60	Monica	 Yeah, but without the costumes.
61	Phoebe	 (disappointed) Oh.
62	Joey	 And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.
63	Chandler	 Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are
64	Monica	 So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?
65	Ross	 Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
66	Monica	 What’s fish hooking?
67	Ross	 Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
68	Joey	 What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
69	[Scene	 Chandler’s office, he is just finishing a meeting with his boss.]
70	Doug	 So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team.
71	Chandler	 Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
72	Doug	 (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What’s your name?
73	Chandler	 Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...
74	Doug	 No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to leave) This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)
75	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is making reservations.]
76	Ross	 (on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.
77	Rachel	 Yes!!
78	Chandler	 All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
79	Ross	 (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?
80	Chandler	 Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
81	Phoebe	 Yeesh, what’d you do about it?
82	Chandler	 Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
83	Monica	 I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.
84	Joey	 Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)
85		(Ross throws his hands out in a “What are you doing?” gesture)
86	Rachel	 Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.
87	Chandler	 Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em.
88	Monica	 Okay, can we please go eat?
89	Joey	 Yeah. What are we getting?
90	Monica	 (to Chandler) Anything but stew.
91	Ross	 All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.
92	Joey	 Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
93	Chandler	 (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
94		(Monica, Ross, Chandler, and Joey exit.)
95	Phoebe	 Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
96	Rachel	 Yeah.
97	Phoebe	 Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
98	Rachel	 Oh, ah with who?
99	Phoebe	 Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...
100	Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
101	Phoebe	 You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
102	Rachel	 Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.
103	Phoebe	 Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)
104	[Scene	 A Gym, Pete is training for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, with his trainer, Hoshi.]
105	Hoshi	 You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
106	Pete	 I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
107	Hoshi	 It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!
108	Monica	 (entering) Hi!
109	Pete	 Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.
110	Hoshi	 All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)
111	Monica	 Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.
112	Pete	 Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
113	Monica	 Promise me you’ll be careful.
114	Pete	 I promise.
115	Monica	 Hey, are we still on for tonight?
116	Pete	 Yeah.
117	Monica	 Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
118	Hoshi	 No! No boom-boom before big fight!
119	Monica	 How ‘bout just a boom?
120	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe is there with Bonnie, as Rachel enters.]
121	Rachel	 (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
122	Phoebe	 Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
123	Bonnie	 Hi!
124	Rachel	 This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re Bonnie?
125	Bonnie	 I can show you an ID if you want?
126	Rachel	 Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
127	Bonnie	 Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
128	Rachel	 Oh, that must be it.
129	Phoebe	 (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
130	Bonnie	 Thanks! You too.
131		(Phoebe starts to leave, Rachel slowly follows, shocked about how good Bonnie looks now.)
132		[cut to outside of Central Perk]
133	Rachel	 (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.
134	Phoebe	 Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.
135	Rachel	 How could you not tell me that she has hair?
136	Phoebe	 I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.
137	Rachel	 (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
138	Phoebe	 Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
139	Rachel	 Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
140	Phoebe	 Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.
141	Rachel	 Why, does she have a bad personality?
142	Phoebe	 Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!
143	[Scene	 Chandler’s office, Chandler is bent over getting some water as his boss approaches.]
144	Doug	 Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of Chandler’s co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)
145	Chandler	 (to his co-workers) What is with him?
146	Phil	 With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy!
147	Stevens	 We never get smacked.
148	Chandler	 Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.
149	Phil	 Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
150	Stevens	 I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
151	Doug	 (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
152	Chandler	 No sir.
153	Doug	 There you go. (smacks him on the butt)
154	[Scene	 The Ultimate Fighting Championship, Ross and Monica are there watching Pete.]
155	Ross	 (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
156	Monica	 God Ross, what is that?
157	Ross	 Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
158	Announcer	 From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
159		[Pete enters with his entourage all pumped up, and Ross and Monica are the only ones who stand up and cheer.]
160	Monica	 I love you, Pete!!!
161	Announcer	 And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
162		(The crowd goes wild, and Ross is the only one boo-ing him.)
163	Monica	 (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!
164	Pete	 Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.
165	Ross	 Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
166		(Pete and Monica kiss, and Monica mouths “I love you.” to him.)
167	Ross	 All right! You go get him! Let’s go!
168	Referee	 Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, “Yes.”) Let’s get it on!!
169		(They both rush each other. Tank picks Pete up and carries him over and slams him into the fence surrounding the ring.)
170	Pete	 Uh-oh.
171		(Tank carries Pete over to the other side of the ring, and we see both Ross and Monica wince in pain.)
172		Commercial Break
173	[Scene	 The Arena, after the fight. Monica is walking up to a defeated Pete.]
174	Monica	 Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
175	Pete	 It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”
176	Monica	 I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
177	Pete	 What, look back?
178	Monica	 Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?
179	Pete	 Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
180	Monica	 Well, no. But...
181	Pete	 Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
182	Monica	 That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
183	Pete	 Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
184	Monica	 You didn’t know that already?
185	Pete	 Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
186	Monica	 Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.
187	Pete	 Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
188	Monica	 Yeah. That-that was the problem.
189	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's balcony, Ross and Phoebe are grilling some burgers and hot dogs.]
190	Monica	 (joining them) Hey.
191	Ross	 Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
192	Monica	 Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
193	Ross	 Hot dog?
194	Monica	 Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
195	Phoebe	 So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
196	Ross	 What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.
197	Phoebe	 Ohh, that’s too bad!
198	Ross	 No, I-I’m saying I liked her.
199	Phoebe	 Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
200	Ross	 Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.
201	Phoebe	 Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
202	Chandler	 (joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
203	Ross	 Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
204	Joey	 (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!
205	Ross	 Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
206	Chandler	 Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
207	Joey	 (sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!
208		(Chandler, Ross, and Phoebe all stop dead in their tracks at the news.)
209	[Scene	 Chandler’s office, Chandler is confronting his boss about the butt smacking thing. His boss is writing on a white board.]
210	Chandler	 Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
211	Doug	 (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?
212	Chandler	 No, I ah, I didn’t do them.
213	Doug	 Oh, you forgot?
214	Chandler	 No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
215	Doug	 Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!
216	Chandler	 Doug!!
217	Doug	 Hmm.
218	Chandler	 I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
219	Doug	 Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
220	Chandler	 No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
221	Doug	 Oh?
222	Chandler	 Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.
223	Doug	 Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.
224	Chandler	 Okay. (he starts to leave)
225	Doug	 Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out) Ahhhhhhh!
226	Chandler	 Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
227	[Scene	 The street outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are talking and walking.]
228	Phoebe	 Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
229	Rachel	 (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.
230		(We see Ross and Bonnie laughing and having a good time.)
231	Phoebe	 No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!
232	Rachel	 Phoebe! (goes back to the window)
233	Phoebe	 (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.
234	Rachel	 Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
235	Phoebe	 Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
236	Rachel	 Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
237	Phoebe	 You said it was okay!
238	Rachel	 You said she was bald!!
239	Phoebe	 What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
240	Rachel	 Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
241	Phoebe	 Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?
242	Rachel	 (quietly) Yes.
243	Phoebe	 Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?
244	Rachel	 Yes.
245	Phoebe	 So?
246	Rachel	 I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)
247	Phoebe	 (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
248	Rachel	 What?
249	Phoebe	 Oh, we killed them all.
250	Rachel	 Oh!
251		(They both jump up and wipe off their butts.)
252	[Scene	 A locker room, Pete is in a full upper-body cast. Monica enters, sees him, and gasps. Pete tries to turn around, and winces in pain.]
253	Pete	 It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.
254	Monica	 Please tell me you’re stopping now.
255	Pete	 I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. (stands up and starts swinging his arms) See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
256	Monica	 You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
257	Pete	 I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
258	Monica	 Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
259	Pete	 Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.
260	Monica	 Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.
261	Pete	 Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.
262	Monica	 Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
263	Pete	 Mon-Monica?
264	Monica	 Yes?
265	Pete	 Could you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)
266	[Scene	 Chandler’s office, he is just finishing up a meeting with his boss and the rest of his team.]
267	Doug	 So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8
268	Chandler	 Thank you, sir.
269	Stevens	 (coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
270	Doug	 Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?
271	Chandler	 No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.
272	Doug	 Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?
273	Chandler	 Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
274	Doug	 Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)
275		Closing Credits
276	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is watching Pete fight on TV. Monica is hiding in the kitchen, not watching.]
277	TV Announcer	 Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
278	Chandler	 Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
279	Rachel	 Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)
280	Joey	 Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!
281	Monica	 Really?!
282	Joey	 No-o-o!!
283	TV Announcer	 Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
284	All	 Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)
285	Phoebe	 Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
286	Ross	 Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.
287	All	 Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)
288		End
