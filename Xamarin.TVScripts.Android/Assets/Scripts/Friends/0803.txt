2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are getting ready to go on their honeymoon. Monica is entering from the bedroom.]
3	Chandler	 Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?
4	Monica	 Yeah I am!
5	Chandler	 (singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…
6	Monica	 That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.
7	Joey	 (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
8	Phoebe	 Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
9	Chandler	 I’d better go pack.
10	Monica	 Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.
11		(Joey looks at him, Phoebe tries not to smile, and Chandler is shocked.)
12	Chandler	 A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
13	Rachel	 (entering) Oh good you’re still here!
14	Monica	 Hey!
15	Rachel	 I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
16	Monica	 Thank you.
17	Rachel	 And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?
18		(Pause.)
19	Joey	 We know its Ross!
20	Rachel	 How?! How do you know?
21	Phoebe	 It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!
22	Rachel	 Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.
23	Monica	 This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!
24	Rachel	 I know! (They hug.)
25	Phoebe	 Me too! (Joins the hug.)
26	Joey	 I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)
27	Rachel	 (breaking the hug) You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
28	Monica	 Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood.
29	Rachel	 Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!
30	Monica	 Well, what were you gonna say?
31	Rachel	 Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
32	Joey	 Well that, that sounds good.
33	Rachel	 Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)
34	Monica	 Hey! Good luck!
35	Phoebe	 Yeah, bye.
36	Joey	 Bye.
37		(Rachel exits.)
38	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, what was that all about?
39	Monica	 Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
40	Chandler	 (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
41	Monica	 I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.
42	Chandler	 (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
43	Joey	 What secrets?
44	Chandler	 Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
45		(The girls walk away.)
46	Joey	 (whispering to Chandler) You’ll tell me later?
47	Chandler	 You already know.
48		Opening Credits
49	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are entering.]
50	Phoebe	 Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
51	Joey	 Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
52	Phoebe	 All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
53	Joey	 I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.
54	Phoebe	 What?! They took mine to give to you!
55	Joey	 Why would they take away our keys?
56	Phoebe	 Maybe they don’t trust us.
57	Joey	 No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
58	Phoebe	 You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?
59	Joey	 Hey, I washed those!
60	Phoebe	 No you didn’t.
61	Joey	 Yeah that didn’t sound like me.
62	Phoebe	 Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
63	Joey	 Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
64	Phoebe	 What stuff?
65	Joey	 Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)
66	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
67	Phoebe	 Did Rachel find you?
68	Ross	 No why?
69	Phoebe	 Oh she was looking for you.
70	Ross	 Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
71	Phoebe	 Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
72	Joey	 Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
73	Ross	 Oh no.
74	Phoebe	 What?
75	Ross	 I think I might know what this is about.
76		(Phoebe and Joey trade looks)
77	Joey	 Really?
78	Ross	 Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
79	Phoebe	 (deadpan) And?
80	Ross	 Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
81	Phoebe	 Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
82	Ross	 Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
83	Joey	 Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.
84	Ross	 Why? What-what else could it be?
85	Joey	 Oh wow, I don’t feel well.
86	Ross	 I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
87	Phoebe	 (To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?
88	Joey	 Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
89	Ross	 Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)
90	[Scene	 The Airport Ticket Counter, Monica and Chandler are standing in line behind another couple kissing who are next in line to be served.]
91	Ticket Agent	 Next?
92		(The kissing couple doesn’t move.)
93	Monica	 They’re kissing let’s just go around them.
94	Chandler	 Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.
95	Monica	 I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
96	Ticket Agent	 Next?
97	Monica	 (to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, "Next."
98		(The couple moves up to the counter.)
99	Woman	 Sorry. We didn’t hear you; we’re on our honeymoon.
100	Ticket Agent	 Oh, let me see what I can do. (Checks the computer) There are some first class seats available.
101	Monica	 (To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.
102	Chandler	 We are on our honeymoon.
103	Monica	 Grab my ass!
104	Ticket Agent	 Next?
105		(They go up to the counter.)
106	Monica	 Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.
107	Ticket Agent	 Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K.
108	Monica	 Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
109	Ticket Agent	 I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
110	Monica	 You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!
111	Chandler	 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?
112	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Joey are playing Rock ‘em, Sock ‘em Robots.]
113	Joey	 I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
114	Phoebe	 Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
115		(They hear a knocking sound coming from the hallway and go to investigate.)
116	Joey	 What the hell is that?
117		(They go into the hallway and see Mr. Treeger watching one of New York’s bravest breakdown Monica and Chandler’s door with an ax.]
118	Joey	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
119	Mr. Treeger	 You said there was a gas leak in here.
120	Phoebe	 Well why don’t you use your key?
121	Mr. Treeger	 Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key ring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman) Come on! Hurry up.
122		(With a final swing the door gives way.)
123	Phoebe	 Oh! We could have done that.
124	[Scene	 The Airport, Chandler and Monica are following the previous couple through a tiny hallway that proves this is a set on a sound stage and not an actual airport, and see them enter the first class lounge.]
125	Monica	 Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
126	Chandler	 No.
127	Monica	 Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)
128	Chandler	 Just act like you belong.
129	Monica	 Oh my God! Oranges!
130	Chandler	 Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
131	Airline Employee	 Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
132	Chandler	 Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
133	Airline Employee	 I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number.
134	Chandler	 Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
135	Airline Employee	 (grabbing the ticket from him) Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I’m sorry.
136	Chandler	 Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
137	Airline Employee	 Sir! I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.
138	Monica	 Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!
139	[Scene	 The Hallway Outside Ross’s Apartment, Ross is walking towards his apartment and sees Rachel sitting in front of the door.]
140	Rachel	 (seeing him) Hi!
141	Ross	 Hi.
142	Rachel	 Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.
143	Ross	 (quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They go inside.) Look uh, I know why you’re here.
144	Rachel	 You do?
145	Ross	 Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
146	Rachel	 (warily) Okay.
147	Ross	 Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
148	Rachel	 (confused) What?
149	Ross	 I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
150	Rachel	 Seriously. What?!
151	Ross	 Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
152	Rachel	 Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?
153	Ross	 Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
154	Rachel	 (touches his knee) I’m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you’re ready. (Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you’re the father by the way—but you got that…
155		Commercial Break
156	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
157	Rachel	 (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
158	Ross	 I’m good. I’m good.
159	Rachel	 Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)
160	Ross	 Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
161	Rachel	 I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
162	Ross	 What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
163	Rachel	 They do!
164	Ross	 No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
165	Rachel	 Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.
166	Ross	 Oh well I may as well have!
167	Rachel	 Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…
168	Ross	 Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
169	Rachel	 Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.
170	Ross	 No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, (picks up the phone) I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
171	Rachel	 Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… (Starts to leave.)
172	Ross	 (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
173	Rachel	 (stops) Okay.
174	Ross	 (on phone) Yeah I’ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to escape.)
175	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Mr. Treeger has finished inspecting Monica and Chandler’s apartment.]
176	Mr. Treeger	 I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak.
177	Joey	 (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)
178	Mr. Treeger	 Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door.
179	Phoebe	 Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
180	Mr. Treeger	 Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll find out anyway.
181	Phoebe	 Oh no.
182	Mr. Treeger	 (measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!
183	Ross	 Hi.
184	Mr. Treeger	 Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
185	Ross	 Sure.
186	Mr. Treeger	 Namaste. (Bows.)
187	Ross	 Namaste. (Bows.)
188		(Treeger leaves and Ross notices the door.)
189	Ross	 Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
190	Joey	 So it’s noticeable huh?
191	Ross	 Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
192	Phoebe	 Didn’t you two already talk?
193	Ross	 Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant.
194	Joey	 (simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!
195	Phoebe	 (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
196	Ross	 With my child.
197	Phoebe	 That is brand new information!!
198	Ross	 You already know don’t you?
199	Phoebe	 A little bit.
200	Joey	 How are you doing?
201	Ross	 Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
202	Joey	 Well, what did you say to her?
203	Ross	 Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
204	Phoebe	 Oh Ross.
205	Ross	 But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
206	Joey	 (shocked) What?
207	Ross	 I gotta go find her.
208	Joey	 Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
209	Ross	 Evidently they do.
210	Joey	 What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
211	[Scene	 The Atlantis Resort, Chandler and Monica are arriving to check in, but are behind the couple from before again.]
212	Monica	 I can’t believe we’re here.
213	Chandler	 Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
214	Monica	 What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
215	Front Desk Clerk	 As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
216	Monica	 No!! You have been screwing us all day!
217	Man	 Who are you?
218	Chandler	 We’re you just ten seconds later!
219	Monica	 Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!
220	Woman	 Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
221	Chandler	 (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
222	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Joey is on the phone and Phoebe is watching him.]
223	Joey	 Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.
224	Monica	 What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!
225	Chandler	 What else is new?
226	Joey	 Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.
227	Monica	 Well do something! Get in there!
228	Joey	 How? I guess I could break down your door.
229	Monica	 Yeah! Do that!
230	Joey	 And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs up.)
231	Monica	 No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!
232	Joey	 Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. (He hands the phone to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)
233	Phoebe	 Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (The chair breaks in half.) Okay, we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)
234	[Scene	 A doctor’s office, Rachel is on an examining table with her legs in the stirrups.]
235	Nurse	 Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
236	Rachel	 (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?
237	Nurse	 The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
238	Rachel	 Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…
239		(There’s a knock on the door and Ross enters.)
240	Ross	 Hi!
241	Rachel	 (shocked) Hi!
242	Ross	 Uh we-we need to talk.
243	Rachel	 Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
244	Ross	 Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
245	Rachel	 Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?
246	Ross	 What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…
247	Rachel	 Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
248	Ross	 Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
249	Rachel	 What married?
250	Ross	 Well yeah, I think we should get married.
251	Rachel	 What, because that’s your answer to everything?
252	Ross	 No, because that’s the right thing to do.
253	Rachel	 Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
254	Ross	 No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
255	Rachel	 Excuse me?
256	Ross	 Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.
257	Rachel	 What?!
258	Ross	 I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
259	Rachel	 I can too eat by myself!
260	Ross	 When have you ever?
261	Rachel	 When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
262	Ross	 Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
263	Rachel	 Oh please, you inhale your food!
264	Ross	 I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!
265	Dr. Long	 (entering) Am I interrupting?
266	Rachel	 Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
267	Ross	 But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
268	Dr. Long	 Huh. Nice to meet you. I’ll get started on this.
269	Ross	 (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.
270	Rachel	 I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
271	Dr. Long	 Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Ross and Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
272	Ross	 Oh my God.
273	Rachel	 Wow. There it is, I see it.
274	Dr. Long	 Congratulations. I’ll give you two a minute.
275	Rachel	 Okay.
276	Ross	 Thank you.
277		(Dr. Long exits and Rachel starts to cry.)
278	Ross	 Pretty amazing huh?
279	Rachel	 I don’t see it!
280	Ross	 What? What?!
281	Rachel	 I can’t see it!
282	Ross	 You-you just said that you did!
283	Rachel	 I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!
284	Ross	 Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there (Points).
285	Rachel	 Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now.
286	Ross	 Do you really?
287	Rachel	 No, I don’t see it!
288	Ross	 Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
289	Rachel	 Yeah.
290	Ross	 Sweetie that’s it.
291	Rachel	 That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
292	Ross	 You’re welcome.
293	Rachel	 Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.
294	Ross	 Yeah, that’s our baby.
