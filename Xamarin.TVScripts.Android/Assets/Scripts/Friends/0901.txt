3	Rachel	 Joey.
4		(He turns to face Rachel on one knee with the box open.)
5	Rachel	 (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
6		(Joey is stunned.)
7		[Cut to Ross getting of an elevator carrying a bouquet of flowers and walking down the hall to Rachel�s room.]
8		[Cut back into Rachel�s room.]
9	Rachel	 So uh�I guess we should�make it official huh?
10	Joey	 Uh� Look Rach�(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It�s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
11	Ross	 Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
12	Rachel	 Hey you.
13	Joey	 Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I�m really more of a candy guy. (Laughs.)
14	Ross	 You�re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
15	Rachel	 Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
16	Ross	 Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
17	Joey	 No.
18	Ross	 What?
19	Joey	 Oh, I�m sorry. I meant no.
20	Monica	 (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who�s here!
21	Mr. Geller	 Where�s my granddaughter? I�ve been practicing my magic tricks.
22	Chandler	 He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
23	Ross	 Hey, where�s uh, where�s mom?
24	Mr. Geller	 She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
25	Monica	 Oh, Aunt Liddy�s coming? That means we get five dollars each!
26	Mr. Geller	 So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve.)
27	Chandler	 Okay. Wow.
28	Ross	 Uh Dad, Emma�s in the nursery. I�ll take you now. If you want, but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.
29	Rachel	 I know, I still need to talk to you.
30	Joey	 Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
31	Phoebe	 (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
32	Monica	 About what?
33	Phoebe	 To see if know what these guys are talking about.
34		Opening Credits
35	[Scene	 Outside the Nursery, everyone but Rachel is standing and looking into the window.]
36	Monica	 Isn�t she beautiful?
37	Mr. Geller	 Look at her, my first grandchild.
38	Ross	 What about Ben?
39	Mr. Geller	 Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica, mouths) Wow.
40	Phoebe	 (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
41	Ross	 Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
42	Phoebe	 Yay! It�s so exciting! Wow, you could�ve done that with us there.
43	Ross	 Yeah right.
44	Phoebe	 Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can�t talk to Rachel.
45	Ross	 What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
46	Phoebe	 Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
47	Joey	 (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
48	Chandler	 Sure.
49	Joey	 Dude I just did something terrible.
50	Chandler	 That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
51	Joey	 No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
52	Chandler	 What?! Why does she think that?
53	Joey	 Because it kinda looked like I did.
54	Chandler	 Again, what?!
55	Joey	 Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand�
56	Chandler	 As we all are at some point during the day.
57	Joey	 It wasn�t my ring! It fell out of Ross�s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
58	Chandler	 Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
59	Joey	 I guess.
60	Chandler	 And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
61	Joey	 I know! I know it�s awful.
62	Chandler	 Well, what did she say?
63	Joey	 (happily) She said yes.
64	Chandler	 Does Ross know?
65	Joey	 Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
66	Chandler	 Well maybe you don�t have to tell him anything.
67	Joey	 Oh, I like that. Yeah�
68	Chandler	 If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
69	Joey	 (laughs) Now let�s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)
70	Monica	 I want a baby.
71	Chandler	 Honey, we�ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
72	Monica	 Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it�ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet�s still available?
73	Chandler	 I�m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
74	Monica	 Deal!
75		[Back in front of the nursery window.]
76	Ross	 Dad seriously! Y�know you really should see someone about that!
77	Mr. Geller	 Noted.
78	Ross	 I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
79	Mr. Geller	 Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
80	Ross	 (noticing something) Actually umm� (He turns Mr. Geller�s head to look at Emma.)
81	[Scene	 Rachel�s Room, Phoebe is entering.]
82	Phoebe	 Hey!
83	Rachel	 Hi.
84	Phoebe	 Are you all right?
85	Rachel	 Uhh� I think I just got engaged.
86	Phoebe	 Oh my God! He did it?
87	Rachel	 Well�did you know he was gonna ask me?
88	Phoebe	 Are you kidding? I�m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
89	Rachel	 And you really think this is a good idea?
90	Phoebe	 I just talked him into it, don�t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
91	Rachel	 I just don�t know! It just doesn�t feel right.
92	Phoebe	 Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
93	Rachel	 Really?! Even Ross?
94	Phoebe	 Especially Ross!
95	Joey	 (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y�know what? I�ll-I�ll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who�s entering.)
96	Ross	 Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I�ll guess just�I�ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)
97	Phoebe	 There he goes, your fianc�e.
98	Rachel	 I guess so.
99	Phoebe	 Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
100	Rachel	 I can�t say that I�m surprised.
101	[Scene	 A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a janitor�s closet door.]
102	Ross	 Dad, what are you doing?
103	Mr. Geller	 I think there are people in there having sex.
104		(Ross turns to look at Joey.)
105	Joey	 It can�t be me, I�m standing right here.
106	Mr. Geller	 Wanna peek?
107	Ross	 No!
108	Mr. Geller	 Come on!
109	Ross	 Y�know what? I don�t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)
110	Joey	 (To Ross) We�re not peeking? (Follows him.)
111	Mr. Geller	 Well I�m peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!
112	Chandler	 Hello sir, you know Monica.
113	[Scene	 Rachel�s Room, she is taking the ring out of Ross�s jacket, looks at it, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.]
114	Joey	 Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
115	Rachel	 Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I�it�s beautiful I love it!
116	Joey	 Yeah uh look Rach, there�s something I gotta tell ya.
117		(There�s a knock on the door and a nurse enters carrying Emma.)
118	Rachel	 Hey!
119	Nurse	 Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
120	Rachel	 Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won�t take my breast?
121	Nurse	 It�s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don�t worry. It�ll happen.
122	Joey	 (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)
123	Rachel	 Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
124	Joey	 Dear Lord.
125	Rachel	 I�m sorry honey, what were you saying?
126	Joey	 Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that�
127	Rachel	 Oh look, she�s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn�t she look scared?
128	Joey	 Y�know, I don�t really know her.
129	Nurse	 Why don�t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)
130	Joey	 (To God) Are you kidding me?!
131	Rachel	 It�s just so frustrating! Why doesn�t she want my breast?!
132	Joey	 I don�t know! Maybe she�s crazy! (Storms out.)
133	[Scene	 The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]
134	Phoebe	 Oh hey! Wait up!
135	Ross	 Hi!
136	Phoebe	 Congratulations! I didn�t want to say anything in front of Joey �cause I didn�t know if he knew yet.
137	Ross	 What, that we had a baby? Come on let�s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
138	Phoebe	 No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
139	Ross	 What?
140	Phoebe	 Oh, it�s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven�t done the secret thing in a long time.
141	Ross	 Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn�t propose.
142	Phoebe	 Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
143	Ross	 (pause) I am a doctor! Y�know what? I�m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
144	Phoebe	 All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she�s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?
145	Ross	 No! No, come on let her sleep! She�s so exhausted.
146	Phoebe	 And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
147	Ross	 What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we�re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we�re engaged?!
148	Phoebe	 Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y�know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
149	Ross	 I didn�t give her that ring!
150	Phoebe	 Really?
151	Ross	 No!
152	Phoebe	 So whose ring is it?
153	Ross	 It�s mine.
154	Phoebe	 Is it an engagement ring?
155	Ross	 Yes!
156	Phoebe	 But you didn�t give it to her?
157	Ross	 No!
158	Phoebe	 But you were going to propose?
159	Ross	 No!!
160	Phoebe	 Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
161	Ross	 Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe�kinda�wanted ah�start�things up again.
162	Phoebe	 Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
163	Ross	 Look, I didn�t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn�t want to either. But I don�t, I don�t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
164	Phoebe	 No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
165	Ross	 Well I didn�t! I didn�t propose! (Pause) Unless uh� (Pause) Did I? I haven�t slept in forty hours and�it does sound like something I would do.
166		Commercial Break
167	[Scene	 The Janitor�s Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to do now.]
168	Chandler	 Look, we can�t stay in here forever.
169	Monica	 Oh, I still can�t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn�t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
170	Chandler	 This is okay. We�re all adults here; there�s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let�s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
171	Monica	 Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
172	Mr. Geller	 Of course. I�ll always be your dad.
173	Chandler	 I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn�t for fun.
174	Monica	 It wasn�t fun?!
175	Chandler	 (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you�Wh-why� (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just don�t want you to think that we�re animals who do it whenever we want.
176	Mr. Geller	 Oh, I don�t think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
177	Monica	 The truth is, Dad, we�re-we�re trying.
178	Mr. Geller	 What?
179	Monica	 Yeah, we�re trying to get pregnant.
180	Mr. Geller	 Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) I�ll guard the door!
181	Monica	 Well, that�s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
182	Mr. Geller	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don�t think so! Aren�t you ovulating?
183	Monica	 Daddy?!
184	Mr. Geller	 Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That�s how I got my bad hip.
185	Chandler	 That�s funny, this conversation�s how I got the bullet hole in my head.
186	Mr. Geller	 This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was�
187	Monica	 Daddy! I don�t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
188	Mr. Geller	 You�re right, you�re right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
189	Monica	 I don�t feel good right now.
190	Mr. Geller	 But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
191	Chandler	 Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
192	[Scene	 Rachel�s Room, Monica is entering.]
193	Monica	 Hey.
194	Rachel	 Hey. I need to tell you something.
195	Monica	 Well, now�s a good time. I�m on my way to have my ears cut off.
196	Rachel	 Joey asked me marry him.
197	Monica	 What?
198	Rachel	 Joey proposed to me.
199	Monica	 Is he crazy?! You just had Ross�s baby!
200	Rachel	 Well, I-I said yes.
201	Monica	 What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross�s baby! It�s-it�s so inappropriate. No, it�s worse than that. It�s wrong. It�s� It is bigger than mine! (Rachel�s engagement ring.)
202	Rachel	 I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
203	Monica	 You can�t marry him!
204	Rachel	 Why not? I don�t want to do this alone! And he�s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
205	Monica	 Well do you love him?
206	Rachel	 Sure.
207	Monica	 Sure?
208	Rachel	 Yeah, I mean whatever.
209	Monica	 Honey, the question is�do you really want to marry Joey?
210	Rachel	 No. No, I don�t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
211	[Scene	 A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]
212	Chandler	 You still haven�t told Rachel you weren�t really proposing?
213	Joey	 No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
214	Chandler	 Joey, you have to tell her what�s going on! And what did it look like?!
215	Joey	 I didn�t look at it. Stupid baby�s head was blocking most of it.
216	Chandler	 Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
217	Joey	 Look, it�s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don�t want to hurt her.
218	Chandler	 Okay, look, just do it gently.
219	Joey	 You�re right. You�re right. I-I�ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I�ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.
220	[Scene	 Rachel�s Room, Ross is entering.]
221	Ross	 Hey.
222	Rachel	 Hey.
223	Ross	 Listen, I um� I heard about the engagement.
224	Rachel	 Surprised?
225	Ross	 And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um�I didn�t propose to you.
226	Rachel	 I know.
227	Ross	 I don�t think you do.
228	Rachel	 You didn�t propose to me. Joey did.
229	Ross	 Poor baby, you�re so tired. Rach, I didn�t propose to you, Joey didn�t propose to you, and Chandler didn�t propose to you.
230	Rachel	 Uh� You didn�t propose to me, Chandler didn�t propose to me, but Joey did.
231		(Joey enters.)
232	Ross	 Joey proposed to you?
233	Joey	 I can come back.
234	Ross	 Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
235	Joey	 No.
236	Rachel	 Yes you did!
237	Joey	 Actually, technically, I didn�t.
238	Rachel	 Well then why did you give me a ring?
239	Ross	 Wait! Whoa-whoa, you�you gave her the ring?
240	Joey	 No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
241	Rachel	 Yes, you did!
242	Joey	 No, I didn�t!
243	Rachel	 Yes, you did!
244	Joey	 No, I didn�t!
245	Rachel	 Yes, you did! And don�t you say, "No, I didn�t!"
246	Joey	 Ahhh!
247	Rachel	 He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
248	Ross	 Whoa! You were down on one knee?
249	Joey	 Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn�t�I didn�t propose!
250	Ross	 Then what did happen?
251	Rachel	 Yeah, what did happen?
252	Joey	 Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
253	Rachel	 Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
254	Joey	 No, I didn�t!
255	Rachel	 Yes, you did!
256	Joey	 No, I didn�t!
257	Rachel	 Yes, you did�Oh my God you didn�t! (Screams) Well then why didn�t you tell me that before?!
258	Joey	 Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
259	Ross	 Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
260	Joey	 (To Ross) I�ll tell you about it later. Be cool.
261	Rachel	 Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
262	Joey	 It wasn�t my ring! It�s Ross�s ring! That�s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
263	Ross	 What?!
264	Rachel	 You were gonna propose to me?
265	Ross	 Uhh� No.
266		(An awkward silence follows.)
267	Joey	 Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
268	Ross	 But I-I was going to see if y�know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that�I mean that-that was all, Rach.
269	Joey	 Dude, step up! I proposed.
270	Ross	 No, you didn�t!
271	Joey	 Oh that�s right. There�s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
272		(There�s a knock on the door and the Nurse enters carrying Emma.)
273	Nurse	 Hey, she just woke up! She�s hungry. Why don�t we give this another try?
274	Rachel	 Okay.
275	Ross	 (To Joey) I can�t believe you told her I was going to propose!
276	Joey	 I can�t believe you�re not going to propose!
277	Ross	 Hey, I�m not going to rush into anything!
278	Joey	 Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
279	Rachel	 Oh my God!
280	Ross	 What?
281	Rachel	 She�s doing it Look, she�s breast-feeding look!
282	Joey	 (looking at the ceiling) Ah, it�s beautiful.
283	Nurse	 I�ll come back for her later.
284	Rachel	 Okay.
285	Ross	 Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
286	Rachel	 Oh wow, this feels weird.
287	Ross	 Good weird?
288	Rachel	 Wonderful weird.
289	Joey	 Y�know what you guys? I�m uh, I�m gonna go too. And uh, I�m sorry about everything.
290	Rachel	 Honey don�t worry, it was my mistake.
291	Joey	 No, Rach, I should�ve told you sooner. It�s just that�Man! That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)
292	Rachel	 She�s perfect.
293	Ross	 We�re so lucky.
294	Rachel	 We really are.
295	Ross	 Look, I-I know it�s not a proposal and I don�t know where you are, but with everything that�s been going on and with Emma and�I�ve been feeling�

298	Rachel	 Yeah. (Laughs nervously)
299	Ross	 Okay, well, that� Wow, okay, well, umm�then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
