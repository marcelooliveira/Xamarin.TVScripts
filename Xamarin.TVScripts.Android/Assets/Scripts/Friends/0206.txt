12	Monica	 He hates me. My nephew hates me.
13	Ross	 Come on, don't do this.
14	Monica	 What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
15	Chandler	 Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. (Monica glares at him.) Joey, she does not look fat.

25	Monica	 Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi...
26	Ross	 Kiwi? Kiwi? You said it was a key lime pie.
27	Monica	 No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
28	Ross	 And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
29	Monica	 No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and...
30	Ross	 Ugh.
31	Monica	 Oh my god.
32	Ross	 Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
33	Monica	 Is your tongue swelling up?
34	Ross	 Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
35	Monica	 All right, get your coat, we're gonna go to the hospital.
36	Joey	 Is he gonna be ok?
37	Monica	 Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
38	Ross	 (sitting back down) You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
39	Monica	 Jacket now.
40	Ross	 What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
41	Joey	 We'll watch him.
42	Ross	 I don't think tho.
43	Joey	 What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
44	Chandler	 Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
45	Ross	 Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
46	Joey	 Hat, milk, got it.
47	Ross	 ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro throâ€”a thro thro!
48	Joey	 Consider it done.
49	Chandler	 You understood that?
50	Joey	 Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
51	Chandler	 Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
52	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is doing some cleaning as Phoebe sits on the couch with her guitar.]
53	Phoebe	 Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
54	Rachel	 Ok.
55	Phoebe	 (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
56	Terry	 Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
57	Rachel	 What's up?
58	Terry	 F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
59	Rachel	 But what about Phoebe?
60	Terry	 Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
61	Rachel	 Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
62	Terry	 Uh... (Points at Rachel.)
63	Rachel	 Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
64	Phoebe	 (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat...as needed.
65	[Scene	 A Street, Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben.]
66	Chandler	 You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
67	Joey	 It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
68	Chandler	 No, I got him.
69	Joey	 No, seriously.
70	Chandler	 Oh, seriously you want him?
71	Woman	 Hello.
72	Chandler and Joey	 Hello.
73	Woman	 And who is this little cutie pie?
74	Chandler	 Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
75	Joey	 You wanna smell him?
76	Woman	 I assume we're talking about the baby now.
77	Joey	 Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
78	Woman	 (She smells his head.) I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
79	Joey	 (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
80	Woman	 I think it's great you guys are doing this.
81	Chandler	 Well, we are great guys.
82	Woman	 You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
83	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel has just broken the news to Phoebe.]
84	Phoebe	 But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
85	Rachel	 Honey, I'm sorry.
86	Phoebe	 And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
87	Rachel	 Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
88	Phoebe	 Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
89	Rachel	 Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. (She goes over to Terry.) All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
90	Terry	 I, I don't know.
91	Rachel	 Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
92	Terry	 You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
93	Rachel	 Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
94	Terry	 Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
95		(Rachel goes back to Phoebe.)
96	Rachel	 Done.
97	Phoebe	 Really?
98	Rachel	 Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
99	Phoebe	 Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
100	Rachel	 What?
101	Phoebe	 Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
102	Rachel	 Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
103	Phoebe	 Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
104	Rachel	 Well, but Pheebs...
105	Phoebe	 No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.
106		[Time Lapse, Phoebe is on the sidewalk in front of Central Perk singing.]
107	Phoebe	 (singing, angrily) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....
108	[Scene	 The Hospital, Ross and Monica are waiting for the doctor.]
109	Ross	 Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
110	Doctor	 (entering) Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
111	Monica	 Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
112	Ross	 (to Monica) Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
113	Monica	 My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
114	Doctor	 No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
115	Ross	 Tho?
116		(Monica shakes her head.)
117	Ross	 Ohhh.
118	Monica	 That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
119	Ross	 Ok.
120	Monica	 Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
121	Ross	 Yes!
122	Monica	 Okay. (He grabs her hand.) All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! (The doctor puts in the needle.) Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
123	[Scene	 A Street, Chandler and Joey are still trying to pick up women with Ben.]
124	Chandler	 That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
125	Joey	 Hey, hey, look at that talent. (Motions to two girls waiting for the bus.)
126	Chandler	 (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
127		(Chandler and Joey run to get on the bus.)
128	Chandler	 Wait-wait-wait-wait!
129	Joey	 Wait! Wait!
130		[Cut to on the bus.]
131	Girl No. 1	 Hey, you. He's just adorable.
132	Chandler	 Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
133	Girl No. 2	 So what are you guys out doing today?
134	Joey	 Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
135	Chandler	 (to Joey) You done?
136	Joey	 Yeah.
137	Girl No. 1	 Oh, there's our stop.
138	Joey	 Get outta here. This is our stop too.
139	Girl No. 2	 You guys live around here too?
140	Joey	 Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
141	Chandler	 You know it?
142	Joey	 Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
143		(They all get off the bus.)
144	Girl No. 1	 So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
145	Chandler	 Oh, sure, they love us over there.
146	Girl No. 2	 Where's your baby?
147	Chandler and Joey	 (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben!
148		Commercial Break
149	[Scene	 The Street, continued from earlier. Chandler and Joey are still chasing the bus.]
150	Joey	 Ben!
151	Chandler	 Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
152	Chandler and Joey	 Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
153		(They run around and corner and see three buses pulling away.)
154	[The Hospital	 Monica and Ross are getting Monica's hand looked at.]
155	Monica	 Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
156	Doctor	 No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here (pointing to the X-ray) is the puncture wound from your ring.
157	Ross	 Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
158	[Scene	 Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is still singing.]
159	Phoebe	 (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. (A woman carrying a guitar case walks up.) Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
160	Stephanie	 Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
161	Phoebe	 Right. My name was on there (The chalk sign out front), but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
162	Stephanie	 All of them.
163	Phoebe	 Oh yeah, so you know D?
164	Stephanie	 Yeah.
165	Phoebe	 Ok, do you know A minor?
166	Stephanie	 Yeah.
167	Phoebe	 Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
168	Stephanie	 Yeah.
169	Phoebe	 Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
170	Stephanie	 No.
171	Phoebe	 Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)
172	[Scene	 A Street, Chandler and Joey are standing in front of a pay phone.]
173	Chandler	 (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. (Listens) Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character.
174	Joey	 (grabbing the phone) Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. (Listens) (to Chandler) He wants to talk to you again.
175	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is introducing Stephanie.]
176	Rachel	 Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to...
177	Phoebe	 (outside singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
178	Rachel	 Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
179	Stephanie	 Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. (singing) Zachary.
180	Phoebe	 (singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!
181	[Scene	 City of New York Department of Health Services, Chandler and Joey run in.]
182	Chandler and Joey	 Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
183	Health Services Guy	 He's here. (Chandler and Joey hug each other in relief) I'm assuming one of you is the father.
184	Chandler	 That's me.
185	Joey	 I'm him.
186	Chandler	 Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)
187		[Cut to a back room, Chandler and Joey run into it and over to two different cribs with two different babies.]
188	Chandler and Joey	 Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
189	Chandler	 Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
190	Joey	 Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
191	Chandler	 Ok.
192	Joey	 Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
193	Chandler	 Yeah?
194	Joey	 Yeah.
195	Chandler	 Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
196	Joey	 Ahh!
197	Chandler	 What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
198	Joey	 Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
199	Chandler	 Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
200	Joey	 You got a better idea?
201	Chandler	 All right, call it in the air.
202	Joey	 Heads.
203	Chandler	 Heads it is.
204	Joey	 Yes! Whew!
205	Chandler	 We have to assign heads to something.
206	Joey	 Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
207	Chandler	 What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
208	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is standing by the door and looking at Phoebe counting her money as Stephanie is singing.]
209	Stephanie	 (singing) Just call me angel of the monring. Angel! Just touch my cheek before you leave me. Oh baby. Just call me angel of the morning. Angel! And slowly turn away. I won't beg you to stay, with me.
210		(Rachel goes outside.)
211	Rachel	 Hey.
212	Phoebe	 Oh, hi.
213	Rachel	 Here. I thought you might be cold. (Hands her a cup of coffee.)
214	Phoebe	 Thank you.
215	Rachel	 Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
216	Phoebe	 Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
217	Rachel	 Do you?
218	Phoebe	 No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide," I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat," I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
219	Rachel	 Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! (Waves her hand over her head.)
220	Phoebe	 It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
221	Rachel	 Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."
222	Phoebe	 Really? From who?
223	Rachel	 Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
224		(A kid runs up, who looks like, or will look a lot like Phoebe's brother.)
225	Kid	 Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
226	Phoebe	 Yeah. Here you go.
227	Kid	 Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
228	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are sitting on the couch.]
229	Ross	 I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
230	Monica	 That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
231	Ross	 Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
232	Monica	 Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? (Points to her hand.)
233	Ross	 Oh.
234	Monica	 Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
235	Ross	 Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
236	Monica	 No. But I remember people telling me about it.
237	Ross	 I hope Ben has a little sister.
238	Monica	 Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
239	Ross	 I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
240	Monica	 That was you?!
241	Ross	 They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
242		(Chandler and Joey enter with what they hope is Ben.)
243	Monica	 Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. (She picks him up.) Hey, he's not crying.
244	Chandler	 (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.
245		(Ben starts crying)
246	Joey	 Yes! (Monica looks at him.) There's still pie.
247	Ross	 I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
248	Joey	 Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
249	Ross	 Ohhh. Big boy, riding the busâ€”Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
250	Chandler	 You, you are gonna love this.
251	Ross	 (to Monica) Will you hold Ben for a sec? (Hands Ben off and starts to chase Joey and Chandler.) Come here. Come here.
252	Chandler	 (picking up the pie) Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
