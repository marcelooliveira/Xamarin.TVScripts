5	[Scene	 Chandler's hotel room in Tulsa. He's fast asleep when the telephone rings.]
6	Chandler	 (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?
7	Monica	 (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
8	Chandler	 Honey, you're screaming.
9	Monica	 YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen
10	Chandler	 (yawning) Oh, that's great.
11	Monica	 Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
12	Chandler	 (clearly not so interested) Awesome.
13	Monica	 Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
14		OPENING CREDITS
15	[Scene	 Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]
16	Mike	 This is nice.
17	Phoebe	 I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
18	Mike	 You need both hands for that?
19	Phoebe	 Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)
20	Joey	 (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
21	Phoebe	 I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
22	Mike	 Is it?
23	Phoebe	 (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?
24	Mike	 Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
25	Phoebe	 (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
26	Mike	 Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)
27	Phoebe	 Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
28	Mike	 It's to my apartment.
29	Phoebe	 (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
30	Mike	 Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
31	Phoebe	 Oh no, I want to.
32	Mike	 Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)
33	Phoebe	 Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
34	Mike	 Is this cool, huh?
35	Phoebe	 It really is.
36	Joey	 (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
37	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing a nanny candidate.]
38	Rachel	 So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
39	Prospective nanny	 (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)
40	Rachel	 That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
41	Prospective nanny	 Not really.
42	Rachel	 Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)
43	Ross	 Thank you.
44	Rachel	 Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
45	Prospective nanny	 Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?
46	Ross	 Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
47	Prospective nanny	 That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
48	Rachel	 Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
49	Ross	 Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
50	Rachel	 (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?
51	Ross	 She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
52	Rachel	 Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
53	Sandy	 (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.
54	Ross	 And she's a little mannish...
55	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]
56	Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh my God! David!
57	David	 Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
58	Phoebe	 (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
59	David	 Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
60	Phoebe	 Who cares, it got you here.
61	David	 Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
62	Phoebe	 Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
63	David	 Damn it!
64	Phoebe	 A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
65	David	 Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes
66	Phoebe	 Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
67	David	 Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about
68	Phoebe	 No...
69	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe is pacing up and down the room.]
70	Phoebe	 I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
71	Monica	 Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
72	Phoebe	 He said
73	Monica	 Oh, well... That had been your window.
74	Phoebe	 Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking
75	Monica	 Really? The scientist guy?
76	Phoebe	 Really? Chandler?
77	Monica	 Continue...
78	Phoebe	 Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
79	Monica	 Phoebe!
80	Phoebe	 I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
81	Monica	 Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
82	Phoebe	 (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
83	Monica	 What are you gonna do?
84	Phoebe	 I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
85	Monica	 You have to tell David!
86	Phoebe	 Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
87	[Scene	 The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]
88	Chandler	 (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)
89	Monica	 Heeeeeey!
90	Chandler	 Hey!
91	Phoebe	 Hey!
92	Chandler	 So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
93	Monica	 (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?
94	Chandler	 (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
95	Phoebe	 Okay. (and she walks away)
96	Chandler	 What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
97	Monica	 No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
98	Chandler	 Yeah, he came up...
99	Monica	 Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)
100	Chandler	 (to Phoebe) Were you there?
101	Phoebe	 No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
102	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]
103	Sandy	 I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)
104	Rachel	 Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
105	Ross	 Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)
106	Rachel	 Ross!
107	Sandy	 It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
108	Rachel	 Oh!
109	Sandy	 Her name is Deliah.
110	Rachel	 Oh, that's pretty.
111	Ross	 (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
112	Sandy	 I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.
113	Ross	 (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.
114	Sandy	 Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said
115	Ross	 Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)
116	Rachel	 Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
117	Sandy	 Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
118	Rachel	 Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...
119	Ross	 Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
120	Rachel	 So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
121	Ross	 Because, it's weird!
122	Rachel	 Why?
123	Ross	 What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
124	Rachel	 (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?
125	Ross	 King?
126	Sandy	 I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)
127	Rachel	 (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.
128	Sandy	 That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
129	Rachel	 Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
130	Ross	 You gotta be at least bi...
131		COMMERCIAL BREAK
132	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler enters.]
133	Chandler	 Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
134	Joey	 Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
135	Chandler	 (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
136	Joey	 I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
137	Chandler	 Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
138	Joey	 Seriously? She actually said that?
139	Chandler	 Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
140	Joey	 Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
141	Chandler	 Yeah!
142	Joey	 Without that, you just got "lame with women".
143	Chandler	 Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
144	Monica	 Hi! There you are.
145	Joey	 (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
146	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of wine.]
147	David	 Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
148	Phoebe	 Oof...
149	David	 In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)
150	Phoebe	 Oh, wait, wait!
151	David	 Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
152	Phoebe	 No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
153	David	 Oh... oh...
154	Phoebe	 Yeah, I should have told you.
155	David	 No... well, yeah.
156	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
157	David	 Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?
158	Phoebe	 I am happy.
159	David	 Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...
160	Phoebe	 Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
161	David	 Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
162	Phoebe	 Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
163	David	 No... no...
164	Phoebe	 I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)
165	David	 In Minsk...
166	Phoebe	 Yeah?
167	David	 ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.
168	Phoebe	 Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
169	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away with handkerchiefs]
170	Rachel	 (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...
171	Ross	 (very worried) Is everything allright?
172	Rachel	 Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc�e and it was just sooo beautiful.
173	Sandy	 Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
174	Rachel	 I can't... I can't hear it again.
175	Sandy	 You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)
176	Ross	 And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
177	Rachel	 Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)
178	Ross	 Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
179	Rachel	 Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
180	Ross	 (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
181	Rachel	 What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
182	Ross	 (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
183	Rachel	 Sandy made Madeleines.
184	Ross	 This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)
185	Rachel	 Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
186	Ross	 Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
187	Rachel	 Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)
188	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the living room.]
189	Phoebe	 Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
190	David	 But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
191	Phoebe	 No, no. No.
192	David	 But... ergo...
193	Phoebe	 Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
194	David	 Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)
195	Mike	 Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)
196	Phoebe	 (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
197	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross enters.]
198	Ross	 Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
199	Monica	 Yeah! I think that's great!
200	Ross	 Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
201	Monica	 Oh... How are they?
202	Ross	 (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
203	Joey	 Hey!
204	Ross	 Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
205	Joey	 (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
206	Ross	 Thank you!
207	Joey	 That's like a woman wanting to be a...
208	Ross	 ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
209	Monica	 Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
210	Joey	 Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
211	Monica	 Yeah, so?
212	Ross	 Wow!
213	Joey	 Really? Do you not know Chandler?
214	Monica	 Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
215	Joey	 So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)
216	Ross	 Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
217	Joey	 ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
218	Monica	 I can't believe he's that upset about this...
219	Joey	 Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
220	Chandler	 Hey!
221	Joey	 Heeeyy! Hey!
222	Chandler	 What are you guys talking about?
223	Ross	 Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")
224	Chandler	 You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)
225	Chandler	 You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
226	Monica	 Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
227	Chandler	 If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
228	Monica	 Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)
229	Chandler	 What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
230	Monica	 Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)
231	Chandler	 Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
232	Joey	 Yeah....
233	Chandler	 So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)
234	Monica	 Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
235	Chandler	 Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
236	Monica	 Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
237	Chandler	 I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
238	Monica	 Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.
239	Ross	 Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)
240	Joey	 Not knowing when to shut up...
241	Ross	 Yep! That's my thing...
242		COMMERCIAL BREAK
243	[Scene	 Phoebe's apartment. David is still there. Mike closes the door.]
244	Mike	 So... how many guys have your key?
245	Phoebe	 No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
246	Mike	 Your lipstick's on his mouth.
247	David	 Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
248	Phoebe	 No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
249	Mike	 Did you uhm...
250	Phoebe	 No, no...
251	Mike	 ...kiss him?
252	Phoebe	 Oh, well, yeah...
253	David	 Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. (he points at Mike)
254	Mike	 Don't point your finger at me.
255	David	 Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
256	Mike	 Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)
257	Phoebe	 Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.
258	David	 Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.
259	Mike	 Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
260	David	 Oh, you're going to Minsk?
261	Mike	 Well, I might.
262	David	 Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
263	Phoebe	 Okay, well... guys?
264	David	 Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)
265	Mike	 Hey, what are you kidding me?
266	David	 Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. (and he leaves)
267	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
268	Mike	 It's never gonna happen again right?
269	Phoebe	 Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)
270	David	 I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)
271	[Scene	 Ross walks in the hallway to his apartment and stops in front of his own door. Now he hears two recorders playing a song. When he enters, Sandy and Joey are playing the recorder and Rachel listens.]
272	Joey	 Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
273	Ross	 Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
274	Joey	 Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
275	Ross	 (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)
276	Sandy	 Who's up for puppets?
277	Joey	 Me! I'm up for puppets!
278	Sandy	 Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
279	Ross	 Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
280	Sandy	 Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)
281	Joey	 I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)
282	Ross	 (shakes his head) Oh my God!
283	Sandy	 Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... (Ross goes to the kitchen)
284	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's kitchen. Ross got a beer from the refrigerator and opens the bottle. Rachel now also enters the kitchen.]
285	Rachel	 That was kind of rude!
286	Ross	 Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
287	Rachel	 You know, he was just doing his job...
288	Ross	 Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
289	Rachel	 Oh, come on Ross...
290	Ross	 No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
291	Rachel	 (sighs) Oh... That's true.
292	Ross	 Thank you!
293	Rachel	 Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
294	[Scene	 Living room. Joey and Sandy are talking with the Snufflebumps.]
295	Sandy	 (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
296	Joey	 (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
297	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Joey are sitting at the dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.]
298	Chandler	 Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http
299	Monica	 Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
300	Chandler	 Really...? See... that's the thing
301	Monica	 Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
302	Chandler	 I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
303	Joey	 Allright. See you later!
304	Chandler	 See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
305	Joey	 (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
306	Monica	 Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
307	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel's apartment. Sandy is knitting baby clothes. Ross and Rachel walk into the living room.]
308	Ross	 Here goes...
309	Rachel	 I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)
310	Ross	 Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
311	Sandy	 (surprised) Oh...
312	Ross	 Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
313	Rachel	 (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
314	Ross	 I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
315	Sandy	 Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
316	Rachel	 (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!
317	Ross	 Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
318	Sandy	 No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
319	Ross	 No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
320	Sandy	 What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)
321	Ross	 You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
322	Sandy	 That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
323	Ross	 Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
324	Sandy	 hmmm... (and shakes his head)
325	Ross	 I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
326	Rachel	 (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
327	Ross	 I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
328	Sandy	 That must have been hard.
329	Ross	 It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
330	Sandy	 But you are a real boy!
331	Ross	 I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
332	Sandy	 It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
333	Ross	 Here come some more...
334		COMMERCIAL BREAK
335	[Scene	 Joey's apartment. Joey and Sandy are sitting at the kitchen counter. Joey is holding mr. Wigglemunch, and Sandy holds the Grumpus.]
336	Sandy/Grumpus	 And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?
337	Joey/Wigglemunch	 What kind?
338	Sandy/Grumpus	 A friend-ship...
339	Joey	 Wow! You blow my mind...
340	Sandy	 Oh, I gotta go.
341	Joey	 Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
342	Sandy	 Twenty bucks.
343	Joey	 It's like the cheapest college ever.
