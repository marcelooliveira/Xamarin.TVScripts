3	Chandler	 Okay, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellent. . . about me?
4	Rachel	 So, how was the party?
5	Chandler	 Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. Okay, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
6	Phoebe	 No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everything.
7	Chandler	 Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
8	Phoebe	 No, not weight... y'know, more like insulation.
9	Monica	 Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
10	Chandler	 Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
11	Monica	 Please.
12	All	 C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
13	Chandler	 All right, Okay, all right. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
14	Phoebe	 Your boobs are fine. look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. (hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back) Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....

25	Chandler	 One. . . two. . . two and a half. Okay, just show me one of them.
26	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch. Rachel is working.]
27	Chandler	 (slowly lifts coffee cup to his mouth) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. (slowly sets the cup back down) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. (Joey intercepts the cup and puts it down for him). She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
28		(Phoebe enters.)
29	Rachel	 Hey Pheebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?

34	Phoebe	 look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
35	Joey	 Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
36	Phoebe	 No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
37	Joey	 Maybe he's. . . gay.
38	Phoebe	 Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
39	Rachel	 Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
40	Phoebe	 No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
41		(Monica enters.)
42	Monica	 (to Chandler) Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.

50	Chandler	 So you really Okay about all this?
51	Rachel	 Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
52		(Ross and Julie enter.)
53	Ross	 Hi guys.
54	All	 Hey.
55	Ross	 Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, Okay?
56	Monica	 Only if you say his full name.
57	Ross	 (reluctantly) Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
58	Monica	 All right.

61	Rachel	 Together?
62	Ross	 Uh huh.
63	Rachel	 Both of you?
64	Ross	 Yep.
65	Rachel	 Together.
66	Julie	 Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
67	Rachel	 Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
68	Ross	 Hopefully.
69	Rachel	 Well. (looks at watch) Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, Okay, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. (she leaves carrying her tray then comes back in) Okay, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
70	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Rachel is on her date with Michael.]
71	Michael	 I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
72	Rachel	 (distracted) How long do cats live?
73	Michael	 (confused) I'm sorry?
74	Rachel	 Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
75	Michael	 Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
76	Rachel	 That's just great. (she picks up her champagne and starts drinking)
77	Michael	 Um, cheers.
78	Rachel	 Oh, right, clink. (downs her glass)
79	Michael	 Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
80	Rachel	 Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
81	Michael	 Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
82	Rachel	 I mean he just started going out with her.
83	Michael	 Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
84	Rachel	 Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.
85	Michael	 All right.
86	Rachel	 Okay, Okay. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
87	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.]
88	Phoebe	 So, I figured it out.
89	Joey	 What?
90	Phoebe	 Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
91	Joey	 Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
92	Phoebe	 Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
93	Joey	 Pheebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
94	Phoebe	 You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. (they hug)
95		(Outside the window, Monica and Chandler jog up. Monica playfully pushes him. They start pushing and slapping harder and harder until Monica pushes him down. Chandler stands up, with a serious expression, and chases her away.)
96	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Rachel pours the last of the champagne bottle in her glass.]
97	Rachel	 (obviously drunk) I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruit flies, those things that live for like a day or something? (belligerently) What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
98	Michael	 Fruit flies?
99	Rachel	 Yes! Thank you.
100		(The waiter comes to the table.)
101	Waiter	 So, would you like any dessert?
102	Michael	 No! No dessert, just a check, please.
103	Rachel	 Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
104	Michael	 No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
105	Rachel	 Oh, Look at me, Look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
106	Michael	 Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
107	Rachel	 Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
108	Michael	 Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
109	Rachel	 Closure, that's what it is. Closure. (she Looks around the restaurant, spotting a guy with a cellular phone) Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel—woo (she almost falls out of her chair)

117	Rachel	 Thank you. Okay. (dials) (to Michael) Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
118	Michael	 Good.
119	Rachel	 (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket)

173	Joey	 I can't find the remote. (Phoebe turns off the TV) Thank you.
174	Phoebe	 So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
175	Joey	 And?
176	Phoebe	 And we did.
177	Joey	 All right Pheebs, way to go.
178	Phoebe	 Yay me.
179	Joey	 So, so how did it happen?
180	Phoebe	 Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
181	Joey	 And what did he say?
182	Phoebe	 He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
183	Joey	 Wow.
184	Phoebe	 Yeah, so I said, "Okay, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
185	Joey	 Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
186	Phoebe	 Um-hum.
187	Joey	 This man is my God.
188	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is closing up and Ross comes in.]
189	Rachel	 Hi.
190	Ross	 I didn't get a cat.
191	Rachel	 Oh, that's um, interesting.
192	Ross	 No, no it's not interesting. Okay, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
193	Rachel	 All right, I got it Ross.
194	Ross	 You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
195	Rachel	 (hurt) What?
196	Ross	 I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
197	Rachel	 Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
198	Ross	 Then you should have said something before I met her.
199	Rachel	 I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
200	Ross	 There was never a good time.
201	Rachel	 Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
202	Ross	 Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fianc�s or, or, or Italian guys.
203	Rachel	 Hey, there was one Italian guy, Okay, and do you even have a point?
204	Ross	 The point is I... I don't need this right now, Okay. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
205	Rachel	 Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
206	Ross	 Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
207	Rachel	 All right, fine, you go ahead and you do that, all right Ross.
208	Ross	 Fine.
209	Rachel	 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
210	Ross	 Good.
211	Rachel	 Good. (Ross leaves)
212		(Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.)
213	Rachel	 And ya know what, now I've got closure.
214		(Rachel slams the door and locks it. She sits down, visibly upset. She puts her head in her hands and begins to cry. Ross comes back and is standing outside the window. When Rachel regroups and gets back up to finish closing, she sees him. She smiles. She goes to open the door and can't get the lock undone.)
215	Ross	 Try the bottom one.
216		(She opens the door and they kiss.)

228	Monica	 (sad) Uh-huh.
229	Chandler	 And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
230	Monica	 Well no, but um.
231	Chandler	 I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
232	Monica	 Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
233	Chandler	 So, you feel like goin' for a run?
234	Monica	 All right.
