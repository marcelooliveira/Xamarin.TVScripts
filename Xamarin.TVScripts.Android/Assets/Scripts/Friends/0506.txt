2	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Monica and Chandler are making out on one of the chairs.]
3	Joey	 (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
4	Monica	 What?!
5	Joey	 Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
6	Chandler	 Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
7	Joey	 Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
8	Chandler and Monica	 Okay.
9	Monica	 Sorry.
10	Chandler	 Sorry.
11		(They wait for Joey to go into his room and close the door and then start making out again.)
12	Joey	 (from the bedroom) I can hear that!
13	Monica	 (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
14		(They both go to her apartment.)
15		(Pause.)
16	Joey	 I can still hear you!
17		Opening Credits
18	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are there as Phoebe enters carrying a large box.]
19	Phoebe	 Hey!
20	Joey	 Hey!
21	Chandler	 Hello!
22	Monica	 Hey, what's that?
23	Phoebe	 Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
24		(She puts her leg up on the chair and removes this huge knife from her boot to open the box with. The guys are shocked at the knife's existence.)
25	Phoebe	 Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
26	Joey	 Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
27	Phoebe	 Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
28	Chandler	 Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!
29	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
30	Gunther	 Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
31	Ross	 How come? Everybody else does.
32	Gunther	 You can't.
33	Monica	 What is that?
34	Ross	 Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
35	Monica	 (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
36	Ross	 Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
37	Monica	 So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
38	Ross	 Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
39	Gunther	 I'll take it all.
40	Joey	 Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
41	Ross	 Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
42	Chandler	 Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
43	Ross	 After what I did? Can you blame her?
44	Phoebe	 Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
45		(Ross suddenly gets up and heads for the bathroom.)
46	Joey	 (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
47	Monica	 Now calm down Joey.
48	Joey	 No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
49	Phoebe	 Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
50	Chandler	 Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
51	Monica	 Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
52	Joey	 No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
53	[Scene	 The Storage Room in the basement of Monica and Rachel's building, Monica and Rachel are looking for something.]
54	Rachel	 Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
55	Monica	 Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
56	Rachel	 I want the little round waffles.
57	Monica	 All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
58		(The single light flickers and goes out. Leaving the room in total darkness.)
59	Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
60		(She starts to run out but is stopped by a figure looming out of the darkness carrying a pick axe.)
61	Rachel	 Arghhhh!!!!!!
62		(They both start screaming at the top of their lungs.)
63	Monica	 Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
64		(Rachel grabs the bug bomb, activates it, throws it at the figure, and they both run out through the fog.)
65	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]
66	Phoebe	 I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
67	Joey	 I'll take it!
68	Phoebe	 That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
69	Joey	 Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right, what do you think?
70	Chandler	 You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
71	Ross	 (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
72	Joey	 What's the matter Ross?
73	Ross	 Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
74	Phoebe	 Why?
75	Ross	 Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
76	Joey	 That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.) Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
77	Chandler	 So you're really okay with this?
78	Ross	 Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
79	Chandler	 Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
80		(Ross exits.)
81	Joey	 Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!
82		(Monica and Rachel enter breathless.)
83	Rachel	 You guys! You guys!
84	Monica	 We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
85	Rachel	 It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
86	Monica	 And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
87	Rachel	 (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
88	Joey	 Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
89	Rachel	 Yeah!
90	Joey	 Yeah, you fogged Danny.
91	Rachel	 Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
92	Joey	 Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
93	Monica	 Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
94	[Scene	 Their Building, Monica and Rachel are going to apologize to Danny. Rachel knocks on his door, which he opens and he has this really bushy beard and long hair. Picture Paul Bunyan.]
95	Danny	 Yeah?
96	Rachel	 Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
97	Monica	 We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
98	Danny	 Okay.
99		(He closes the door. Rachel's not happy with that and knocks again. He opens the door.)
100	Rachel	 Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
101	Danny	 Okay.
102		(He closes the door again. Once again, Rachel knocks (harder this time) and he answers it.)
103	Danny	 Yesss?
104	Rachel	 Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
105	Monica	 Yeah.
106	Danny	 O-kay!
107		(He closes the door before Rachel can say anything.)
108	Monica	 Wow! That guy is so rude!
109	Rachel	 Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
110	Monica	 Well you did a little bit.
111	Rachel	 Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
112	Monica	 I totally forgive you!
113	Rachel	 Really?
114	Monica	 Yes!
115	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica is making a drink as Phoebe enters with the fur coat.]
116	Phoebe	 Hey!
117	Monica	 Hey!
118	Phoebe	 So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
119	Monica	 Crematorium Chris? Sure!
120	Phoebe	 He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
121		(Rachel enters from the bathroom and sees the coat.)
122	Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
123	Monica	 Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
124	Rachel	 What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
125	Phoebe	 This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the mirror.) 'Cause I do.
126	[Scene	 Ross's Apartment, the gang is helping Ross move out by carrying boxes. Chandler has picked a particularly large and apparently heavy box, because he takes a running start at it and still can't budge it.]
127	Ross	 (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)
128	Chandler	 Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
129	Ross	 No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
130	Chandler	 So, rocks.
131		(He picks up a smaller box and carries it to the moving van as Joey returns.)
132	Ross	 I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. (Points.)
133	Joey	 Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?
134	Ross	 I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
135	Joey	 Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
136	Ross	 Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…
137	Joey	 You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
138	Ross	 Why?
139	Joey	 It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
140	Ross	 What's going on?
141	Joey	 We all hate Emily!
142	Phoebe	 Nooo!!
143	Monica	 No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
144	Joey	 Yeah!
145	Chandler	 Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
146	Joey	 Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
147	Ross	 Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
148	Phoebe	 I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
149		Commercial Break
150	[Scene	 Central Perk, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are recovering from Ross's rebuke.]
151	Monica	 God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
152	Phoebe	 Oh, I know.
153	Joey	 I kinda feel like it's my fault.
154		(Monica and Chandler turn and stare at him.)
155	Chandler	 Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
156	Joey	 Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)
157	Chandler	 Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
158		(Monica pats Joey on the shoulder.)
159	Phoebe	 All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)
160	Chandler	 Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
161	Phoebe	 Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
162	[Scene	 Their building's lobby, Danny is checking his mailbox as Rachel enters carrying shopping bags and goes to her mailbox. Danny has shaved his beard and cut his hair, Rachel doesn't recognize him.]
163	Rachel	 Hi!
164	Danny	 So you like the short hair better.
165	Rachel	 What? Yeti—I mean Danny?
166	Danny	 I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
167	Rachel	 Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.
168	Danny	 Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
169	Rachel	 (shocked) What?
170	Danny	 That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)
171	Rachel	 What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
172	Danny	 Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
173	Rachel	 So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
174	Danny	 Do you?
175	Rachel	 Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
176	Danny	 Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)
177	Rachel	 And stop saying that! I hate that!
178	Danny	 Okay!
179		(Rachel decides not to give up that easily and follows him to his apartment and bangs on the door, which he opens.)
180	Rachel	 Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
181	Danny	 The pizza-place across the street any good?
182	Rachel	 What?!
183	Danny	 I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
184	Rachel	 Okay. Okay.
185	Danny	 Stop saying that. I hate that.
186	[Scene	 Ross's now empty apartment, he is spackling some holes shut as the gang comes to apologize.]
187	Chandler	 Uh, Ross?
188	Phoebe	 Are you still mad at us?
189	Ross	 Yep.
190	Phoebe	 Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
191	Ross	 Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
192	Joey	 Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
193	Chandler	 Yeah, we are so sorry.
194	Phoebe	 (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play but is stopped by…)
195	Joey	 Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
196	Monica	 Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
197	Phoebe	 Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
198	Ross	 Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
199	Phoebe	 Yes! Exactly! And that's why…
200		(She starts to play her song, but is stopped by Monica.)
201	Monica	 Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
202	Ross	 Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
203	Phoebe	 Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
204	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Rachel, are getting ready for dinner.]
205	Joey	 Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
206	Ross	 You do, huh?
207	Joey	 Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…
208	Ross	 What are you talking about?
209	Joey	 (thinks) I'm not sure.
210	Rachel	 (entering) Hi!
211	Monica	 Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
212	Rachel	 Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
213	Monica	 How did that happen?
214	Rachel	 That yeti is one smooth talker.
215	Monica	 I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
216	Rachel	 Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
217	All	 No! Why?
218	Rachel	 Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.
219	Ross	 Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
220	Rachel	 Ross, I…
221	Joey	 RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
222	Rachel	 Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
223	Joey	 All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…
224		[Time lapse, dinner is now finished and Ross is looking out the window.]
225	Ross	 Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
226		(They all run over to the window.)
227	Rachel	 I haven't seen him in so long!
228	Phoebe	 Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
229		(Pause.)
230	Monica	 Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
231	Joey	 It's almost as if he knew.
232		(The phone rings.)
233	Monica	 I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)
234	Ross	 Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
235		(Ross puts her on speakerphone.)
236	Phoebe	 Hi Emily!
237	Chandler	 Hi!
238	Emily	 Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
239	Joey	 Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
240	Emily	 (laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
241		(Rachel waves her hands in disgust and starts to head for her room.)
242	Ross	 Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
243	Emily	 She's there?!
244	Chandler	 Oh yeah, there-there she is!
245	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, she's here.
246	Emily	 Ross, take me off speakerphone.
247		(He does so.)
248	Ross	 (on phone) Hi.
249	Emily	 How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
250	Ross	 (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
251	Emily	 You obviously can't keep away from her.
252	Ross	 Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
253	Emily	 I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
254	Ross	 Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
255	Emily	 You're right.
256	Ross	 So, can you trust me?
257		(Pause.)
258	Emily	 No.
259		(Ross lowers his head.)
260		[Cut to the inside of the apartment.]
261	Joey	 I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
262	Monica	 How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
263	Joey	 You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)
264	Ross	 Well, I guess that's it.
265	All	 Why, what happened?
266	Joey	 What happened? What happened?
267	Ross	 My marriage is over.
268	All	 What?!
269	Monica	 Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
270	Phoebe	 Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
271	Rachel	 Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
272	Ross	 Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
273		Ending Credits
274	[Scene	 A curbside newsstand, Phoebe is whistling and walking up to it wearing her fur coat. She stops and starts to look through a magazine and notices a squirrel on a nearby tree chirping at her.]
275	Phoebe	 (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here. (She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!
