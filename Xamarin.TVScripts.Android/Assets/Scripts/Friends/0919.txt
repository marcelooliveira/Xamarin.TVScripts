3	Joey	 (talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
4		(Rachel comes out of her room and starts staring at him unseen)
5	Joey	 I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
6	Rachel	 I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less.
7	Joey	 Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
8	Rachel	 Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
9	Joey	 Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
10	Rachel	 (excited) Are you serious?
11	Joey	 Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
12	Rachel	 Hey, that was an honest mistake!
13	Joey	 Right!(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)
14	Rachel	 Yeah, that was an awesome day!

17	Monica	 Hey!
18	Phoebe	 Hey!
19	Ross	 Hi!
20	Monica	 So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
21	Phoebe	 Sure!
22	Ross	 I'd love to!
23	Monica	 Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
24	Phoebe	 Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
25	Ross	 Phoebe, what happened?
26	Phoebe	 Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
27		(Chandler enters)
28	Chandler	 (To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
29	Phoebe	 Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
30	Chandler	 What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
31	Phoebe	 Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
32	Chandler	 So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
33	Monica	 Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
34	Chandler	 Are you really that busy?
35	Monica	 Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
36	Chandler	 Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?"
37	Monica	 Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
38	Phoebe	 And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
39	Chandler	 (on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
40	Ross	 Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
41	Chandler	 I don't have travel insurance.
42	Ross	 Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
43	Monica	 Why don't you take Ross?
44	Ross	 Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
45	Monica	 No, not if their room has two beds!
46	Ross	 (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
47	[Scene	 Days of Our Lives' Studios]
48	Rachel	 Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
49	Joey	 I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
50	Rachel	 Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
51	Joey	 Also so gay!
52	Rachel	 Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
53	Joey	 Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
54	Director	 Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
55	Joey	 Oh, wish me luck!
56	Rachel	 Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
57	Joey	 Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
58	Rachel	 Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)
59	Director	 On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
60		(the scene starts.Joey enters and there's a girl wearing a wedding dress near a bed)
61	Actress/Olivia	 Drake! What are you doing in here?
62	Joey/Drake	 Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
63	Actress/Olivia	 Get out!
64	Joey/Drake	 You don't love him!
65	Actress/Olivia	 What do you know about love?
66	Joey/Drake	 I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
67	Actress/Olivia	 That kiss never happened.
68	Joey/Drake	 Oh, what about this one.
69		(the actress slaps him)
70	Rachel	 (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!
71	Actress/Olivia	 No, I told you...get out!
72	Joey/Drake	 Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
73	Chase Lassiter	 (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we...
74	Rachel	 SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
75	Joey/Drake	 Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
76	Actress/Olivia	 I don't have a choice...
77	Joey/Drake	 Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
78	Actress/Olivia	 Don't say that...
79	Joey/Drake	 Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)
80	Director	 CUT!
81	Rachel	 NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
82	[Scene	 Monica's restaurant]
83	1st Customer	 Everything was delicious!
84	Monica	 Thank you!
85	2nd Customer	 It was. The duck in particular was superb.
86	Monica	 Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
87	3rd Customer	 Actually I do have one small complaint.
88	Monica	 Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
89	3rd Customer	 The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
90	Monica	 What musician?
91	[Scene	 Outside the restaurant]
92	Phoebe	 (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ol√®!
93	Monica	 What are you doing here!
94	Phoebe	 Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
95	Monica	 Great!
96	Phoebe	 Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
97	Monica	 Listen Phoebe...
98	Phoebe	 Yeah.
99	Monica	 You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
100	Phoebe	 But what?
101	Monica	 This is kind of a classy place.
102	Phoebe	 (pause) Ok, say no more.
103	[Time lapse	 Phoebe in front of restaurant again]
104	Phoebe	 (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing)
105		(Monica covers her face with her hands)
106	[Scene	 hall of the romantic inn in Vermont]
107	Chandler	 Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
108	Receptionist	 Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
109	Chandler	 New York.
110	Ross	 (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
111	Chandler	 I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
112	Ross	 Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
113	Receptionist	 I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
114	Chandler	 Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
115	Ross	 (high pitched voice) Check again please!
116	Receptionist	 I'm sorry, it's not here.
117	Ross	 Not there.
118	Chandler	 Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
119	Receptionist	 I don't know what to say.
120	Ross	 (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
121	Chandler	 Just give us the cheapest room you have.
122	Receptionist	 Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
123	Chandler	 That's insane!
124	Ross	 Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
125	Chandler	 Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
126	Receptionist	 Great.
127	Chandler	 (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
128	Ross	 Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
129	Chandler	 Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
130	Ross	 C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
131	Chandler	 Dude, you're shaking!
132	Ross	 I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
133	[Scene	 Joey's apartment]
134	Rachel	 Hi!
135	Joey	 Hey!
136	Rachel	 Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
137	Joey	 Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
138	Rachel	 God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
139	Joey	 Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
140	Rachel	 Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
141	Joey	 Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
142	Rachel	 Oh screw her, that part is mine!
143	Joey	 Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
144	Rachel	 Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
145	Joey/Drake	 I can't believe you married him.
146	Rachel/actress	 But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
147	Joey/Drake	 So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
148	Rachel/actress	 It's over! You have to accept that.
149	Joey/Drake	 How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
150	Rachel	 (pause) Kiss me.
151	Joey	 What?
152	Rachel	 Kiss me.
153	Joey	 Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
154	Rachel	 No, I'm saying...
155	Joey	 but, but..
156	Rachel	 just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
157	[Scene	 Rachel's bedroom]
158	Rachel	 (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!
159	[Scene	 Hotel's room]
160	Ross	 (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
161		(Chandler enters the room)
162	Ross	 What did you get?
163	Chandler	 USA Today
164	Ross	 Nice, put it with the others.
165	Chandler	 And I also got... two more apples.
166	Ross	 We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
167	Chandler	 I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
168	Ross	 Oh, that's not cool.
169	Chandlers	 Dude, none of this is cool.
170	Ross	 No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example
171	Chandler	 I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
172	Ross	 Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
173	Chandler	 Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
174	Ross	 No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
175	Chandler	 Yes, but the batteries...
176		(Ross claps his hands)
177	Chandler	 Thank you, thank you very much!
178	Ross	 Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
179	Chandler	 No!
180	Ross	 At least tell me where you hid it.
181	[Scene	 Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]
182	Rachel	 Can I ask you a question?
183	Monica	 Yeah.
184	Rachel	 Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
185	Monica	 Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
186	Rachel	 Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
187	Monica	 Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
188	Rachel	 Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
189	Monica	 What do you think brought than on?
190	Rachel	 I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
191	Monica	 A love scene? With who?
192	Rachel	 Olivia.
193	Monica	 Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.
194	Rachel	 So do you think that my dream means anything?
195	Monica	 I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
196	Rachel	 Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
197	Monica	 Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
198	Rachel	 You took the same class twice.
199	Monica	 It was hard!
200		(Phoebe comes in)
201	Phoebe	 Hey!
202	Rachel and Monica	 Hi.
203	Phoebe	 Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
204	Monica	 Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
205	Phoebe	 Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
206	Monica	 Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
207	Phoebe	 Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
208		(silence)
209	Rachel	 Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
210	Phoebe	 My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
211	Rachel	 Ok, we're still on that.
212	Monica	 I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
213	Phoebe	 Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
214	Monica	 Tiny portions?
215	Phoebe	 Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"!
216	Monica	 Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
217	Phoebe	 Well...it's not about quality.
218	Monica	 Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
219	Phoebe	 Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
220	Monica	 Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
221	Phoebe	 Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
222	Monica	 You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
223	Phoebe	 What are people having, the garlic Martini?
224	[Scene	 Hotel's reception]
225	Receptionist	 Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
226	Chandler	 Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
227		(the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)
228	Chandler	 Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
229	Ross	 Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
230		(they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)
231	Ross	 Oh my god.
232	Chandler	 What?
233	Ross	 There's something new in the bowl.
234	Chandler	 Look, we have enough, just walk away.
235	Ross	 No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
236	Chandler	 There's a forest right outside.
237	Ross	 It's not the same.
238	Chandler	 Ok, go quick!
239		(Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)
240	Ross	 (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
241		(he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)
242	Ross	 Oh, my maple candy!
243	[Scene	 In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]
244	Phoebe	 (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
245		(Monica comes out)
246	Monica	 Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
247	Phoebe	 You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
248	Monica	 Ok, you have to stop playing now.
249	Phoebe	 Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
250	Monica	 Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
251	Phoebe	 (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
252	Monica	 (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question
253	Phoebe	 Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
254	Monica	 Alright, let me ask you this question
255	Phoebe	 Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
256	Monica	 Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
257	Phoebe	 Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
258	Monica	 Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question
259	Phoebe	 Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
260	Monica	 I'm sorry...
261	Phoebe	 I'm sorry too... (they hug)
262	Monica	 ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
263	Phoebe	 Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
264		(Monica seems to take it amiss)
265	Phoebe	 (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
266	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]
267	Rachel	 Hey!
268	Joey	 Hey!
269	Rachel	 Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
270	Joey	 (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
271	Rachel	 (looks puzzled) How...how...?
272	Joey	 I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
273	Rachel	 uh-huh
274	Joey	 And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
275	Rachel	 (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
276	Joey	 What?
277	Rachel	 What...how is it going with Drake?
278	Joey	 Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
279	Rachel	 What...that scene I saw was so good!
280	Joey	 Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
281	Rachel	 Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
282	Joey	 A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
283	Rachel	 So?
284	Joey	 So...I've never played that!
285	Rachel	 Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
286	Joey	 Uh...well...just once...with you...
287	Rachel	 Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
288	Joey	 (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
289	Rachel	 (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
290	Joey	 (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
291	Rachel	 (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
292	Joey	 Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
293		(Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)
294	Joey	 (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
295		Closing credits
296	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area]
297	Chandler	 I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
298	Monica	 (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
299		(Then Ross enters)
300	Ross	 (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
