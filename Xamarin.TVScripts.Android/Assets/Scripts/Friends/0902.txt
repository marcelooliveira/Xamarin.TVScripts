3	Ross	 You said you�d marry Joey?
4	Rachel	 Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I�m not helping.
5	Ross	 So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
6	Rachel	 That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
7	Ross	 So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
8	Rachel	 Well�Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
9	Ross	 Well, Chandler�s my oldest friend, but Joey�s my�No! Ah! (points at Rachel)
10	Rachel	 Ooooo!
11	Joey	 (Enters) Hey you guys I�m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.

13	Joey	 (He looks around the room) This isn�t the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)
14		Opening Credits
15	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s, Monica, Phoebe, Joey and Chandler are waiting for Ross and Rachel to come home and Monica is looking at the sign Phoebe bought that says, "It�s a Boy!"]
16	Monica	 Ok, I don�t wanna be negative so I�ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
17	Phoebe	 No they ran out of "It�s a girl" but I can fix this one, (She writes "not" in between it�s and a) See?
18	Monica	 (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.
19	Chandler	 Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
20	Monica	 Honey why don�t you go lie down.
21	Chandler	 No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
22	Joey	 Why�re you so tired?
23	Chandler	 Couldn�t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn�t sleep. Y�know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I�ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I�ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn�t fall asleep.
24	Joey	 You know what you should�ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
25	Rachel	 (enters with Emma) Hi!
26	Everyone	 Hi, welcome home!
27	Monica	 Phoebe did the signs!
28	Rachel	 Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
29	Phoebe	 Look at all the stuff people sent!
30	Rachel	 Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there�s something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think� (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.
31	Joey	 Hey so where�s Ross?
32	Rachel	 He�s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
33	Joey	 Is he still mad at us?
34	Rachel	 Well, you more then me, but he can�t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
35	Joey	 That�s not fair! I can�t do that.
36	Rachel	 Yeah, I�m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
37	Joey	 See this is what I was afraid of, I didn�t think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he�d be over it by now.
38	Chandler	 Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
39	[Scene	 A Boardroom, Chandler keeps drifting off to sleep at his meeting.]
40	Ms. McKenna	 The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
41		(Chandler drifts off and his arm slips off the table and he wakes back up.)
42	Ms. McKenna	 Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I�ll go straight to my forty two point plan.
43		(Chandler leans over to fall asleep on the man�s shoulder next to him, only the man catches his attempt.)
44	Chandler	 Walter (nods).
45	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s, Phoebe, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are watching Emma sleep.]
46	Phoebe	 She�s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
47	Monica	 Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
48	Ross	 (enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
49	Rachel	 Oh great, the pacifiers?
50	Ross	 In the closet.
51	Rachel	 The burping clogs?
52	Ross	 Linen closet.
53	Rachel	 The diapers?
54	Ross	 In the hospital.
55	Phoebe	 Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
56	Ross	 No I left the diapers at the hospital! There�s some in the bag but I�ll run out and get some more.
57	Rachel	 Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
58	Ross	 Sure what kind?
59	Rachel	 Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
60	Ross	 Please take your time, it�s an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
61	Rachel	 Blueberry.
62	Ross	 Blueberry it is.
63	Rachel	 Thanks.
64	Monica	 Wow, he�s really not letting this go, is he?
65	Rachel	 God how long do you think that�s gonna last?
66	Phoebe	 I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
67	Rachel	 Y�know I can�t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can�t believe how much I love her, I can�t get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
68	Phoebe	 You know that�s� that�s her.
69	Rachel	 Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I�m gonna wake her up.
70	Phoebe	 Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you�re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
71	Rachel	 Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come on little girl, hi!
72		(Emma starts crying)
73	Phoebe	 I can say I told you so but she�s kinda doing that for me.
74	Rachel	 Oh I�m sorry mummy�s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh. Shhh! Go back to sleep
75		(Emma continues crying in the background)
76	Monica	 Breaks your heart doesn�t it
77	Phoebe	 It really does� how long do you think we have to stay?
78	[Scene	 A Boardroom, Chandler�s meeting continues.]
79	Ms. McKenna	 Ok if everyone�s on board, it�s settled, Chandler, (Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he then wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?
80	Chandler	 Yep.
81	Ms. McKenna	 Are you on board?
82	Chandler	 (not knowing what he�s saying yes to) Yes.
83	Ms. McKenna	 Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa. You�re gonna love Oklahoma.
84		(Chandler smiles and nods then realizes what he�s agreed to.)
85	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s, Emma continues crying while Rachel, Monica and Phoebe try different methods to stop her crying.]
86	Phoebe	 Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
87	Monica	 Alright here�s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
88	Rachel	 Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)
89	Monica	 It worked!
90	Rachel	 Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won�t stop crying.
91	Monica	 Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
92	Rachel	 Yeah, I�m not so sure.
93	Monica	 Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
94	Phoebe	 Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
95	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is getting Rachel�s muffin.]
96	Ross	 Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
97	Gunther	 Diapers huh?
98	Ross	 Yep.
99	Gunther	 So I guess Rachel had you baby?
100	Ross	 Yep, can you believe it?
101	Gunther	 Nope! I still can�t believe she slept with you in the first place.
102	Ross	 Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a� Huh?
103	Joey	 (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it�s Joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you�re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
104	Ross	 Ah actually we don�t. (Ross walks off)
105	Joey	 Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn�t even do anything wrong.
106	Ross	 (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn�t do anything wrong?!
107	Joey	 I said I didn�t technically.
108	Ross	 Okay let�s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
109	Joey	 Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don�t really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?
110	Ross	 And I can even understand that you couldn�t tell Rachel, but why couldn�t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn�t.
111	Joey	 I know I should�ve. (Makes quote marks again.) "I�m sorry."
112	Ross	 Not using it right, Joe.
113		(He brings his hands in closer to his face then does it again.)
114	Ross	 I�m gonna go.
115	Joey	 No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can�t leave) Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
116	Ross	 Give me the bag.
117	Joey	 No, look, I don�t know what else to do. I said I�m sorry!
118	Ross	 Joey!
119	Joey	 You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
120	Ross	 I�m not gonna hit you.
121	Joey	 Why not? You�ll feel better! I�ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
122	Ross	 No I don�t.
123	Joey	 A little bit.
124	Ross	 No.
125	Joey	 Little bit.
126	Ross	 No!
127	Joey	 (excited) A little bit more.
128	Ross	 Give me the bag.
129	Joey	 No, hit me
130	Ross	 Give me the bag.
131	Joey	 Hit me.
132	Ross	 Joey, give me the bag.
133	Joey	 Hit me!
134	Ross	 Joe I�m not kidding�
135	Joey	 (interrupting) Hit me, hit me.
136	Ross	 No!
137	Joey	 (shouts) Hit me! Hit me!
138		(Ross throws a punch, but Joey ducks and Ross punches the pole. Ross then screams from the pain and turns to Gunther, and Gunther has a huge smile on his face.)
139	Ross	 You ducked!!
140	Joey	 I�m sorry! It was a reflex!
141	Ross	 Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
142	Joey	 I couldn�t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn�t and Joey punches Ross. Gunther is amused.)
143	Ross	 What is the matter with you?!?
144	Joey	 You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn�t you duck?
145	Ross	 Why don�t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
146	Joey	 Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we�re there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) "Oops."
147		Commercial Break
148	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s, Emma is still crying.]
149	Monica	 Try feeding her again.
150	Rachel	 I already fed her.
151	Monica	 I know, that�s why I said again!
152	Phoebe	 Alright you guys, we can�t turn on each other, Okay? That�s just what she wants.
153	Chandler	 (enters) Hey.
154	Monica	 Hey.
155	Chandler	 Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
156	Rachel	 Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I�m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
157	Phoebe	 Oh I�m kinda part of this.
158	Chandler	 Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
159	Phoebe	 I knew I should have married Chandler.
160		(Phoebe and Rachel go to the back room and Emma continues to cry in the background while Chandler and Monica talk.)
161	Monica	 Okay what�s up
162	Chandler	 Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
163	Monica	 Oh yeah (smiles).
164	Chandler	 Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
165	Monica	 What? Who says that?
166	Chandler	 People who�ve never ever been to Paris.
167	Monica	 What�s going on?
168	Chandler	 We�re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
169	Monica	 Excuse me?
170	Chandler	 Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
171	Monica	 (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!
172	Chandler	 The Sooner State, whatever that is.
173	Monica	 Chandler, I don�t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
174	Chandler	 Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
175	Monica	 Are you trying to tell me that we�re moving to Oklahoma, or that you�re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
176	Chandler	 No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica�s not impressed.) I�ll get out of it.
177	Monica	 Thank you.
178	Chandler	 (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
179	Monica	 Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
180	[Scene	 Ms. McKenna�s Office, Chandler enters.]
181	Chandler	 Umm ma�am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don�t think I can move to Tulsa.
182	Ms. McKenna	 What?
183	Chandler	 It�s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I�d move to Tulsa, I didn�t really know what I was saying.
184	Ms. McKenna	 You fell asleep?
185	Chandler	 But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain�t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here�s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won�t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy�Please don�t make me go there!
186	Ms. McKenna	 Chandler, I�
187	Chandler	 No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) That�s a picture of your daughter, isn�t it, well she�s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I�ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
188	[Scene	 The Hospital, Joey is sitting in the lobby as Ross enters.]
189	Joey	 Hey, so how is it?
190	Ross	 I broke my thumb.
191	Joey	 Your thumb? That�s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you�re punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
192	Ross	 You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can�t)
193	Joey	 You, you want me to help you with that?
194	Ross	 Why, does it look like I�m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)
195	Joey	 Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what�s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
196	Ross	 Just Ross!
197	Joey	 It�s pretty, Okay date of birth?
198	Ross	 You know my birthday.
199	Joey	 Sure, May...tember.
200	Ross	 October 18th.
201	Joey	 Occupation? Dinosaurs.
202	Ross	 Actually I�m a palian� Dinosaurs is fine� the drawing is not.
203	Joey	 Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
204	Ross	 Ah, Rachel I guess.
205	Joey	 Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
206	Ross	 Just ah� just put roommate.
207	Joey	 Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you�re gonna get together right?
208	Ross	 I don�t think that we are.
209	Joey	 But you two were supposed to be together.
210	Ross	 Well, I thought so too, but then she said she�d marry you.
211	Joey	 Come on, Ross, that didn�t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
212	Ross	 Yeah that�s what she said.
213	Joey	 So?
214	Ross	 So I don�t wanna be just anybody.
215	Joey	 Wow.
216	Ross	 You know what, it�s, it�s better this way anyway. I mean I don�t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It�s just much easier if we�re just friends who have a kid.
217	Joey	 Really?
218	Ross	 Yeah.
219	Joey	 And you�re Okay with that?
220	Ross	 Yes. I mean, it�s what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That�s why they call them plans. Hello? (Pause) I�m fine.
221	Joey	 Hey, for what it�s worth, with Rachel I don�t think you�ll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."
222	Ross	 Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
223	Joey	 (makes quote marks) "Thanks."
224		(Ross looks away, not bothering)
225	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s, Emma continues to cry.]
226	Rachel	 Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
227	Monica	 About a week and a half.
228	Phoebe	 Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I�m just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
229	Monica	 Rach, try holding her a different way.
230	Rachel	 You guys, I�m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
231	Phoebe	 Alright, I�ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
232	Rachel	 Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)
233	Phoebe	 Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
234	Rachel	 Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can�t even comfort my own baby! I�m the worst mother ever!
235	Monica	 You�re just new at this, it�ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn�t have been easy but you figured that out.
236	Rachel	 Yeah I don�t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
237	Monica	 Okay I�ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)
238	Rachel	 I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)
239	Phoebe	 I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
240	Monica	 (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)
241	Phoebe	 (entering) Have I gone deaf?
242	Monica	 It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
243	Phoebe	 You must be a fireball in bed.
244	Monica	 I can�t believe it! She�s asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
245	Phoebe	 I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I�m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
246	Rachel	 Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
247	Monica	 Yes I did, I�m Monica, Super Aunt
248	Rachel	 You are the official baby crier stopper!
249	Monica	 Yes I am!!
250	Rachel	 You�re never leaving the apartment!
251	Monica	 Say what?
252	Rachel	 That�s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
253	Monica	 (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
254	Phoebe	 Thankfully you don�t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let�s give it six to eight months (she leaves).
255	Rachel	 Okay so listen I�m gonna go lay down.
256	Monica	 What?
257	Rachel	 You know the book says that whenever she�s sleeping I should be sleeping so� (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
258	Chandler	 (entering, loudly) Hey!
259	Monica	 Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
260	Chandler	 Oh so there can�t be any yelling.
261	Monica	 No.
262	Chandler	 We�re moving to Tulsa
263	Monica	 (loudly) What!?
264	Chandler	 Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can�t, I can�t hear you. (He runs out)
265	[Scene	 Ross and Rachel�s, Ross enters.]
266	Ross	 Hey.
267	Rachel	 Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to you?
268	Ross	 Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
269	Rachel	 Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
270	Ross	 Okay.
271	Rachel	 You know what I really really want?
272	Ross	 What, Rach?
273	Rachel	 I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
274	Ross	 (smiles) Right.
275	Rachel	 I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
276	Ross	 Well, that�s what I�m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?
277	Rachel	 No its really okay� Monica!
278	Monica	 (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!

280	[Scene	 Central Perk, Joey and Ross are sitting at one of the high tables.]
281	Joey	 You know, ah, I�ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it�s not my fault. It�s a natural instinct.
282	Chandler	 (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?
283	Joey	 Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler, he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and just stares at Joey.)
