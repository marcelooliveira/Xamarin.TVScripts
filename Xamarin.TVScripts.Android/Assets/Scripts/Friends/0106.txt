2	[Scene	 A Theater, the gang is in the audience wating for a play of Joey's to start.]
3	Rachel	 (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
4	Chandler	 You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
5	Phoebe	 The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
6		(The lights dim.)
7	Ross	 Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
8		(The lights go up on the stage, Joey, as Freud, is talking to a female patient.)
9	Joey	 Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
10		All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
11		Opening Credits
12	[Scene	 The Theater, the play has ended and everyone is applauding. As soon as the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.]
13	Rachel	 God. I feel violated.
14	Monica	 Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
15	Chandler	 (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
16	Ross	 Is it? Feels like two.
17	Chandler	 No, ten o'clock.
18	Ross	 What?
19	Chandler	 (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
20	Ross	 Oh. Hel-lo!
21	Chandler	 She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
22	Monica	 Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
23	Chandler	 Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
24	Rachel	 Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
25	Chandler	 Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
26	Ross	 He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
27	Chandler	 Thank you, buddy.
28	Phoebe	 Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
29	Monica	 You could do that!
30	Chandler	 Y'think?
31	All	 Yeah!
32	Chandler	 Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
33	Ross	 C'mon! C'mon!
34	Chandler	 Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
35	Aurora	 ...Yes?
36	Chandler	 Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
37	Aurora	 Yes, you said that.
38	Chandler	 Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
39	Aurora	 Chandler?
40		(Joey enters from behind a curtain. The others all talk at once.)
41	All	 Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
42	Joey	 Whadja think?
43		(Pause)
44	All	 ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
45	Joey	 C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
46	All	 (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.
47	Chandler	 (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
48	Rachel	 What is it?
49	Joey	 The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
50	Phoebe	 Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
51	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.]
52	Chandler	 Hey, kids.
53	All	 Hey.
54	Phoebe	 (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
55	Chandler	 Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
56	Monica	 Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
57	Chandler	 It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
58		(A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by italics.)
59	Aurora	 ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
60	Chandler	 Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
61	Chandler	 We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
62	Aurora	 ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
63	Chandler	 Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
64	Aurora	 'We' would be me and Rick.
65	Joey	 Who's Rick?
66	Chandler	 Who's Rick?
67	Aurora	 My husband.
68	All	 Ooooohhh.
69	Chandler	 Oh, so you're divorced?
70	Aurora	 No.
71	Chandler	 Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
72	Aurora	 No, I'm still married.
73	Chandler	 So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
74	Aurora	 Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
75	Chandler	 Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
76	Aurora	 Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
77	All	 What?!
78	Chandler	 So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
79	Aurora	 I suppose mainly sexual.
80	Chandler	 ...Hm.
81	Monica	 Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
82	Chandler	 What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
83	Monica	 Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
84	Chandler	 Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff
85	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
86	Ross	 No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
87	Monica	 What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
88	Joey	 I couldn't do it.
89	Monica	 Good for you, Joey.
90	Joey	 When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
91	Ross	 Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
92		(They all pretend to fall asleep.)
93	Ross	 Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
94	Monica	 We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
95	All	 Yeah! C'mon!
96	Ross	 Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
97		(They all fall asleep again.)
98	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.]
99	Rachel	 Tah-daaah!
100	Chandler	 Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
101	Rachel	 Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
102	Ross	 Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
103	Rachel	 Well, whaddya think?
104	All	 Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
105	Monica	 ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
106	All	 Uh-oh...
107	Monica	 How-how did that happen?
108	Rachel	 I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
109	Monica	 Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
110	Phoebe	 (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
111	Chandler	 Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
112	Monica	 You guys, I am not that bad!
113	Phoebe	 Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
114	Monica	 That is so unfair!
115	Ross	 Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
116	Monica	 Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
117	Ross	 Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
118	Monica	 Why not?
119	Ross	 Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
120	Monica	 I could do that.
121	Rachel	 Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
122	Monica	 Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
123	Chandler	 Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
124	Monica	 STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
125	Ross	 Monica? You're Mom.
126		(Monica gasps.)
127	Phoebe	 Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
128		(Joey enters and he's on the phone.)
129	Joey	 (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
130	All	 Oh my God! Whoah!
131	Monica	 Well, what's the part?
132	Joey	 Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
133	Phoebe	 Seriously, what-what's the part?
134	Joey	 "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
135	Ross	 C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
136	Joey	 ...I'm his (mumbles)
137	Rachel	 ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
138	Joey	 ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
139	Monica	 (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
140	Joey	 C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
141	Chandler	 Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
142	Joey	 Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
143	Ross	 You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
144		Commercial Break
145	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Monica is getting the door.]
146	Monica	 Alright, alright, alright...
147		(Joey enters with Monica's paper and hands it to her.)
148	Joey	 Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
149	Monica	 For what?
150	Joey	 Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
151	Monica	 Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
152	Joey	 Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
153		(Chandler enters with the phone.)
154	Chandler	 Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
155	Monica	 He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
156	Chandler	 C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
157	Monica	 I warned you...
158		(Rachel enters from her room.)
159	Rachel	 Who is being loud?
160	Chandler	 Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
161	Monica	 Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
162	Chandler	 Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
163	Rachel	 Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
164	Chandler	 No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
165	Monica	 Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
166		(She opens the door and he leaves.)
167	[Scene	 A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.]
168	Director	 (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.) Okay, everybody ready?
169	Joey	 Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
170	Director	 Lose the robe.
171	Joey	 Me?
172	Director	 That would work.
173	Joey	 Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.
174	Director	 Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.
175		(Joey starts to the shower with a grim, determined look on his face.)
176	Director	 And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
177	Joey	 Well, I'm- I'm showering.
178	Director	 No, that was clenching.
179	Joey	 Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
180	Director	 I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
181	Joey	 I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
182	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.]
183	Chandler	 God, I love these fingers...
184	Aurora	 Thank you.
185	Chandler	 No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
186	Aurora	 (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She starts to get up.)
187	Chandler	 Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
188	Aurora	 Okay.
189	Chandler	 Don't go.
190	Aurora	 Okay. Oh no, I have to.
191	Chandler	 (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
192	Aurora	 (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
193	Chandler	 Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
194	Aurora	 It's not Rick.
195	Chandler	 What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
196	Aurora	 No, it's-it's Andrew.
197	Chandler	 I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
198	Aurora	 He's... new.
199	Chandler	 Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
200	Aurora	 No, that's not exactly what I was..
201	Chandler	 Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
202	Aurora	 So what do you want?
203	Chandler	 You.
204	Aurora	 You have me!
205	Chandler	 Nono, just you.
206	Aurora	 Whaddyou mean?
207	Chandler	 Lose the other guys.
208	Aurora	 ...Like, ...all of them?
209	Chandler	 C'mon, we're great together, why not?
210	Aurora	 Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
211	Chandler	 ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
212	Aurora	 So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
213	Chandler	 I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
214	Aurora	 Which one?
215	Chandler	 ...The second guy.
216	Aurora	 (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.
217		(She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)
218	Chandler	 Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
219		(She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)
220	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler. Joey is absent.]
221	Ross	 Look at it this way
222		(Joey enters.)
223	All	 Hey!
224	Monica	 Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
225	Joey	 Nope.
226	Ross	 No? What happened, big guy?
227	Chandler	 (to Ross) "Big guy?"
228	Ross	 It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
229	Joey	 I got fired.
230	All	 Oh!
231	Joey	 Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
232	Rachel	 Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
233	Joey	 My mom will.
234	Chandler	 Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
235	Joey	 Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
236	Monica	 Maybe this wasn't your shot.
237	Ross	 Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
238	Joey	 Hard to tell, I was naked.
239	Phoebe	 No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
240	Joey	 Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
241		(Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)
242	Monica	 I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
243	All	 Night.
244	Rachel	 Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
245	Monica	 (determined) Uh-huh!
246	Rachel	 Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
247	Monica	 Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)
248	Ross	 She is a kook.
249		Closing Credits
250	[Scene	 Monica's Bedroom, she's lying in bed wide awake.]
251	Monica	 (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)
