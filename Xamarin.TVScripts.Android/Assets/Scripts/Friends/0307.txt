2	[Scene	 Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is telling a story about what happened at work and the rest of the gang are thinking to themselves, denoted by italics.]
3	Ross	 So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....
4	Rachel	 I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.
5	Monica	 Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
6	Chandler	 If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
7	Gunther	 What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
8		(Joey is singing in his head.)
9	Phoebe	 Who’s singing?
10		Opening Credits
11	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there including Janice, they’re watching Happy Days.]
12	Ross	 Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
13	Monica	 I was always Joanne.
14	Joey	 Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?
15		(A commercial for the Mattress King, Janice’s ex-husband, comes on TV.)
16	Phoebe	 Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!
17	Joey	 Booo!!
18	Chandler	 (to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
19	Janice	 Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
20	Matress King	 (on TV) ‘Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I’m so depressed I’m going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I’m going medieval on prices!
21	Chandler	 What a wank!
22	Janice	 Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.
23	Monica	 I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m appalled for you by the way.
24	Matress King	 (on TV) I’m close. I’m cheap. I’m the king.
25	[Scene	 Central Perk, Rachel is on the phone, everyone else is there except Joey.]
26	Rachel	 ‘Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night. (listens) Okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)
27	Ross	 We?
28	Rachel	 Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s okay.
29	Ross	 Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
30	Rachel	 Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.
31	Ross	 Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.
32	Rachel	 But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
33	Chandler	 (leaning in) I’ll go.
34	Ross	 Fine.
35	Rachel	 Thank you.
36	Ross	 Hi Gunther.
37	Gunther	 Yeah, we’ll see!
38	Joey	 (entering) Hey, you guys!
39	Phoebe	 Hey!
40	Joey	 Guess what?
41	Ross	 What?
42	Joey	 I got a gig!
43	All	 Yay!!
44	Chandler	 See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.
45	Phoebe	 Yeah, I can’t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!
46	Monica	 What’s the part?
47	Joey	 Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
48	Ross	 Come on! That’s great.
49	All	 Wow!
50	Joey	 Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
51	Ross	 Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
52	Joey	 (glares at him) I know!
53	[Scene	 Mattress King, Monica and Phoebe are shopping for a new mattress.]
54	Phoebe	 Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.
55	Monica	 Not at these prices.
56	Phoebe	 (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!
57	Monica	 (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
58	Phoebe	 Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
59	[Scene	 Classroom. Joey is writing his name on the board, but turns around before he’s done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then underlines it, and draws the line right through his name.]
60	Joey	 Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
61	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Phoebe is already there waiting for the delievery guy.]
62	Joey	 Hi!
63	Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
64	Joey	 Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’
65	Phoebe	 Ooooh, nice.
66	Joey	 Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
67	Phoebe	 Oh, yay!
68	Joey	 Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.
69		(There is a knock on the door.)
70	Phoebe	 Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)
71	Guy	 Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to Phoebe) You Miss Geller?
72	Phoebe	 Okay.
73	Guy	 Sign here. (hands her a clipboard)
74	Phoebe	 Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s that bedroom there. (points to Monica’s room)
75	Joey	 Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
76	Phoebe	 Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.
77	Joey	 You want me to lie to Chandler?
78	Phoebe	 Is that a problem?
79	Joey	 No.
80	Phoebe	 Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)
81	Joey	 Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.
82	Phoebe	 Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.
83	Joey	 Ahh!
84		(Joey throws a punch and just lightly taps her on the shoulder, Phoebe counters with a jab to the nose.)
85	Joey	 Hey now!
86		(Phoebe throws another jab, and lands it on Joey’s nose, causing it to bleed.)
87	Joey	 Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.
88	Phoebe	 Oh! Oh! Oh!
89	Joey	 Okay, great.
90	Phoebe	 Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.
91	Joey	 Okay.
92	Phoebe	 ‘Kay, put your head back.
93	Joey	 All right. I can’t see.
94	Phoebe	 All right, I have ya. Oh God.
95	Guy	 Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
96	Phoebe	 Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
97	Guy	 Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)
98	[Scene	 Restaurant, Rachel and Ross and Dr. Green are having dinner.]
99	Rachel	 Hi Daddy!
100	Dr. Green	 This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
101	Rachel	 You remember Ross.
102	Dr. Green	 Um-hmm.
103	Ross	 Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
104	Dr. Green	 So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is successful.) (to Ross) How’s the library?
105	Ross	 Ugh, museum.
106	Dr. Green	 What happened to the library?
107	Ross	 There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
108	Dr. Green	 You know what’s really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
109	Ross	 Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.
110	Rachel	 Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
111	Dr. Green	 What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
112	Ross	 It’s not a library...
113	Dr. Green	 (interrupting him) I know!! It’s a museum! What, you’re the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don’t know to the waiter.)
114	[Scene	 After dinner.]
115	Ross	 So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.
116	Dr. Green	 They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
117	Ross	 It gives it a nice antiquey look.
118	Dr. Green	 (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
119	Ross	 Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)
120	Dr. Green	 Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
121	Rachel	 Okay.
122	Ross	 Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
123	Rachel	 Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.
124	Ross	 Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
125	Rachel	 Yeah. That’s Daddy.
126	Ross	 That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.
127	Rachel	 Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.
128	Ross	 So?
129	Rachel	 So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.
130	Ross	 You really serve people sneezers?
131	Rachel	 Well um, I don’t.
132	Dr Green	 You kids ready?
133	Ross	 Thanks again, Dr. Green.
134	Dr. Green	 All right.
135		(Ross takes a twenty and slips it underneath the bill when Dr. Green isn’t looking.)
136	Dr. Green	 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
137	Ross	 Oh, ah, you don’t need that.
138	Dr. Green	 Why not?
139	Ross	 The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
140	Dr. Green	 (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
141	Ross	 Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.
142	Rachel	 Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.
143	Ross	 I know.
144	Dr. Green	 Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?
145	Rachel	 Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.
146	Ross	 Nothing I do means anything, really.
147	Dr. Green	 This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)
148	Ross	 Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.
149	[Scene	 Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]
150	Joey	 Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
151	Student	 Hey, Mr. Trib.
152	Joey	 Hey-hey.
153	Student	 Guess what, I got an audition!
154	Joey	 Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.
155	Student	 I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
156	Joey	 You bet! What’s the part?
157	Student	 Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
158		(Joey does the ‘232 divided by 13 bad news’ look.)
159		Commercial Break
160	[Scene	 Hallway, Ross and Rachel are returning from dinner.]
161	Rachel	 You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.
162	Ross	 Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
163	Rachel	 Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
164	Ross	 Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
165		(they go into Monica and Rachel’s, and see Phoebe hopping around.)
166	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
167	Phoebe	 I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
168	Rachel	 Um. yeah.
169	Phoebe	 I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room)
170	Rachel	 All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
171	Ross	 Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.
172	Rachel	 Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.
173	Ross	 Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
174	Rachel	 Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
175	Ross	 Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.
176	Rachel	 Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)
177	Ross	 Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels.
178	[Scene	 Monica’s bedroom, Phoebe is trying to hide the bed from Monica.]
179	Monica	 (sees the bed) What’s this?
180	Phoebe	 Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
181	Monica	 This is not the bed I ordered!
182	Phoebe	 I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!
183		(Phoebe starts to make a sound like a car accelerating)
184	Monica	 Phoebe!
185		(Phoebe makes a sound like a car screeching to a halt.)
186	Monica	 Why is this car in my bedroom?
187	Phoebe	 I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...
188	Monica	 When did I sign for it?
189	Phoebe	 When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!
190	Monica	 Did you make brownies today?
191	Chandler	 Knock, knock.
192	Monica	 (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.
193	Chandler	 Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
194	Phoebe	 It’s Monica’s bed. What?
195	Chandler	 Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.
196	Phoebe	 So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
197	Chandler	 Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
198	Monica	 Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)
199	[Scene	 Classroom, Joey is coaching his student.]
200	Student	 Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.
201	Joey	 Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
202	Student	 No.
203	Joey	 Whoa. That was really good.
204	Student	 Thanks, any suggestions?
205		(Joey gets the evil look on his face.)
206	[Scene	 Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there, yelling at Joey.]
207	Chandler	 You told him to play the boxer gay!!
208	Joey	 Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.
209	Chandler	 You totally screwed him over.
210	Monica	 Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?
211	Joey	 Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.
212	Phoebe	 Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.
213	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is greeting her Father for their brunch.]
214	Rachel	 (opening the door) Hi Daddy.
215	Dr. Green	 Baby. Ross.
216	Ross	 Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.)
217	Dr. Green	 Thanks for dinner last night.
218	Ross	 Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
219	Dr. Green	 Nice hair. What’d ya do? Swim here?
220	Ross	 (to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.
221	Rachel	 What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
222	Ross	 Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)
223	Rachel	 What?!
224	Ross	 Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....
225	Dr. Green	 Ross? What’s with the neck?
226	Rachel	 He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
227	Dr. Green	 You’re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn’t get into medical school in Extapa!
228	Ross	 Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.
229	Rachel	 Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
230	Ross	 Uh.
231	Dr. Green	 Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
232	Rachel	 Well that’s his last name.
233	Ross	 And his first name.
234	Dr. Green	 He’s Bobby Bobby?
235	Rachel	 It’s Robert Bobby.
236	Dr. Green	 Oh.
237	Rachel	 And um, excuse me, he helps me.
238	Ross	 Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
239	Dr. Green	 What do you need help for?
240	Rachel	 With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.
241	Dr. Green	 Oh God!
242	Ross	 Argue with that.
243	Rachel	 What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
244	Dr. Green	 Come on! You’re just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!
245	Ross	 I know that!
246	Dr. Green	 So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
247	Rachel	 I’m sorry, let her?
248	Ross	 What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.
249	Dr. Green	 Wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!
250	Rachel	 No.
251	Dr. Green	 Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
252		(Both he and Ross start laughing)
253	Ross	 Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
254	Dr. Green	 I’d love some juice. Thanks.
255	Ross	 Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
256	Rachel	 Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.
257	Ross	 Excellent!
258	[Scene	 Classroom, Joey is talking to his students.]
259	Joey	 (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.
260	[Scene	 Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed.]
261	Jester	 Uh, may I help you?
262	Monica	 Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
263	Jester	 Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
264	Joey	 All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
265	Jester	 Nobody sees the king!
266	Joey	 Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)
267	Jester	 Hey! You can’t go back there!
268		(Joey goes to the door, but stops and looks through the window at Janice and the Mattress King, her ex-husband, kissing.)
269	Janice	 Oh my God.
270		(Joey fakes a scream.)
271		Closing Credits
272	[Scene	 Monica’s bedroom, Chandler is playing with the bed.]
273	Chandler	 Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.
