2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's, Monica is mixing some Thanksgiving treat (I’m assuming mashed potatoes) in a bowl.]
3	Monica	 (on phone) Okay, great! Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
4	Chandler	 Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
5		[Chandler throws his coat on the couch]
6	Monica	 (not amused by Chandler’s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.
7	Chandler	 Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
8		[Monica goes to fiddle with something on the table.]
9	Monica	 Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.
10		[Monica goes to the stove.]
11	Chandler	 (shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live together?
12	Monica	 Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)
13	Chandler	 Why haven’t you told them?!
14	Monica	 Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.
15	Chandler	 Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
16	Monica	 (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)
17	Chandler	 Why wouldn’t they be happy?
18	Monica	 Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.
19	Chandler	 What? What? Why?!
20	Monica	 Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
21	Chandler	 Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
22	Monica	 Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.
23	Chandler	 Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.
24	Monica	 You really think that’ll work?
25	Chandler	 Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?
26	Monica	 (hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!
27		Opening Credits
28	[Scene	 Joey and Janine’s, Joey and Ross are playing Sony Playstation. Chandler enters.]
29	Chandler	 Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?
30		[Chandler goes to stand to the side of the TV.]
31	Ross	 (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!
32	Chandler	 Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
33	Ross	 (not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you.
34	Chandler	 (annoyed) Do you know why?
35	Ross	 I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-
36	Chandler	 (angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
37		[Joey and Ross get annoyed with Chandler's outburst.]
38	Chandler	 This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
39	Joey	 Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?
40	Chandler	 Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
41	Joey	 Well maybe I love ya’.
42	Chandler	 [mocks that last comment].
43		[Chandler starts to leave as Janine enters]
44	Janine [to Chandler]	 Hey.
45	Chandler	 Hey.
46		[Chandler exits]
47	Janine	 Hey guys!
48		[Joey and Ross drop their video game controllers.]
49	Ross	 (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!
50	Janine	 Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?
51	Joey	 Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?
52	Janine	 Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
53	Ross	 For real?
54	Janine	 No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.
55	Joey	 Ye-ye, we go to yours!
56	Ross	 Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
57	Janine	 (not sure of what to make of that) Okay.
58		[Janine leaves]
59		[Ross looks at Joey coyly.]
60	Joey	 How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.
61	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s, Phoebe enters with a paper turkey.]
62	Phoebe	 Hey!
63	All	 Hey!
64	Rachel	 Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
65	Phoebe	 Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!
66		[Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel laugh]
67	Monica	 Nothing.
68	Rachel	 (worried) Nothing?
69	Monica	 No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
70	Rachel	 So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?
71	Monica	 You’re not gonna mess it up.
72	Rachel	 Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?
73	Monica	 Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.
74		[Joey and Ross enter.]
75	Joey and Ross	 Hey!
76	All	 Hey!
77	Joey	 Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
78	Ross	 And the place looks so nice!
79	Joey	 Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
80	Ross	 Happy Thanksgiving!
81	The Girls	 Happy Thanksgiving!
82	Joey	 Well, this has been great!
83	Ross	 See ya!
84		[Joey and Ross go to the door, ready to leave.]
85	Monica	 Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?
86	Ross	 Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
87	Monica	 Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
88	Ross	 Some would say she’s attractive, yes.
89	Phoebe	 And who else is going to be there?
90	Joey	 Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
91	Rachel	 Her dancer friends?
92	Joey	 (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!
93	Ross	 (to Joey) Dude, we were good!
94	Monica	 You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!
95	Phoebe	 Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
96	Ross	 Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
97	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
98		[Enter Jack and Judy Geller]
99	Mrs. Geller	 Hello everybody!
100	Mr. Geller	 Hi!
101	All	 Hi!
102		[Kisses and hugs are exchanged.]
103	Monica	 Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!
104	Mrs. Geller	 (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
105	Chandler	 Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
106		[Chandler goes to take off Jack’s coat. He then notices little white flakes on Jack’s shoulders. He begins to wipe them off.]
107	Chandler	 Whoa, snowing out there?
108	Mr. Geller	 (angry) No.
109		[Time lapse. The gang is sitting down for Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is at the head of the table, Mr and Mrs Geller are to his right. Joey and Ross are to his left. Monica is serving things. Phoebe is in the living room and Rachel is at the sink.]
110	Mr. Geller	 Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
111		[Chandler, trying to make nice with Jack, laughs at his joke and points at Jack.]
112	Mr. Geller	 Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point.
113		[Monica rushes over to Chandler’s side.]
114	Monica	 Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
115	Mr. Geller	 My joke wasn’t funny.
116		[Phoebe walks from the living room to the kitchen and talks quietly to Rachel.]
117	Phoebe	 Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
118	Rachel	 Really?!
119	Phoebe	 Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk."
120		[We see a shot of Jack stuffing his face with food. Some dream hunk!]
121	Rachel	 I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”
122		[Time lapse. Ross and Joey are cleaning the table while Judy and Phoebe talk by the window. Jack and Chandler are sitting on the couch while Monica sits on the coffee table.]
123	Monica	 Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!
124	Chandler	 Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
125	Mr. Geller	 I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
126		[Chandler and Monica exchange worried looks.]
127	Chandler	 (worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
128		[Rachel is in the kitchen fiddling with her English truffle. Joey and Ross, anxious to leave and go to Janine’s party, are egging her on to hurry up.]
129	Joey	 Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
130	Rachel	 (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?
131	Ross	 Yeah, yeah, what is it?
132	Rachel	 It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
133		[Joey and Ross make confused faces.]
134	Ross	 W-What was the one right before bananas?
135	Rachel	 The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
136	Joey	 Y-sure!
137	Rachel	 (teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.
138	Joey and Ross	 (faking dissapointment) Okay.
139		[Rachel leaves]
140	Ross	 Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
141		[Ross goes to look in the magazine Rachel got her recipe from.]
142	Joey	 I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
143		[Ross looks up as if saying that Joey was weird. He begins flipping through the pages, only to find that they are sticky. So one page is overlapping another, making two recipes look like one.]
144	Ross	 Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
145	Joey	 (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!
146	Ross	 Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!
147	Joey	 (sad) Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
148	Ross	 No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.
149	Joey	 Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
150	Ross	 Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
151	Joey	 (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...
152		[Rachel enters]
153	Rachel	 Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
154	Joey	 Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
155	Rachel	 No!
156	Joey	 (frustrated) Still not hot enough!
157		[Joey leaves]
158		[Phoebe walks over to talk to Rachel.]
159	Phoebe	 Rachel?
160	Rachel	 Yeah?
161	Phoebe	 Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.
162		[We see a shot of Jack drinking condensed milk on the couch.]
163		[Ross and Judy enter the living room. Judy and Ross sit down on the couch beside Jack. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the coffee table.]
164	Monica	 Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
165	Mrs. Geller	 Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
166	Chandler	 Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
167	Mr. Geller	 What’s the matter with him?
168	Mrs. Geller	 (whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think he’s stoned again.
169	Chandler	 (shocked) What?
170	Monica	 (shocked) What?
171	Ross	 (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
172		[Ross and Chandler get up and go into Rachel’s old room.]
173	[Scene	 Rachel’s old room. It’s pretty much empty except for a few boxes against the walls. Ross and Chandler enter.]
174	Ross	 Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.
175	Chandler	 You do? Why?
176	Ross	 Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
177	Chandler	 What?! Why did you do that?
178	Ross	 I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.
179	Chandler	 How could it not matter?!
180	Ross	 How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
181	Chandler	 What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
182	Ross	 I don’t know, I-I was all high.
183		Commercial Break
184	[Scene	 Rachel’s Old Bedroom, Continued from earlier. Monica enters the room.]
185	Monica	 Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!
186	Chandler	 Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
187	Monica	 Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!
188	Chandler	 The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
189	Ross	 Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
190	Monica	 You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!
191	Ross	 Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
192	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s, Time lapse. Jack is still on the couch, picking his teeth with his feet on the table. Phoebe and Judy are sitting on the table looking at him. Ross and Chandler are sitting by the window talking. Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen fooling with Rachel’s trifle. Monica walks into the living room from the kitchen.]
193	Monica	 Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-
194	Phoebe	 Monica, leave him alone!
195		[Monica gives Phoebe a surprised expression and goes over to Ross and Chandler.]
196	Joey	 (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?
197	Rachel	 (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.
198	Joey	 Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?
199	Rachel	 Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
200		[Joey gives her an understanding look.]
201	Rachel	 So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
202	Joey	 Oh I am!
203		[Chandler and Monica are by the window pressuring Ross to tell his parents the truth.]
204	Monica	 Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!
205	Ross	 Okay, fine!
206		[Ross gets up to go tell his parents.]
207		[Joey rushes over.]
208	Joey	 Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
209	Ross	 Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
210		[Monica and Chandler make “What was that?” gestures. Joey and Ross go into Rachel’s old room.]
211	[Scene	 Rachel’s old room, Ross and Joey enter.]
212	Joey	 Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
213	Ross	 What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
214	Joey	 Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?
215	Ross	 Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)
216	Joey	 (scolding) Dude, they’re not objects.
217		[Ross makes a sorry face.]
218	Joey	 Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.
219		[Joey and Ross go back out into the main area.]
220	Ross	 Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
221	Rachel	 Okay...
222		[The hallway. Rachel and Ross go out and they just stand there for a few seconds.]
223	Rachel	 What’s up, Ross?
224	Ross	 So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
225	Rachel	 Yeah!
226	Ross	 And um...You look nice today.
227	Rachel	 Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.
228	Ross	 What?
229	Rachel	 I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.
230	Ross	 (shocked) Eh?
231	Rachel	 I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
232	Ross	 (cutting her off) You’re alone.
233	Rachel	 No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.
234	Ross	 (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!
235		[Inside Monica and Chandler’s. Joey is almost done explaining the situation to everyone.]
236	Joey	 Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that he’s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?
237	Chandler	 Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
238		[Ross and Rachel re-enter.]
239	Joey	 Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!
240	Rachel	 Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
241	Joey	 (happily) Really?
242	Rachel	 No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!
243	Phoebe	 So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?
244	Rachel	 It sure is.
245	Phoebe	 Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
246	Rachel	 Beef.
247	Phoebe	 I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.
248		[Phoebe gets up and goes into Rachel’s old room, a smile on her face.]
249	Rachel	 Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
250	Monica	 Really?
251		[Rachel hands Monica a plate. Monica takes a spoonful of the whipped cream portion.]
252	Rachel	 Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
253	Monica	 Okay.
254		[Monica takes a bigger spoonful and a pea falls off]
255	Rachel	 Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
256		[Monica puts the pea on top of the spoonful and takes a bite.]
257	Rachel	 Well?
258	Monica	 (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It’s good!
259	Rachel	 Really? How good?
260	Monica	 It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
261		[Ross glares at Monica.]
262		[Everyone takes a bite of their trifle.]
263	All	 (faking enjoyment) Mmm.
264	Chandler	 (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
265		[Chandler exits to the balcony.]
266	Mrs. Geller	 (lying) I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.
267	Mr. Geller	 (also lying) I’ll help you dial.
268		[Jack and Judy exit to Monica’s room.]
269	Monica	 (again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
270		[Monica exits to the bathroom.]
271	Rachel	 Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
272		[Rachel reaches for Ross’s plate]
273	Ross	 Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
274		[Rachel leaves to the balcony.]
275	Ross	 It tastes like feet!
276	Joey	 I like it.
277	Ross	 Are you kidding?
278	Joey	 What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
279		[Rachel and Chandler re-emerge from the balcony.]
280	Rachel	 ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
281		[Chandler makes a fake "I know I couldn’t believe it either" gesture.]
282	Chandler	 (lying) Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
283		[Phoebe comes back from Rachel’s old room.]
284	Phoebe	 Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
285	Rachel	 Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
286	Phoebe	 I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
287	Rachel	 (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
288	Phoebe	 Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
289		[Jack and Judy come out of Monica’s room and sit down on the couch.]
290	Mr. Geller	 Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.
291	Phoebe	 Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
292		[Rachel and Phoebe walk into the kitchen. Monica comes out of the bathroom and goes over to Ross.]
293	Monica	 Ross? Let’s go.
294	Ross	 Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
295	Monica	 Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.
296	Ross	 Wha-what?
297	Monica	 (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
298	Mr. and Mrs. Geller	 What?!
299	Ross	 (in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
300	Mr. and Mrs. Geller	 Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)
301	Ross	 Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
302	Mrs. Geller	 It was you?
303	Monica	 And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!
304		[The Gellers stare at Ross. Ross looks at his parents with an afraid, shocked look.]
305	Ross	 Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!
306		[The Gellers glare at Monica.]
307		[Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the table, looking at the Geller siblings like they’re weirdos.]
308	Monica	 Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!
309		[The Gellers glare at Ross.]
310	Ross	 Monica and Chandler are living together!
311		[The Gellers glare at Monica, shocked]
312		[Monica and Chandler both are shocked. Ross gives Monica a “take that!” look.]
313	Monica	 Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
314		[The Gellers glare at Ross.]
315	Phoebe	 (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!
316	Rachel	 (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!

318	Mrs. Geller	 (rubbing her temples) That’s alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’t supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.)
