6	Monica	 Just...please tell him.
7	Rachel	 Shut up!
8	Chandler	 Tell me what?
9	Monica	 Look at you, you won't even look at him.
10	Chandler	 (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
11	Rachel	 All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
12	Phoebe	 Doing it on this table. (points at the table)
13	Chandler	 Wow!
14	Joey	 Exellent dream score.
15	Ross	 Why, why, why would you dream that?
16	Chandler	 More importantly, was I any good?
17	Rachel	 Well, you were pretty damn good.
18	Chandler	 Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
19	Rachel	 Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
20	Ross	 I love it, when we share.
21		(Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.)
22	Chandler	 You're okay there?
23	Ross	 I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.

25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Central Perk, continued from earlier, Chandler is sitting on the table.]
27	Chandler	 Hello Rachel.
28	Rachel	 Get off.
29	Phoebe	 (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
30	Joey	 I don't know. What are you wearing?
31		(Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him)
32	Ross	 Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
33	Phoebe	 Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
34	Chandler	 Pirates again?
35	Phoebe	 No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
36	Joey	 Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
37	Chandler	 (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
38	Phoebe	 What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
39	Chandler	 Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
40	Phoebe	 I could be a secretary.
41	Chandler	 Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
42	Phoebe	 I could do that.
43		(Ross's beeper goes off)
44	Rachel	 What are you playing with?
45	Ross	 Oh, it's my new beeper.
46	Joey	 What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
47	Monica	 Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
48	Ross	 No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
49	Chandler	 A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
50	Monica	 All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
51	Rachel	 Off to see young Ethan?
52	Monica	 Thank you.
53	Joey	 How young is young Ethan? Young?
54	Monica	 He's... our age.
55	Chandler	 When we were?
56	Monica	 Okay, he's a senior in college.
57	Ross	 College?
58	Chandler	 Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
59	Monica	 No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
60	All	 What?
61	Monica	 Oh, I can't pass for 22?
62	Phoebe	 Well, maybe 25-26.
63	Monica	 I am 26.
64	Phoebe	 There you go.
65	[Scene	 Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are there when the phone starts ringing.]
66	Chandler	 Can you hear that?
67	Phoebe	 (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
68	Chandler	 See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
69	Phoebe	 Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)
70	Phoebe	 (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
71	Chandler	 I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
72	Phoebe	 Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
73	Chandler	 What?
74	Phoebe	 Ross says hi.
75	Chandler	 Ah!
76	Phoebe	 This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
77	Chandler	 Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
78	Phoebe	 Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
79	Chandler	 Okay.
80	Phoebe	 All right. Bye bye.
81	Chandler	 Bye bye.
82		(The intercom buzzes)
83	Chandler	 (answering it) Yes?
84	Phoebe	 Whatcha doin'?
85	Chandler	 Ooh. (leans against the desk)
86	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there. Monica is just finishing cleaning the windows.]
87	Monica	 Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
88	Rachel	 Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
89	Monica	 What?
90	Rachel	 Could tonight be the Night?
91	Monica	 I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
92	Rachel	 So, did you shave your legs?
93	Monica	 Yeah.
94	Rachel	 A-ha!
95	[Scene	 Central Perk. Joey and Ross are there.]
96	Joey	 Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
97		(Ross's beeper goes off)
98	Ross	 Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
99	Joey	 All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
100		(Ross dials a number on his cellular phone)
101	Ross	 (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, Andr� is not here. (to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
102	Joey	 Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.
103	Ross	 (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.
104		(Phoebe and Chandler enter)
105	Joey	 Hey, hey. How was the first day?
106	Phoebe	 Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
107	Chandler	 See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
108	Phoebe	 No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
109	Chandler	 Why not?
110	Phoebe	 Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
111	Chandler	 What?!
112	Phoebe	 I thought you knew that.
113	Chandler	 Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
114	Phoebe	 Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
115	Chandler	 What are you talking about?
116	Phoebe	 Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
117		(Joey and Ross laughs)
118	Chandler	 I can't belive it.
119	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
120	Chandler	 They do me?
121	Phoebe	 You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
122		(Joey and Ross laughs)
123	Chandler	 I don't sound like that.
124	Ross	 Oh, oh Chandler...
125	Joey	 Oh... Yeah, you do.
126	Ross	 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
127		(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs)
128	Joey	 (reaches for hi scones) My scones.
129	Phoebe, Joey, and Ross	 'My scones.'
130		(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs again)
131	Chandler	 Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
132		(Joey and Chandler laughs)
133	Chandler	 That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
134		(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laugh)
135	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Young Ethan are sitting in the couch.]
136	Monica	 Did not.
137	Young Ethan	 I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
138	Monica	 How was that possible?
139	Young Ethan	 Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking
140	Monica	 Okay.
141		(They kiss)
142	Young Ethan	 Okay.
143	Monica	 Unless...
144	Young Ethan	 What?
145	Monica	 Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
146	Young Ethan	 Yeah, I'd really like that.
147		(They kiss)
148	Young Ethan	 Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
149	Monica	 Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
150	Young Ethan	 Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
151	Monica	 Ethan?
152	Young Ethan	 Yeah?
153	Monica	 Are you a virgin?
154	Young Ethan	 Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
155	Monica	 Really?
156	Young Ethan	 Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
157		(They kiss)
158		[Time lapse. They are now in Monica's bedroom, on the bed.]
159	Young Ethan	 Wow!
160	Monica	 You keep saying that.
161	Young Ethan	 You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
162		(They kiss)
163	Monica	 Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
164	Young Ethan	 Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
165	Monica	 No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
166	Young Ethan	 Oh.
167	Monica	 Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
168	Young Ethan	 Huh!
169	Monica	 But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
170		(They kiss)
171	Young Ethan	 Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
172	Monica	 You're not a senior?
173	Young Ethan	 Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
174	Monica	 Ok...ay.
175		Commercial Break
176	[Scene	 Monica's Bedroom, continued from earlier.]
177	Monica	 What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
178	Young Ethan	 I just had sex.
179	Monica	 Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
180	Young Ethan	 Well, you never told me how old you were.
181	Monica	 Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
182	Young Ethan	 I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
183	Monica	 Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
184	Young Ethan	 ...in love with you.
185	Monica	 Really?
186	Young Ethan	 (nods) Sorry.
187	Monica	 Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
188	Young Ethan	 Who?
189	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, everyone exept Monica is there.]
190	Ross	 (on phone) Okay, Andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.
191	Chandler	 Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
192	Rachel	 No, forget it.
193	Chandler	 Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
194	Rachel	 All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.
195	Joey	 All right. (Moves closer.)
196	Ross	 Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
197	Rachel	 No.
198	Ross	 You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
199	Rachel	 No, it was just the three of us.
200	Ross	 Huh!
201	Joey	 So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
202	Rachel	 (laughs) You know what?
203	Joey	 What?
204	Rachel	 There were times when it wasn't even me.
205		(Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other then recoil in horror.)
206	Phoebe	 That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)
207		(Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesn't hear what the others say)
208	Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe	 Hey, Mon.
209	Rachel	 Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
210	All	 (shouting) Mon!
211		(Monica takes of her walkman)
212	Monica	 What?
213	Rachel	 Ethan called again.
214	Monica	 Oh.
215	Ross	 Are you not seeing him anymore?
216	Monica	 No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
217	Chandler	 And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
218		(Monica stares at Rachel)
219	Rachel	 I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
220	Joey	 Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
221		(Ross and Chandler laughs)
222	Ross	 Oh, yeah.
223	Monica	 Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
224	Joey, Chander, and Ross	 Sorry.
225	Ross	 It's morphin time!
226	Joey	 Stegosaurus!
227	Chandler	 Tyrannosaurus!
228		(They all cross they're arms like the Power Rangers do)
229	Phoebe	 Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!
230	Rachel	 Where are you going?
231	Phoebe	 Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
232	Chandler	 Work people? Nobody told me.
233	Phoebe	 No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
234	Chandler	 You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
235	Phoebe	 Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
236	Chandler	 You think I should?
237	Phoebe	 I really do, yeah.
238	Chandler	 Okay.
239	Phoebe	 Okay.
240	Chandler	 Okay.
241	Phoebe	 Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
242	[Scene	 Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]
243	Chandler	 I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
244	Phoebe	 You were great. But they still made fun of you.
245	Chandler	 What?
246	Phoebe	 You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
247	Chandler	 Then, I don't get it.
248	Phoebe	 Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
249	Chandler	 They do?
250	Phoebe	 Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
251	Chandler	 I just wan't to...
252	Phoebe	 No, but you can't.
253	Chandler	 But I just wa...
254	Phoebe	 Uh uh.

256	Monica	 Aren't you gonna...
257	Ross	 Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
258	Joey	 What about Andr�?
259	Ross	 Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
260		(Ethan enters)
261	Young Ethan	 Hey.
262	Monica	 That was gonna be my opener.
263	Rachel	 (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
264	Ross	 I thought that was just a rumour.
265	Rachel	 True story.
266	Joey	 They're here already?
267		(Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom)
268	Young Ethan	 All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
269	Monica	 It was.
270	Young Ethan	 Then, what's the problem?
271	Monica	 Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
272	Young Ethan	 Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
273	Monica	 This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
274	Young Ethan	 No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)
275	Monica	 ...love you.
276		(Ross, Rachel and Joey come back from the bathroom. They discover that Monica and Ethan aren't finished talking to each other yet.)

286	Santos	 Sure.
287	Gerston	 No problem.
288		(They go away, trying very hard not to laugh at Chandler)
289	Chandler	 You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
290	Phoebe	 Petrie.
291	Chandler	 Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
