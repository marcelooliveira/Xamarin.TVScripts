2	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is at the sink and Chandler is looking at a ring brochure.]
3	Chandler	 Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!
4	Phoebe	 Now, have you told anyone else?
5	Chandler	 No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.
6	Phoebe	 You told me.
7	Chandler	 Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
8	Phoebe	 Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
9	Chandler	 Me too.
10		(Joey and Ross enter causing Chandler to quickly hide the brochure behind his back.)
11	Joey	 Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
12	Chandler	 Hey.
13	Phoebe	 Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
14	Chandler	 Oh all right.
15	Phoebe	 Yeah, coffeehouse.
16	Ross	 Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
17	Chandler	 Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.
18		(Joey returns with a piece of pizza as Chandler and Phoebe exit.)
19	Ross	 How rude.
20	Joey	 Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)
21		Opening Credits
22	[Scene	 Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
23	Phoebe	 So how are things going with Paul?
24	Rachel	 Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
25	Phoebe	 That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.
26	Rachel	 So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
27	Phoebe	 No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
28	Paul	 (entering) Hi honey.
29	Rachel	 Hi!
30	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Watch this.
31	Paul	 (To Rachel) How are you?
32	Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Okay.
33	Phoebe	 Hi Paul!
34	Paul	 Hi Phoebe.
35	Phoebe	 So how are things going with you?
36	Paul	 Can’t complain.
37		(Phoebe turns to Rachel and mimes remove a lid of a jar. Ross enters and Paul motions for Rachel to leave with him now.)
38	Paul	 (whispering) Come on.
39	Rachel	 Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
40	Paul	 (To Ross) Hey!
41	Ross	 Hi!
42		(They shake hands and their lines overlap.)
43	Paul	 Ross!
44	Ross	 Great to see you!
45	Paul	 Good to see you too!
46	Ross	 How you doing?
47	Paul	 Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)
48	Ross	 Okay! You take care!
49		(Ross turns his back on Paul and makes a ‘I hate that guy’ face. Paul does the same thing.)
50	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
51	Phoebe	 Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
52	Ross	 Phoebe, why’d you do it?
53	Phoebe	 I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!
54	Ross	 What?! Why?!
55	Phoebe	 Please, I think you know why.
56	Ross	 I can’t think of anything.
57	Phoebe	 Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
58	Ross	 Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
59	Phoebe	 Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?
60	Ross	 I guess it could.
61	Phoebe	 Well then I think that’s it.
62	Ross	 Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
63	Phoebe	 Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
64	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Paul and Rachel are getting ready to go out. Paul is entering from the bathroom.]
65	Paul	 Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
66	Rachel	 Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
67	Paul	 It was fine.
68	Rachel	 Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
69	Paul	 I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
70	Rachel	 Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
71	Paul	 Are you talking about having sex?
72	Rachel	 No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
73	Paul	 Normal.
74	Rachel	 Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
75	Paul	 Nope! That never happened to me!
76	Rachel	 Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?
77	Paul	 Nope.
78	Rachel	 All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
79	Paul	 Okay.
80	Rachel	 Okay.
81	Paul	 Okay.
82	Rachel	 All right.
83	Paul	 When I was six years old.
84	Rachel	 Hm-mmm.
85	Paul	 I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
86	Rachel	 That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to leave, but Paul doesn’t move.)
87	Paul	 It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
88	Rachel	 Oh!
89		[Time Lapse, Paul is now weeping uncontrollably in Rachel’s arms.]
90	Paul	 And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here (points to it) you can see it.
91	Rachel	 Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
92	Paul	 Oh, I couldn’t eat now.
93	Rachel	 What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
94	Paul	 Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!
95	Rachel	 My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!
96		(Paul screams like a chicken and breaks down into tears again.)
97	[Scene	 A Jewelry Shop, Chandler and Phoebe are looking at engagement rings.]
98	Chandler	 Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
99	Phoebe	 Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
100	Chandler	 Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.
101	Phoebe	 Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
102	Chandler	 Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
103	Phoebe	 (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
104	Male Jeweler	 Can I help you?
105	Chandler	 Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
106	Phoebe	 Or not, whatever.
107	Male Jeweler	 This ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
108	Chandler	 Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
109	Male Jeweler	 Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?
110	Chandler	 (choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?
111	Phoebe	 Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
112	Male Jeweler	 8,600.
113	Phoebe	 We will give you $10.
114	Male Jeweler	 (angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!
115	Chandler	 Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
116	Male Jeweler	 Okay, I can let it go at eight.
117	Phoebe	 We stand firm at $10.
118	Male Jeweler	 (ignoring her) How would you like to pay?
119	Chandler	 Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.
120	Phoebe	 Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
121	Male Jeweler	 Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills. (Holds them up from his pocket.)
122	Phoebe	 I’ll give you $1 for them.
123	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross and Joey are there.]
124	Ross	 Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
125	Joey	 No.
126	Ross	 Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
127	Joey	 Yeah.
128	Ross	 Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
129	Joey	 Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
130	Ross	 Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
131	Joey	 Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
132	Gunther	 (handing them the bill) Here you go.
133	Ross	 Oh. (Starts to get his money)
134	Joey	 Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther Chandler’s card.) Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.
135	Ross	 All the time?
136	Joey	 All the time!
137	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is there as Rachel enters.]
138	Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God!!
139	Monica	 Still crying?
140	Rachel	 Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
141	Monica	 Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
142	Rachel	 What’s the other one?
143	Monica	 I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.
144	Rachel	 Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
145	Monica	 Oh, we have some…
146	Rachel	 No you don’t!
147	[Scene	 The Jewelry Store, Phoebe is busy trying on virtually everything in the store. She’s got earrings, rings, bracelets, and enough necklaces to put Mr. T to shame on.]
148	Phoebe	 Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too much?
149	Male Jeweler	 A tad.
150	Phoebe	 Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
151	Male Jeweler	 (to the female jeweler) Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring.
152	Female Jeweler	 I just sold it to that gentleman. (Points to the one walking out the store.)
153	Phoebe	 Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
154		Commercial Break
155	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Paul is still crying as Chandler enters.]
156	Paul	 Rachel?
157	Chandler	 No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
158	Paul	 (acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
159	Chandler	 No, did he hug you?!
160	Paul	 No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
161	Chandler	 Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
162	Paul	 Hey Chandler?
163	Chandler	 Yeah?
164	Paul	 Would you…….Would you hug me?
165	Chandler	 I’m a little busy here Paul.
166	Paul	 That’s exactly what my dad used to say! (Starts to breakdown again.)
167	Chandler	 Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
168	Paul	 Five more seconds.
169	Chandler	 Okay! (Pushes him away.)
170	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
171	Paul	 Joey! (Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)
172	Joey	 Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, "What’s going on?") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)
173	Chandler	 Do you have my credit card?
174	Joey	 Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket. (Paul hasn’t dropped him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!
175	Chandler	 Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
176	Joey	 Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
177	Chandler	 Oh, I can’t go.
178	Joey	 Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…
179	[Scene	 The Jewelry Store, Chandler is entering with his credit card and Phoebe is holding out another ring for him.]
180	Phoebe	 Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
181	Chandler	 Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
182	Phoebe	 Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!
183	Chandler	 What?
184	Phoebe	 Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!
185	Chandler	 They put you in jail?
186	Phoebe	 The little jail between the doors!
187	Chandler	 Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
188	Phoebe	 I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
189	Chandler	 Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
190	Phoebe	 Maybe it was the guy.
191	Chandler	 It was the ring!
192	[Scene	 Central Perk, Ross is on the couch and Joey is entering.]
193	Ross	 Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
194	Joey	 No! He blew us off!
195	Ross	 What?!
196	Joey	 I know!
197	Ross	 I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
198	Joey	 Can I tell you something? Me too.
199	Ross	 Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!
200	Joey	 Ooooh! Freeze him out.
201	Ross	 That’s right!
202	Joey	 I like it!
203	Ross	 Eh? We’ll show him!
204	Joey	 From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake hands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
205	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Paul is writing something as Rachel enters.]
206	Rachel	 Hi. I’m back.
207	Paul	 Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down!
208	Rachel	 Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice) That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
209	Paul	 Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! (Flips a couple pages and points to something.) Y’know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
210	Rachel	 A lover?
211	Paul	 A surfer.
212	Rachel	 Oh yeah surfer?
213	Paul	 I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?
214	Rachel	 Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?
215	Paul	 (barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude. (Pause) So full of dreams…
216	Rachel	 I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
217	Paul	 What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
218	Rachel	 Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.
219	Paul	 Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. It’s just that, when those gates open, you… (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close ‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
220	Rachel	 I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
221	Paul	 I would really like that. (They kiss.)
222	[Scene	 Rachel’s Bedroom, Paul and Rachel are recovering.]
223	Paul	 That was…so good. (Starts crying again.)
224	[Scene	 Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the ring he bought and not liking it.]
225	Phoebe	 (entering from her room) Hey.
226	Chandler	 I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
227	Phoebe	 It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!
228	Chandler	 No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
229	Phoebe	 Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
230	Chandler	 I can’t do that.
231	Phoebe	 Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.
232	[Scene	 A Restaurant, Chandler and Phoebe are entering. This is the place where the guy who bought Chandler’s ring is going to propose.]
233	Phoebe	 There he is! (Points.)
234	Chandler	 Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
235	Phoebe	 Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.
236	Chandler	 Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
237	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
238	Customer	 Who is it?
239	Phoebe	 It is your office.
240	Customer	 Do you know who at my office?
241	Phoebe	 John?
242	Customer	 Oh John! Great!
243		(She brings him over to Chandler.)
244	Phoebe	 (To Chandler) Here he is.
245	Chandler	 (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
246	Phoebe	 Wow! I would trade.
247	Customer	 It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
248	Chandler	 No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
249	Phoebe	 Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?
250	Customer	 You’re dying?!
251		(Phoebe coughs.)
252	Chandler	 Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.
253	Phoebe	 Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…
254	Chandler	 (interrupting her) Okay, that’s enough honey!
255	Customer	 I don’t know. (Pause) Let me see the ring.
256	Chandler	 Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
257	Customer	 (looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)
258	Chandler	 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!
259	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are watching TV as Chandler enters.]
260	Chandler	 Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
261	Joey	 (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.
262	Ross	 Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
263	Chandler	 Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
264	Joey	 Oh my God!!
265	Ross	 So you two are really serious?!
266	Chandler	 Yep, pretty much.
267	Ross	 You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! (They hug.)
268	Joey	 And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!
269	Chandler	 (goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?
270	Joey	 Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!
271	Chandler	 Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.
272	Joey	 I think I’m gonna cry!
273	Rachel	 (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I’ll dump you too!
274		(Ross and Joey urge Chandler to tell Rachel.)
275	Chandler	 I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
276	Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so happy!
277	Chandler	 I know.
278	Joey	 (holding an empty tissue box) Where’s all the tissues?! (Throws the box down in disgust.)
279		Ending Credits
280	[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's, continued from earlier. Chandler is showing Rachel the ring.]
281	Chandler	 Check out the ring.
282	Rachel	 (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
283	Phoebe	 (entering) Hi.
284	Ross	 Hey-hey Pheebs!
285	Phoebe	 What?
286	Ross	 Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
287	Phoebe	 Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
288		(Chandler laughs, turns, and sees that Ross and Joey aren’t happy.)
289	Ross	 You told her before you told us?
290	Chandler	 Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
