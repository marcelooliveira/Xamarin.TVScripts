2	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is getting ready for a fishing trip and Phoebe is asking him about the fishing lures. Ross is playing with the rod, and Monica is pretty much just watching the on goings.]
3	Phoebe	 (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?
4	Joey	 Guggly worm.
5	Phoebe	 (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?
6	Joey	 Glow-pop giggly jammer.
7	Phoebe	 (laughs harder) You make it so funny.
8	Monica	 (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s this?
9	Joey	 (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)
10	Ross	 (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.
11	Joey	 (going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
12	All	 Great!
13		(Chandler enters from his bedroom, all depressed and wearing sweat pants, with the chick and duck in tow.)
14	Chandler	 You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
15	Monica	 Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
16	Joey	 Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
17	Monica	 What’s Phase Two?
18	Joey	 Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.
19	Rachel	 How does going to a strip club help him better?
20	Ross	 Because there are naked ladies there.
21	Joey	 Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
22	Ross	 There are naked ladies there too.
23	Joey	 Yeah.
24	Chandler	 (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.
25		Opening Credits
26	[Scene	 Bloomingdale’s, Rachel is still dressing Joshua. He is trying on a pair of pants.]
27	Joshua	 So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
28	Rachel	 Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.
29	Joshua	 (turning around) Oh! You know what I need?
30	Rachel	 Yeah!
31	Joshua	 Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
32	Rachel	 Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)
33	Joshua	 Also large?
34	Rachel	 Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
35	Joshua	 Okay.
36	Mr. Waltham	 (entering) Rachel! Could I have a moment?
37	Rachel	 Yes.
38	Mr. Waltham	 I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London—well Shropshire really but y’know—well she’s about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you’d like to keep her company this evening?
39	Rachel	 Sure. You got it. Great!
40	Mr. Waltham	 Oh, good.
41	Rachel	 Me, Fledermaus, great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)
42	Mr. Waltham	 Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
43	Joshua	 So…(Holds out his hands as to say, "Where are my gloves?")
44	Rachel	 So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)
45	Joshua	 Gloves?
46	Rachel	 Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!
47	Joshua	 Uhh, actually y’know what, I kinda—I have to take off.
48	Rachel	 Oh.
49	Joshua	 But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
50	Rachel	 No! Nothing!
51	Joshua	 I invested in this night-club and it’s opening tonight, would you like to come?
52	Rachel	 Yeah! That would be great!
53	Joshua	 You’re into hardcore S&M right?
54	Rachel	 (shocked) Well, I-I guess—I…
55	Joshua	 Kidding! (Rachel is relived) I’m gonna get there early, but I’m going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
56	Rachel	 Yeah, great, you betcha!
57	Mr. Waltham	 (entering) I almost forget the tickets, didn’t I?
58	Rachel	 What?
59	Mr. Waltham	 For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
60	Rachel	 Oh. Oh, right.
61	Mr. Waltham	 I think you’ll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
62	Rachel	 Oh yay!
63	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is in his sweats flinging playing cards into a pot.]
64	Chandler	 Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
65	Ross	 Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.
66	Joey	 (entering) Hey-hey!
67	Ross	 Hi!
68	Phoebe	 Hey!
69	Ross	 Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)
70	Joey	 Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
71	All	 (they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!
72	Monica	 You stink!
73	Ross	 Are you kidding?!
74	Joey	 Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?
75	Ross	 He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.
76	Joey	 (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How’s it going?
77		(Chandler imitates retching and gets out of the chair.)
78	Joey	 (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
79	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
80	Ross	 Hey!
81	Rachel	 Hey, Monica!
82	Monica	 Uh-oh, what’s the matter?
83	Rachel	 Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?
84	Monica	 I don’t know sweetie.
85	Rachel	 No! Help me!
86	Monica	 I can’t! I have to work!
87	Rachel	 Phoebe?
88	Phoebe	 I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
89	Rachel	 Ugh!
90	Phoebe	 Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
91	Rachel	 Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the "Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
92	Monica	 No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you smell.
93	Rachel	 Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
94	Ross	 Hi!
95	Rachel	 So….
96	Ross	 No.
97	Rachel	 Ohhhh, come on!!!
98		(There’s a knock on the door.)
99	Monica	 I think she’s here.
100	Rachel	 No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
101	Ross	 You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
102	Monica	 (looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!
103	Woman	 Hello! (Monica screams)
104	Rachel	 I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
105	Ross	 All right, I’ll do it.
106	Rachel	 Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?
107	Emily	 Yes.
108	Rachel	 I’m Rachel Green.
109	Emily	 Thank goodness.
110	Rachel	 There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…
111	Emily	 Really?! Well, that’s just lovely, isn’t it? I must’ve missed your call, even though I didn’t leave the flat all day.
112	Rachel	 Oh well, no I…
113	Emily	 Oh, no-no-no, that’s not rude! It’s perfectly in keeping with a trip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who’s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
114	Monica	 I-I-I think you look great.
115	Emily	 Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)
116		(Pause)
117	Rachel	 I’ll get her.
118	Ross	 Please hurry.
119	Phoebe	 Don’t you just love the way they talk?!
120	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next morning, Monica and Phoebe are eating breakfast.]
121	Phoebe	 Ohh!
122	Monica	 What?
123	Phoebe	 It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
124	Monica	 Oh my God!
125	Phoebe	 Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
126	Joey	 (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
127	Monica	 Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!
128	Joey	 Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
129	Monica	 Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.
130		(He opens the door to reveal Rachel.)
131	Rachel	 Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!
132	Monica	 So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
133	Rachel	 Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
134	Monica	 What?
135	Phoebe	 Why?
136	Rachel	 The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
137	Phoebe	 Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
138	Rachel	 No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
139	Monica	 So you hit her in the face?
140	Rachel	 No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
141	Phoebe	 (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.
142	Rachel	 Honey, that’s you’re name.
143	Phoebe	 That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
144		(Chandler enters from his bedroom.)
145	Monica	 Hey! You’re wearing pants!
146	Chandler	 That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
147	Monica	 It’s 9
148	Chandler	 They got a breakfast buffet.
149		(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
150	Monica	 Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!
151	Chandler	 Ooh, let me talk to him!
152	Monica	 Oh-oh, my God!
153	Chandler	 Well, can I just…
154	Monica	 (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?
155	Chandler	 She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
156	Phoebe	 Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?
157	Monica	 He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
158	Phoebe	 What? Oh my God!
159	Rachel	 What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!
160		Commercial Break
161	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, scene continued from earlier.]
162	Rachel	 They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)
163	Chandler	 Ow!
164	Rachel	 How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)
165	Chandler	 Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.
166		[cut to Ross in Vermont, talking on the phone.]
167	Ross	 When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
168	Emily	 (rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
169	Ross	 I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)
170		[cut back to Chandler and Joey’s.]
171	Monica	 He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
172	Rachel	 I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)
173	Chandler	 Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)
174	Monica	 Why do you care so much anyway?
175	Rachel	 I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
176	Monica	 Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
177	Rachel	 Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)
178	Chandler	 So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?
179	Monica	 A couple of days.
180	Chandler	 Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
181	Monica	 What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!
182	Chandler	 Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.
183	Phoebe	 Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
184	Monica	 Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
185	Chandler	 (laughs) No you can’t.
186	Phoebe	 Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
187	Chandler	 You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
188	Phoebe	 Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
189	Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to cry)
190	Phoebe	 I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)
191	[Scene	 Silvercup Studios, Joey is just arriving for his scene.]
192	Joey	 (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!
193	The A.D	 Calm down, we got time, we’re running a little late.
194		(Just then, Charlton Heston walks out of his dressing room and starts eating a liquorice whip.)
195	Joey	 Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
196	The A.D	 Yeah, we loves ‘em. I’ve never seen him with—(He gets a whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)
197	Joey	 (trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
198	The A.D	 You.
199	Joey	 Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
200	The A.D	 You?
201	Joey	 No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.
202	The A.D	 What?
203	Joey	 Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
204	The A.D	 There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
205	Joey	 Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
206	The A.D	 The one with "Heston" on it.
207	Joey	 Interesting.
208	[Scene	 A strip club, the girls are there with Chandler, who isn’t enjoying himself.]
209	Monica	 (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
210	Chandler	 No thanks, Mom!
211		(A man sits down next to Phoebe and lights up a cigarette.)
212	Phoebe	 Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause I’m pregnant.
213	The Cigarette Smoking Guy	 (No, not the Cigarette Smoking Man from The X-Files.) Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
214	Phoebe	 Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)
215		(The dancer finishes and everyone claps.)
216	Monica	 Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot pants) so good.
217	Phoebe	 (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
218	Rachel	 (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
219	Phoebe	 Come on! Look where you are!!
220	Monica	 (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
221	Phoebe	 Remember, a virgin for me please.
222	Monica	 Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
223	Chandler	 Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.
224	Phoebe	 Well, if you think it will help.
225	Chandler	 No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice
226	Phoebe	 You should! How is she?
227	Chandler	 Ohhh!!
228	Monica	 I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
229	[Scene	 Silvercup studios, Joey is taking a shower in Charlton Heston’s dressing room. Heston enters the room, Joey panics, and walks over to the shower and confronts Joey about the use of his shower.]
230	Charlton Heston	 Hello! Who’s in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal a naked and wet Joey.)
231	Joey	 How ya doin’?
232	Charlton Heston	 Who in the hell are you?
233	Joey	 I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
234	Charlton Heston	 Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
235	Joey	 No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
236	Charlton Heston	 (shocked) You’re in this picture?
237	Joey	 Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!
238	Charlton Heston	 Joey, right?
239	Joey	 Yeah.
240	Charlton Heston	 (tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or another—opp! (Joey tries to sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won’t even watch himself.
241	Joey	 Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…
242	Charlton Heston	 Listen to me!
243	Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah.
244	Charlton Heston	 I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
245	Joey	 Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)
246	Charlton Heston	 Wait a minute! Take your pants.
247	Joey	 Yeah. Oh, yeah.
248	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are returning from the strip club.]
249	Monica	 So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
250	Chandler	 Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
251	Rachel	 (entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.
252	Phoebe	 Who, Josh?
253	Rachel	 It’s Joshua.
254	Monica	 What, he doesn’t like Josh?
255	Rachel	 No, I don’t.
256	Chandler	 All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.
257	Phoebe	 Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re girls.
258	Chandler	 Yeah?
259	Phoebe	 And do you know what girls are really good at?
260	Chandler	 Stripping!
261	Phoebe	 No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
262	Rachel	 Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)
263	Monica	 Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.
264	Chandler	 Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.
265	Monica	 Come on! Chandler!
266	Chandler	 Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)
267	Monica	 They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)
268	Phoebe	 Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
269	Monica	 Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
270	Phoebe	 Yeah.
271	Monica	 Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
272	Rachel	 See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.
273	Monica	 Oh, Chantal!
274	Rachel	 Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
275	Chandler	 (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
276	Monica	 Really?!
277	Chandler	 I am totally picturing you with all those women!
278	Monica	 That’s-that’s not Phase Three.
279	Chandler	 Well, I’m there too!
280	Rachel	 Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
281	Chandler	 Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
282	Phoebe	 Oh! What is that? What is that?
283	Chandler	 Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
284	[Scene	 Central Perk, the gang is there, minus Ross. Chandler is trying to cheer Joey up about missing Phase Two.]
285	Chandler	 Come on, let me see that smile.
286	Joey	 I don’t wanna.
287	Chandler	 Please?
288	Joey	 I wanted to go to the strip club!
289	Chandler	 I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
290	Joey	 Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)
291	Monica	 Hey!
292	Ross	 Hey!
293	Phoebe	 Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?
294	Ross	 Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!
295	Rachel	 Oh, hey!
296	Ross	 Hey! You were so right!
297	Rachel	 What?
298	Ross	 Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
299	Rachel	 Oh, hmm.
300	Ross	 I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…
301	Rachel	 Joshua.
302	Ross	 Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know.
303	Rachel	 Yeah, I…
304	Ross	 But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!
305	Rachel	 Oh, thank goodness!
306	Ross	 Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
307	Rachel	 Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)
308	Ross	 Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
309	Rachel	 No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)

312	Chandler	 All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!"
313	Phoebe	 I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.
314	Chandler	 Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
315	Monica	 Wait, now, what am I doing again?
316	Chandler	 Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
317	The Cigarette Guy	 Hi, I’m Joshua, I’m here to pick up Rachel.
318	Rachel	 No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.
319	Chandler	 What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, I’ve got to wake up!
