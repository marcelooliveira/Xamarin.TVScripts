2	[Scene	 The Hospital, Phoebe is arriving with Ross, Joey, and Rachel in tow.]
3	Phoebe	 (to the nurse) Hi.
4	Nurse	 Hi.
5	Phoebe	 Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
6	Nurse	 Okay. Have you started having contractions?
7	Phoebe	 Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
8	Nurse	 Well…
9	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
10	Ross	 It's all right.
11	Nurse	 Now, which of you is the father? (Points to Joey and Ross)
12	Phoebe	 Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
13	Nurse	 (not sure what to do with that) Okay…
14	Rachel	 I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
15	Joey	 Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
16	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
17		(Monica and Chandler come running in.)
18	Ross	 Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
19		(There's a pause as they figure out what to say.)
20	Monica	 Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
21	Chandler	 That's right.
22		(Both Rachel and Ross stare at her for a moment.)
23	Rachel	 You-you're not wearing a jacket.
24	Monica	 Oh man! I did it again!
25	Phoebe	 (standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!
26	Joey	 I gotta get the before shot!
27		(She shakes her head no.)
28		Opening Credits
29	[Scene	 The delivery room, Rachel and Ross are entering.]
30	Rachel	 Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
31	Phoebe	 What?!
32	Ross	 Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
33	Phoebe	 Oh my God, she's so stupid!
34	Ross	 Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
35	Phoebe	 That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
36	Rachel	 Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
37	Ross	 Yeah, he's head of the department.
38	Phoebe	 All right—Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
39	Monica	 What?
40	Phoebe	 I'm having my first contraction!
41	Chandler	 Oh no.
42	Phoebe	 Ooh, it's not bad.
43	Chandler	 Okay.
44	Joey	 Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)
45	Chandler	 Hey! You okay?
46	Joey	 Ooh, something hurts!
47	Phoebe	 Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
48	Joey	 Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
49		(The doctor, Dr. Harad, enters.)
50	Ross	 Hello.
51	Dr. Harad	 Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. (Exits)
52	Chandler	 Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
53	Monica	 That's what it sounded like.
54	Chandler	 All right…
55	Frank	 (entering) Hey!
56	All	 Hey!
57	Frank	 (To Phoebe) Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
58	Phoebe	 No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
59	Frank	 Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
60	Chandler	 Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
61	Frank	 Yeah.
62	[Scene	 The waiting room, Monica and Joey are sitting there.]
63	Rachel	 (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
64	Joey	 Oh my!
65	Rachel	 They're male nurses.
66	Joey	 Not in my head.
67	Rachel	 Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
68	Monica	 Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
69	Rachel	 What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
70	Monica	 Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
71	Rachel	 What?
72	Monica	 Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
73	Rachel	 Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
74	Joey	 (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…
75	Rachel	 Joey, how do you make that dirty?
76	Joey	 Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad…
77	[Scene	 The delivery room, Chandler, Frank, and Ross are with Phoebe.]
78	Joey	 (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (Throws the paper away to reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera in it.)
79	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
80	Ross	 Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
81	Joey	 Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
82	Chandler	 Really? Male nurses?
83	Joey	 Yeah, I was bummed too.
84	Chandler	 So they're going on dates? When?
85	Joey	 I think Saturday—(groans in pain again).
86	Frank	 (To Phoebe) What's with him?
87	Phoebe	 Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
88	Dr. Harad	 (entering) Okay!
89	Phoebe	 Hey.
90	Dr. Harad	 Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
91	Chandler	 This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
92	Dr. Harad	 Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
93	Chandler	 All right.
94		(Dr. Harad exits.)
95	Frank	 It's not that weird, is it?
96	Phoebe	 It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
97	Ross	 To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…
98	Phoebe	 (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
99	Ross	 Again, it's not that he…
100		(Phoebe fakes pain to get Ross looking for another doctor.)
101	[Scene	 The waiting room, Chandler is looking for Monica.]
102	Chandler	 (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
103	Monica	 Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
104	Chandler	 Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
105	Monica	 Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
106	Chandler	 Fine! Maybe I will too!
107	Joey	 (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)
108	[Scene	 The delivery room, Ross has returned with another doctor. This one, is well, younger.]
109	Ross	 Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
110	Phoebe	 Hi! And you're going into what grade?
111	Dr. Oberman	 Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early…
112	Phoebe	 (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
113	Dr. Oberman	 Oh no, I'm fully qualified to…
114	Phoebe	 Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
115		(He runs out and Frank watches him go.)
116	Frank	 Oh cool! You made him cry!
117	[Scene	 Another hospital room, Joey has now been admitted and his doctor is about to break the bad news to him, Monica, and Chandler.]
118	Joey's Doctor	 Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
119	Joey	 Umm, well, what else could it be?
120	Joey's Doctor	 It's kidney stones.
121	Joey	 Or?
122	Joey's Doctor	 Kidney stones!
123	[Scene	 The delivery room, Dr. Harad is back and checking on Phoebe.]
124	Dr. Harad	 All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
125	Phoebe	 They are. Why?
126	Dr. Harad	 They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
127	Phoebe	 Happy birthday!
128	Dr. Harad	 Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as he leaves.)
129	Rachel	 Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
130	Phoebe	 I know, it is.
131	Rachel	 Yeah!
132	Phoebe	 Can I tell you a little secret?
133	Rachel	 Yeah!
134	Phoebe	 I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
135	Rachel	 Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
136		Commercial Break
137	[Scene	 The delivery room, continued from earlier.]
138	Rachel	 Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
139	Phoebe	 Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
140	Rachel	 Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
141	Phoebe	 Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
142	Rachel	 Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
143	Phoebe	 Oh, just ask him!
144	Rachel	 Me?!
145	Phoebe	 I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
146	Rachel	 No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
147	Phoebe	 You're right.
148		(There's an awkward silence then suddenly Phoebe gets an idea.)
149	Phoebe	 Tell him it's for you.
150	[Scene	 Joey's room, his doctor, Chandler, and Monica are there.]
151	Monica	 Feeling a little better sweetie?
152	Joey	 Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
153	Monica	 Me too.
154	Ross	 (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
155	Joey's Doctor	 Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra…
156	Joey	 (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option—what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!
157	[Scene	 The delivery room, Rachel and Frank are there.]
158	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) So did you ask him?
159	Rachel	 No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
160	Phoebe	 Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
161	Dr. Harad	 (laughing) Oh Fonzie.
162	Rachel	 Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
163		(Dr. Harad drops what he's doing and stares at her.)
164	Phoebe	 Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
165	Dr. Harad	 Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
166	Rachel	 Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
167	Dr. Harad	 Yeah, that's right.
168	Monica	 (entering with Chandler) Hey!
169	Phoebe	 Hi!
170	Monica	 (To Phoebe) How are you doing?
171	Phoebe	 Okay, doctor says any minute now.
172	Frank	 Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
173	Phoebe	 Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
174		(A male nurse enters.)
175	Male Nurse	 Hey!
176	Rachel	 Hi!
177	Male Nurse	 Rachel.
178	Rachel	 Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths "He's yours." to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.
179	Dan	 Nice to meet you.
180	Monica	 Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
181	Chandler	 So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
182	Monica	 Chandler!
183	Dan	 Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
184	Chandler	 Oh.
185	Dan	 And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
186	Chandler	 Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)
187	Monica	 So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
188	Dan	 Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
189	Monica	 Oh, great!
190	Chandler	 (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
191	Delivery Room Nurse	 No.
192	Chandler	 All right. Very good.
193	Phoebe	 Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
194		[Cut to Joey's room, who's going throw his own contractions. Plus, he has Ross in a headlock.]
195	Joey	 Ohh, get these things out of me!
196	Ross	 Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
197		(Joey starts breathing hard)
198	Joey	 I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)
199	Ross	 I do too! I do too!
200	Joey	 Argh!
201	Ross	 Argh!
202	Joey	 Argh!
203	Ross	 Argh!
204	[Scene	 The waiting room, Frank is on the phone as Rachel approaches.]
205	Frank	 Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! (To Rachel) Hi!
206	Rachel	 Hi!
207	Frank	 That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
208	Rachel	 Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time.
209	Frank	 Yeah.
210	Rachel	 Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
211	Frank	 (laughs) Not to me.
212	Rachel	 Yeah, fair enough.
213	[Scene	 The delivery room, later on, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Frank are there as Dr. Harad is checking out Phoebe.]
214	Dr. Harad	 Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
215		(They all kiss her and wish her luck.)
216	Monica	 Bye Dan!
217	Dan	 Uh, bye Monica.
218	Chandler	 Bye, momi-moo.
219		(Everyone except Frank leaves.)
220	Dr. Harad	 All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
221	Phoebe	 What is that?
222		(Dan turns on the TV and the Happy Days theme song comes on.)
223	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
224	Dr. Harad	 Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
225		[Cut to Joey's room, his doctor and Ross are there.]
226	Joey's Doctor	 Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey makes a face like he is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing. (Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)
227		[Cut to the delivery room.]
228	Dr. Harad	 Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
229	Dan	 I see the head.
230	Frank	 Yes, it has a head!
231	Dr. Harad	 All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
232	Frank	 I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
233	Dr. Harad	 All right. Here's your first baby.
234		[Cut to the waiting room, a triumphant Frank rushes in.]
235	Frank	 YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
236	Chandler	 Yes!
237	Frank	 Frank Jr. Jr.!!
238	Rachel	 Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
239	Frank	 So gross! (He runs back to the delivery room.)
240		[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is about to give birth to the middle kid.]
241	Dr. Harad	 Okay. You ready to push again?
242	Phoebe	 I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
243	Frank	 Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
244		(Phoebe screams in pain, and Frank screams with her.)
245		[Cut to the waiting room, a twice triumphant Frank returns.]
246	Frank	 Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)
247		[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is at it for the last time.]
248	Frank	 Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
249	Dr. Harad	 All right, he's coming. He's coming!
250		(They both stare at the newborn.)
251	Frank	 Hey, where's his thing?
252		[Cut to the waiting room, a thrice triumphant Frank returns again.]
253	Frank	 Chandler's a girl!
254	Chandler	 Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
255	Frank	 They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
256	Chandler	 Okay, keep saying it!
257	Alice	 (running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!
258	Frank	 No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
259	Alice	 We have our babies?
260	Frank	 Yeah.
261	Alice	 (Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.
262		(They hug. And quickly that hug turns into a heated make out session, right there on the waiting room couch. Chandler, Rachel, and Monica quickly make their exits.)
263	[Scene	 Joey's room, he is recovering from his birth.]
264	Joey	 Oh my God.
265	Ross	 You did it, man.
266	Joey's Doctor	 Would you like to see them? (He hands Joey a little jar.)
267	Joey	 They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)
268	[Scene	 A hallway, Monica and Dan are talking.]
269	Dan	 So, I'll call you tomorrow.
270	Monica	 Great!
271		(Dan leaves as Chandler enters.)
272	Chandler	 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
273	Monica	 Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
274	Chandler	 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
275	Monica	 I think you're better than you think you are.
276	Chandler	 Really? Okay, so…
277	Monica	 (interrupting) Know when to stop.
278	Chandler	 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
279	Monica	 Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.
280	Chandler	 Right!
281	[Scene	 The delivery room, everyone except Rachel is there. Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are holding the babies.]
282	Monica	 I think you're my favorite.
283	Phoebe	 Which one do you have?
284	Monica	 I don't care.
285	Rachel	 (entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
286	Phoebe	 But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…
287	Rachel	 Yeah, umm, no honey.
288	Phoebe	 Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
289	All	 Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
290		(They hand her the babies and leave them alone.)
291	Phoebe	 So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
292		Ending Credits
293	[Scene	 The delivery room, everyone is hanging out with Phoebe. Frank, Alice, and the kids aren't there.]
294	Monica	 Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
295	Phoebe	 I know.
296	Rachel	 So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
297	Phoebe	 Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
298	Chandler	 So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
299	Phoebe	 They're gonna call her Chandler.
300	Chandler	 That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
301	Phoebe	 Works on you.
