2	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s apartment, everyone except Ross is decorating the tree.]
3	Chandler	 Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
4	Rachel	 That’s a good story, Grandpa.
5		(Ross enters)
6	Ross	 Hey
7	All	 Hey
8	Ross	 Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
9	Monica	 Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.
10	Phoebe	 That is nice and we’re done. TADA!
11		(Her side of the tree looks a complete mess)
12	Chandler	 I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.
13	Monica	 Oh, here.
14		(She turns the tree around so that her side, which is perfectly decorated, is showing)
15	Chandler	 See now it feels like Christmas!
16		Opening Credits
17	[Scene	 Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Joey are there.]
18	Ross	 … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
19	Rachel	 So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
20		(Joey enters)
21	Joey	 Hey you guys.
22	Chandler	 Hey Joe what’s up?
23	Joey	 I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)
24	Chandler	 I can see why that’s hard to resist.
25	Joey	 I like her so much!
26	Monica	 Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.
27	Joey	 I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
28	Chandler	 You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?
29	Ross	 I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!
30		(Janine enters)
31	Janine	 Hey guys!
32	Ross	 Hi Janine!
33	Janine	 I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.
34	Monica	 Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?
35	Janine	 Yeah, that’s what I said.
36	Monica	 Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
37	Chandler	 Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)
38	Janine	 Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of the party people.
39	Ross	 You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
40	Janine	 Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my dance partner?
41	Joey	 Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.
42	Janine	 Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why.
43	Ross	 Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
44	Janine	 Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
45	Ross	 Are you serious?
46	Monica	 We are there!
47		(Rachel laughs)
48	Chandler	 What, what are you laughing at?
49	Rachel	 Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!
50		(Gunther brings Janine a coffee)
51	Janine	 Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
52		(Janine leaves)
53	All	 Bye!
54	Ross	 Bye Janine!
55	Joey	 Did she just ask me out on a date?
56	Chandler	 I don’t think so.
57	Monica	 What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
58	Rachel	 Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.
59	Joey	 Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’
60	Rachel	 Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
61	Ross	 It was a dry day.
62	Monica	 We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!
63	Ross	 Oh my God!
64	Monica	 Oh my God!
65	Chandler	 (To Rachel) Oh my God!
66	[Scene	 The Set, Joey, Janine, Ross and Monica are walking in.]
67	Joey	 OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.
68	Ross	 Got it!
69		(They get to the main stage)
70	Ross	 Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!
71	Director	 OK, everyone gather up.
72		(Monica and Ross push to the front)
73	Monica and Ross	 ‘Scuse us
74	Director	 Here’s what’s gonna happen. The music’s gonna start, you’re gonna dance, we’re gonna tape, you don’t look at the camera. Any questions?
75	Ross	 Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
76		(He and Monica laugh)
77	Director	 Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
78	Joey	 Ross! So when is it gonna air?
79	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
80	Rachel	 Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
81	Chandler	 I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.
82	Phoebe	 Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.
83	Rachel	 We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
84	Chandler	 What? That’s terrible!
85	Phoebe	 No-no, we do it every year!
86	Chandler	 Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
87	Phoebe	 No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.
88	Rachel	 Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?
89	Chandler	 No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!
90	Phoebe	 But we have to!
91	Chandler	 No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.
92	Phoebe	 Well then, you should look with us.
93	Chandler	 Why?
94	Rachel	 Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
95	Chandler	 No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
96	Phoebe	 Oh, that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!
97	Rachel	 Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
98	Chandler	 If I help, we can find ‘em faster!
99	Rachel	 That’s right!
100		(Phoebe looks under the couch)
101	Phoebe	 Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
102	Rachel	 Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!
103		(Phoebe tips it upside down, and a shoe falls out)
104	Phoebe	 Ooh, who’s it for?
105	Rachel	 (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.
106	Phoebe	 Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
107	Rachel	 We are so gonna find them this year.
108	Chandler	 Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?
109	Rachel	 Yeah.
110	Chandler	 You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
111	Phoebe and Rachel	 No, we never do that
112		(They turn away.)
113	Chandler	 Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)
114	[Scene	 The Set, everyone is dancing.]
115	Monica	 Okay, here comes another camera.
116	Ross	 Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
117		(As the camera passes by, they start to dance really rigid, but the camera is facing the other way.)
118	Ross	 Why do they keep doing that?
119	Monica	 If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.
120	Ross	 Right.
121		(They move towards a platform, dancing really strangely as they go)
122	Ross	 Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?
123	Girl	 We learned how to dance.
124	Monica	 Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
125	Ross	 Yeah!
126		(Camera pans to Joey and Janine)
127	Janine	 Hey! You’re a good dancer!
128	Joey	 Really?
129	Janine	 Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
130	Joey	 What do you mean?
131	Janine	 Like this.
132		(She pulls Joey towards her and dances really close to him.)
133	Janine	 That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better.
134	Joey	 Uh-huh.
135	Director	 (To Joey) Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there.
136	Joey	 No-no-no-no-no we came together!
137	Director	 I don’t see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)
138	Joey	 No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
139	Director	 Really, y’think so? I don’t..
140		(He leaves, and this girl grabs Joey and starts dancing really wild.)
141		Commercial Break
142	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are there and Chandler enters.]
143	Chandler	 I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
144	Rachel	 Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
145	Phoebe	 Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
146	Chandler	 Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
147	Phoebe	 Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
148	Rachel	 Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
149	Chandler	 Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
150	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
151	Rachel	 Ha!
152	Chandler	 Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
153	Rachel	 Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
154		(Chandler does the weird clicky thing again.)
155	[Scene	 The Set, the girl is still dancing with Joey.]
156	Joey	 Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!
157	Ross	 We know!
158	Monica	 Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
159	Ross	 Okay.
160		(They dance over to him.)
161	Director	 Okay, everybody hold!
162		(Ross and Monica high-five)
163	Director	 Next on the platforms are… (He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where he’s pointing to. He points away from them) …you two! And… (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.) …You two!
164	Monica	 Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?
165	Ross	 Monica! (Pause) Would it?
166		(The director shakes his head.)
167	[Scene	 The Men’s Bathroom, the tall guy is there as Joey enters.]
168	Joey	 Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.
169	Tall Guy	 She’s nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
170	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
171	Tall Guy	 No I don’t think so.
172	Joey	 Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!
173	Tall Guy	 Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
174	Joey	 Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…
175	Tall Guy	 No, no. She’s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
176	Joey	 Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guy’s pants)
177	Tall Guy	 God! What are you, in second grade?
178	Joey	 Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)
179	[Scene	 The Set, Monica and Ross are dancing.]
180	Monica	 Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?
181	Ross	 Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!
182	Monica	 What?
183	Ross	 The routine!
184	Monica	 Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.
185	Ross	 Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!
186	Monica	 Was it really that good?
187	Ross	 We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
188	Monica	 Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
189		(They move into a space, and Ross points to his eyes and then to hers)
190	Monica	 5 6 7 8!
191		(They start the routine. However hard I try, I really cannot describe it. You will have to watch it. I’m sorry.)
192		(When they finish, they walk over to the director)
193	Ross	 So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?
194	Director	 Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
195	Monica	 Yes! (They run over to a platform)
196	Director	 (To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, they’re gonna want it for the bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it’s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody’s excitement.
197		[Cut to Joey and Janine]
198	Tall Guy	 Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
199	Director	 What’s going on over here?
200	Joey	 Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?
201	Director	 What’s the matter with you? Get out of here!
202	Joey	 Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
203		(The director pushes the Tall Guy away)
204		[Cut to Ross and Monica, who are finally on a platform!]
205	Ross	 Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
206	Monica	 I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?
207	Ross	 No!
208	Monica	 Me too!
209	Ross	 Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)
210	Monica	 Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!
211	Director	 Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)
212	Joey’s Head	 Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
213	All	 Three, Two, One!
214	Director	 Cut!
215	Joey	 No! Year! Happy No Year!
216	Director	 Okay, here’s where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that’s a wrap!
217	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler’s apartment, Chandler and Rachel are there, and Phoebe enters with the Chick and the Duck.]
218	Phoebe	 Hey! Look who I found!
219	Chandler	 Oh, hey guys!
220	Phoebe	 Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
221	Chandler	 Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
222	Phoebe	 Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!
223	Chandler	 Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?
224	Phoebe	 Hmm, how about my azzz?
225		(Rachel sits on the window seat, and knocks against it)
226	Rachel	 Hey, this is hollow.
227	Phoebe	 What?
228	Rachel	 This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!
229	Phoebe	 No, don’t look directly at them!
230	Chandler	 What?
231	Phoebe	 Alright, no, we could look at them!
232	Rachel	 Oh, this one’s for me!
233	Phoebe	 Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here.
234	Chandler	 Oh great!
235	Phoebe	 And the big one’s for me!
236	Rachel	 Ooh, let’s open them!
237	Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay!
238	Phoebe	 Hee hee!
239	Chandler	 Wait, we can’t do this.
240	Phoebe and Rachel	 Why?
241	Chandler	 I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
242	Rachel	 Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.
243	Chandler	 Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
244	Phoebe	 Will you get us better gifts?
245	Chandler	 Fine!
246		(Monica enters, and they throw the gifts behind them.)
247	Monica	 Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
248	Chandler	 That’s what you got me?
249	Phoebe	 Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
250		(Rachel leans over to look at him.)
251	[Scene	 Joey and Janine’s apartment, they both enter.]
252	Joey	 Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!
253	Janine	 Joey.
254	Joey	 Yeah?
255	Janine	 (She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him) Happy New Year.
256	Joey	 Oh, yoii. What was that for?
257	Janine	 Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
258	Joey	 Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
259	Janine	 In the moment, yeah.
260	Joey	 But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
261	Janine	 Sure, New Year’s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
262	Joey	 No.
263	Janine	 Me neither.
264	Joey	 3, 2,
265	Janine	 Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss.
266	Joey	 Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
267		(They kiss to the music of Auld Lang Syne)
268		Ending Credits
269	[Scene	 Monica and Chandler's apartment, everyone except Joey is there.]
270	Monica	 We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’
271	Rachel	 Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
272	Monica	 Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
273	Rachel	 ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
274	Monica	 What? We could do it!
275	Ross	 I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
276	Monica	 I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. (She and Ross get up)
277	Monica and Ross	 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by Monica, but she moves out of the way)
278	Monica	 I can’t do it! (Ross falls into Monica’s room)
279	Chandler	 Now you do that, you’re on TV.
