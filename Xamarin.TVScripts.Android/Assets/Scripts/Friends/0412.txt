3	Rachel	 What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)
4	Monica	 Boy, you are really not a morning person.
5	Rachel	 (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
6		(Chandler opens the door, finally.)
7	Rachel	 What is that noise?
8	Chandler	 You!
9	Joey	 It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.
10	Monica	 What kind of changes?
11	Chandler	 Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.
12		Opening Credits
13	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, it’s later that morning, everybody has gotten up and Ross and Phoebe has joined them for breakfast. Rachel is returning from shopping.]
14	Phoebe	 Hey!
15	Ross	 Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
16	Rachel	 Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
17	Phoebe	 You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.
18	Rachel	 Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
19	Phoebe	 All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
20	Ross	 Now, how will they know if you’re ready?
21	Phoebe	 Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
22	Chandler	 Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
23	Phoebe	 Okay everyone, think thick.
24	All	 Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)
25	Phoebe	 Hi! Wish me luck!
26	Monica	 Oh, good luck.
27	Joey	 Good luck. (to Monica) And I’m still right!
28	Monica	 That is sooo not true!
29	Rachel	 What?
30	Joey	 She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.
31	Chandler	 I can check that for ya.
32	Monica	 I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
33	Chandler	 Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
34	Joey	 Yeah, what’s that about?
35	Chandler	 (to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
36	Ross	 (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.
37	Rachel	 I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
38	Monica	 Yeah.
39	Joey	 Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
40	Ross	 Five.
41	Chandler	 Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
42	Rachel	 How many guesses do you get?
43	Joey	 Six.
44	Ross	 Challenge extended.
45	Monica	 Deal!
46	Ross	 Challenge excepted.
47	Joey	 All right, we’ll start with…apples.
48	Ross	 We’ll be starting with apples.
49	Chandler	 (to Ross) Stop that now!
50		(Ross reveals a bag of apples.)
51	Chandler	 Yes!
52	Joey	 Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
53	Chandler	 Diet soda.
54	Ross	 Yes. Yes. Yes. (They’re perfect so far.)
55	Chandler	 Orange juice.
56	Rachel	 No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!
57	Monica	 Ha-ha!
58	Ross	 They have another guess.
59	Rachel	 Okay, well, we won that one.
60	Joey	 Okay, the last thing…
61	Chandler	 Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)
62	Joey	 No-no, not for like another two weeks.
63	Chandler	 I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.)
64	Ross	 How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
65	Chandler	 Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.
66	Monica	 Aww, man!
67	Chandler	 All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
68	Monica	 That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
69	Rachel	 Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
70	Monica	 Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
71	Joey	 Serious?
72	Monica	 Are you scared?
73	Joey	 No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
74	Monica	 Ross will do it.
75	Ross	 Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
76	Rachel	 Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.
77	Ross	 No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
78	[Scene	 The Doctor’s office, Dr. Zane is examining Phoebe as Frank and Alice watch.]
79	Dr. Zane	 It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
80	Phoebe	 Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
81	Frank	 Well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.
82	Dr. Zane	 Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
83	Phoebe	 Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
84	Dr. Zane	 Um-hmm, five actually.
85	Phoebe	 Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
86	Dr. Zane	 We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
87	Phoebe	 That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
88	Frank	 Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
89	Alice	 Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.
90	Phoebe	 Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
91	Frank	 Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
92	Alice	 Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
93	Phoebe	 Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
94	Dr. Zane	 No, I’m sorry.
95	Phoebe	 Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!
96	Frank	 I know! Why don’t you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
97	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the game is about to begin.]
98	Monica	 You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
99	Joey	 Huh.
100	Rachel	 I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.
101	Joey	 I know.
102		(They all pause and think about it.)
103	Ross	 The test is ready.
104	All	 Yeah! Yes! (They all right into the living room, all excited.)
105	Ross	 Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.
106	All	 Oh yeah!
107		(Ross flips the coin again.)
108	Rachel	 Tails!
109	Ross	 It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.
110	Chandler	 Fears and Pet Peeves.
111	Ross	 What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?
112	Joey	 Animals dressed as humans.
113	Ross	 That’s correct. Ladies?
114	Monica	 Same category?
115	Ross	 According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
116	Monica	 Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
117	Ross	 That is correct.
118	Joey	 (to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!
119	Chandler	 His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
120	Ross	 Gentlemen, you’re pick.
121	Joey	 It’s All Relative.
122	Ross	 Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
123	Joey	 (to Chandler) Nana?
124	Chandler	 She has a real name.
125	Joey	 (answering the question) Althea!
126	Chandler	 Althea?! What are you doing?!
127	Joey	 I took a shot.
128	Chandler	 You're shooting with Althea?!
129	Ross	 Althea is correct.
130	Chandler	 Nice shooting!
131		(Ross motions for the girls to pick.)
132	Rachel	 We’ll take Literature!!
133	Ross	 Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?
134	Rachel	 Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!
135	Monica	 No!!
136	Ross	 I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
137	Monica	 I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!
138	Chandler	 Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.
139	[Scene	 The Doctor’s office, Phoebe is giving a pep talk to the petrie dish containing the embryos.]
140	Phoebe	 Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.
141	Dr. Zane	 Ready?
142	Phoebe	 Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.
143	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, the game is coming to a close.]
144	Ross	 All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
145	Rachel	 (shouting) It’s All Relative!!
146	Ross	 You don’t have to shout everything.
147	Rachel	 (shouting) I’m sorry!
148	Ross	 Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
149	Monica	 Viva Las Gaygas!
150	Chandler	 Unfortunately that is correct.
151	The Girls	 Yes!!
152	Ross	 All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!
153	All	 Ohhhh.
154	Ross	 Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
155	Monica	 You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
156	Chandler	 I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.
157	Monica	 Huh, wanna bet?
158	Chandler	 Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…
159	Monica	 How about we play for more money, say 150?
160	Ross	 150 dollars.
161	Chandler	 Say 200?
162	Ross	 200 dollars.
163	Monica	 You’re doing it again.
164	Ross	 Excuse me.
165	Rachel	 Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.
166	Monica	 We won’t. (to Chandler) 300?
167	Rachel	 Monica?!
168	Monica	 I’m just trying to spice it up!
169	Rachel	 Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
170	Monica	 I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
171	Rachel	 Oooohh that’s interesting.
172	Joey	 Hey, no way, that rooster’s family!
173	Rachel	 Throw in the duck too!
174	Joey	 What do you have against the duck?! He doesn’t make any noise!
175	Rachel	 Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
176	Joey	 Look, we are not gonna…
177	Chandler	 (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
178	Joey	 (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
179	Chandler	 But if we win, we get your apartment.
180	Joey	 Oooooh!
181	Monica	 Deal!
182		Commercial Break
183	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, only slightly later.]
184	Rachel	 Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.
185	Monica	 Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)
186	Rachel	 Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
187	Monica	 No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
188	Rachel	 All right, let’s do it.
189	Monica	 Come on!
190	Rachel	 Okay. (They go into the living room.)
191	Ross	 All right, gentlemen, you’re up first.
192	Joey	 Okay.
193	Chandler	 Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
194	Ross	 You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
195	Joey	 Big fat goalie.
196	Ross	 Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
197	Chandler	 Dangerous Liaisons.
198	Ross	 Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
199	Joey	 Weekend at Bernie’s.
200	Ross	 Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
201	Chandler	 Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s ear.)
202	Ross	 Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
203		(They both confer.)
204	Joey	 Everyday use.
205	Chandler	 Fancy.
206	Joey	 Guest.
207	Chandler	 Fancy guest.
208	Ross	 Two seconds…
209	Joey	 Uhh, 11!
210	Ross	 11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up.
211	Rachel	 All right!
212	Monica	 Come on!
213		(As they change places, they give each other the now patented Ross maneuver. If you don’t know what that means, click here to find out The One With Joey's New Girlfriend.)
214	Ross	 30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?
215	Monica	 Sandwiches!
216	Ross	 Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
217	Rachel	 14?
218	Ross	 No, 19.
219	Chandler	 Thanks man.
220	Ross	 Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
221	Monica	 Maurice.
222	Ross	 Correct, his profession was?
223	Rachel	 Space cowboy!
224	Ross	 Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
225		(The girls are stumped)
226	Rachel	 Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
227	Monica	 And processing.
228	Rachel	 He carries a briefcase.
229	Ross	 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
230	Monica	 It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
231	Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
232	Monica	 That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
233		(Ross stops the clock, signifying the end of the lightning round.)
234	Monica	 NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
235	Rachel	 Oh my God.
236	Chandler and Joey	 YEAH!!! YES!!!
237	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are carrying in the foosball table.]
238	Joey	 I call Monica’s room!
239	Chandler	 You can’t just call Monica’s room.
240	Joey	 Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I called it.
241		(Chandler grunts and turns around, sees that he’s in sight of the room, and mouths damn!)
242	Monica	 Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.
243	Joey	 What?
244	Monica	 Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!
245	Chandler	 Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.
246	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
247	Chandler	 Hey!
248	Joey	 Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
249	Phoebe	 Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.
250	Monica	 How do you feel?
251	Phoebe	 Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
252	Chandler	 Yeah, but I bet it works.
253	Monica	 Really?! How much?!
254	Phoebe	 All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
255	Joey	 Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
256	Phoebe	 Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.
257	Rachel	 (entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!
258	Chandler	 Well believe it baby!
259	Rachel	 Well I-I-I’m not moving.
260	Joey	 What?!
261	Rachel	 No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
262	Joey	 You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
263	Monica	 Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?
264	Rachel	 Noooo.
265	Monica	 All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.
266	Rachel	 What?!
267	Monica	 Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
268	Chandler	 I knew it!
269	Rachel	 I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.
270	Chandler	 Cool, girl roommate.
271		(Phoebe comes in from the bathroom as Rachel sits down in disgust.)
272	Monica	 Well?
273	Phoebe	 Nope, not knocked up yet.
274	Monica	 It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
275	Phoebe	 Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity y’know, do its jobs.
276		[Cut too later, the moving process is progressing steadily. Monica is trying to lift a heavy box, as Rachel comes in from Chandler’s bedroom.]
277	Monica	 Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
278	Rachel	 No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)
279	Monica	 I’ll take care of it.
280	Rachel	 That’s right! You do what the hand says!
281		[Cut to later, Phoebe is still in the chair and Rachel is laying down as Monica enters.]
282	Rachel	 How did it go?
283	Monica	 I lost our mattresses.
284		[Cut to still later, Rachel has now resigned herself to move and is now helping Monica. Phoebe is still on the chair.]
285	Phoebe	 (singing) "Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
286		(There’s a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)
287	Monica	 Hey!
288	Frank and Alice	 (entering) Hi!
289	Alice	 Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
290	Phoebe	 Oh. Oh.
291	Frank	 Umm, it’s a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
292	Monica	 Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
293	Alice	 So umm, you feel like taking a test? There’s only one question.
294	Phoebe	 All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
295	Alice	 Okay.
296	Frank	 Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)
297	Phoebe	 Great. (Goes to take the test.)
298		(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)
299	Rachel	 Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
300	Joey	 Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
301	Rachel	 That is not true. She did! She forced me!
302	Monica	 Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
303	Rachel	 Well it stupid, unfair question!
304	Ross	 Don’t blame the questions!
305	Chandler	 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
306	Rachel	 Will you stop calling it your apartment!
307	Joey	 But it is our apartment!
308	Rachel	 No it’s not!
309		(They all decay into massive bickering as Phoebe returns from the bathroom.)
310	Phoebe	 You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!
311	Frank	 MY SISTER’S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
312		(They all go over and hug Phoebe.)
313	Phoebe	 Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.
314	All	 Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
315		Closing Credits
316	[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are busy unpacking.]
317	Monica	 I can’t find garbage bags!
318	Rachel	 Oh, I think I saw some in here.
319		(She opens a door and they both scream at horror at what’s inside of it.)
320	Monica	 What is it?!
321	Rachel	 I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.
322	Monica	 I can’t believe we’re living here!
323	[Scene	 Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, they’re both unpacked. The big ceramic dog has found a new home in front of the window. Joey screams and runs into the living room.]
324	Chandler	 What?! What-what is it?!
325	Joey	 Did you see the size of the closets?!
326	Chandler	 I can’t believe we live here!
327		(They both sit down on the chairs and put up the foot rest.)
328	Chandler and Joey	 Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
