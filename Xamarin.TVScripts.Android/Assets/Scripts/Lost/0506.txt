6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Close up on a closed eye as birds chirp.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Loud whoosh as the eye opens and blinks. The shot changes and we see Jack lying on his back among plants. The camera shows the trees above Jack being rustled in the wind. Back to a shot of Jack, pulled back further. We see he's wearing a suit. He breathes heavily. He sits up and looks around. He gets up and sighs. Jack looks at a torn piece of paper in his hand that says "I wish" on it. The rest of it has been torn off.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[far offscreen] Help! Anyone!
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack runs through thick jungle towards the noise.]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help, Jack!
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pauses.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help! Anyone!
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack keeps running and comes to a stream.]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help!
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack rushes through the stream.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help!
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack comes to the top of a waterfall. We see Hurley in the pool below, struggling to stay afloat with a guitar case.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help!
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack dives in]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help!
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack swims over and helps him.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's okay. You're okay. Relax.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God!
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, my God!
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We can stand.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We can stand.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They stand in the water.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh. Oh, my God. It really happened.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack notices Kate lying unconscious on a rock near the pool.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate. [Jack swims over and checks on her.] Kate. Kate, can you hear me?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Inhales sharply] Oh. Jack?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you okay?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are we...
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. We're back.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[46 hours earlier]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Eloise Hawking lighting a candle and putting out her match. A door opens and squeaks off screen. Ben, Jack, Sun, and Desmond walk in the church door.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	I thought I said all of them.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond locks the door and turns around in surprise.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	This is all I could get on short notice.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Guess it'll have to do for now. All right. Let's get started.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They walk to the back of the church. Eloise opens another squeaking door and flicks the light switch.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Shall we?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They walk down a spiral, metal stair case and through a dim, stone hallway with a metal door at the end. We see a DHARMA logo on the door. The door-wheel squeaks as Eloise opens it. On the other side, we hear a loud whooshing. It's revealed to be a large pendulum at the center of the room. The walls are covered with old computer equipment. The room is fairly dim. There's an odd clicking noise, which Jack looks towards. We see a panel with a series of coordinates changing its numbers. They all inspect the map over which the pendulum is swinging. Sun sees a chalkboard with a photograph on it.]
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is this place?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	The DHARMA Initiative called it the Lamp Post. This is how they found the island.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Ben] Did you know about this place?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No. No, I didn't.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Eloise] Is he telling the truth?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	[Chuckling] Probably not.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eloise opens a drawer and pulls out a binder.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Aha. Here we go.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack inspects the photograph on the chalk board. It looks like The Island. The bottom of the photograph reads "9/23/54 - U.S. ARMY - OP 264 - TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY".]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	[Sighs] All right. I apologize if this is confusing, but... [To Jack, who is still staring at the photo] Let's pay attention, yes? The room we're standing in was constructed years ago over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy. That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world. The people who built this room, however, were only interested in one.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	The Island.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Yes. The island. They'd gathered proof that it existed. They knew it was out there somewhere, but they just couldn't find it. Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum on the theoretical notion that they should stop looking for where the island was supposed to be and start looking for where it was going to be.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pendulum whooshes.]
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you mean, "Where it was going to be"?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly, as it turned out, that the Island was always moving. Why do you think you were never rescued? Now while the movements of the Island seem random, this man and his team created a series of equations which tell us, with a high degree of probability, where it is going to be at a certain point... in time. Windows, as it were, that while open, provide a route back. Unfortunately, these windows don't stay open for very long. Yours closes... in 36 hours. [She hands the binder to Jack]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me. [Chuckles] Am I really hearing this? That's what this is about? You're all going back to the Island? Willingly?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes. Why are you here, Desmond?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Sighs, scoffs] I came here to deliver a message. [To Eloise] Daniel Faraday--your son--sent me here. He wanted me to tell you that he and all the people on the Island need your help. He said that only you could help them. He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben. He said you.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	But I am helping, dear.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Scoffs] Consider the message delivered.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He starts to leave.]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Desmond, but the Island isn't done with you yet.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He turns and comes back.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	This woman cost me four years of my life--four years that I'll never get back because you told me that I was supposed to go to the Island! That it was my bloody purpose! [To Jack] You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully. [Panting] These people--they're just usin' us. They're playing some kind of game, and we are just the pieces. [Lowers voice] Whatever she tells you to do... ignore it. [Normal voice, to Eloise] You say the Island's not done with me? Well, I'm done with the Island.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pendulum continues whooshing. Desmond leaves, slamming the door behind him.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Jack... the binder in your hands shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates where I believe the Island will be in little more than a day from now. There's a commercial airliner flying from L.A. to Guam. It's going to go right through our window. Ajira Airways, Flight 316. If you have any hope of the Island bringing you back, it must be that plane. You all need to be on it. It must be that flight. [Sighs] If you... want to return, you need to recreate as best you can the circumstances that brought you there in the first place. That means as many of the same people as you are able to bring with you.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us? What if we're it?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	All I can tell you is the result would be... unpredictable.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So that's it? We just get on that flight, and we just hope that it works? That's all?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	No, that's not all, Jack... at least, not for you.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eloise opening a door to an office. She and Jack step inside. Thunder rumbles in the distance.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Come on in.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ben and Sun-
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Heard what they needed to hear, and this does not concern them. [She looks through a large amount of papers on the desk.] Oh. Here we are. [She brings a battered envelope to Jack. We see it has "Jack Shephard" written on the front.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's this?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	It's John Locke's suicide note.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Thunder continues rumbling.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs] Uh... I, uh... I didn't know.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Well, why would you? Obituaries don't see fit to mention when people hang themselves, Jack.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs] Why would he kill himself?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Ohh... there are many reasons, I'm sure, but the only one that matters is this--he is going to help you get back. John is going to be a proxy. A substitute.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	A substitute for who?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Jack... who do you think? You need to, as best you can, recreate the conditions of the original flight... which is why you need to give John something of your father's. You have to get something that belonged to your father, and you need to give it to John.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	That's what you have to do.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My father... is gone. My father has been dead for three years. You want me to... [scoffs] a--and to give it to Locke?! He's in a coffin! This is ridiculous!
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is and start asking yourself whether or not you believe it's going to work. That's why it's called a leap of faith, Jack.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eloise leaves. Rain falls in the distance.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Ben in a church pew. His hands are clasped in front of his face like he's praying. A door opens over his shoulder and Jack enters. Ben doesn't react as Jack walks over and sits in the pew across from him. Jack looks around and sighs.]
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Sun?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	She left.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And Locke? I mean... his body? The coffin?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I have a friend looking after it. I'll pick it up on my way to the airport. [Ben gets up and goes to light a candle.] What did she say to you, Jack?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nothing that matters. Who is she? Why is she... helping us? How does she know all this?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Blows out his match. He looks up at the painting above the candles.] Thomas the Apostle. When Jesus wanted to return to Judea, knowing that he would probably be murdered there, Thomas said to the others, "Let us also go, that we might die with him." But Thomas was not remembered for this bravery. His claim to fame came later... when he refused to acknowledge the resurrection. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it. The story goes... that he needed to touch Jesus' wounds to be convinced.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So was he?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Of course he was. We're all convinced sooner or later, Jack. [Pause. Ben starts to leave.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are you going?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine--just a loose end that needs tying up. See you at the airport, Jack.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben opens the door, leaves, and closes it. Jack looks around, looks at the painting, and shakes his head.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack sitting at a bar. A piano plays light jazz in the background. Dishes clatter. Jack's cell phone rings, and Jack answers.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hello? Yeah, this is him. M--he did what?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and a Nurse walking outside.]
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	This is the fourth time he's left. He's gotta follow the rules, or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I understand.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and the nurse are inside a building, now.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAGICIAN	And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the Magician pull off a sheet from a glass cage. There's a rabbit inside. The audience, mostly old people, murmurs and claps. Jack approaches an old man sitting in the back row.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, Ray.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Hey, Jack.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAGICIAN	As for my next trick, I need someone to pick a card.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wanna get out of here?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	The sooner the better.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAGICIAN	[to Lady] Would you please pick one? Look at it.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Ray are walking down a hallway away from the magician. Applause in distance.]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You wanna tell me why you took off this time, Ray?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	[Chuckles] Do I really need to answer that?
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Doesn't matter. Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Door unlocks and creaks. Ray and Jack step inside Ray's bedroom. Jack notices something on the bed.]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Smiling] You packed a bag?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Of course I did. One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away. They won't ever find me either.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, Ray.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	But what would I do without my magic shows?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] Let me help you unpack, Granddad.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack unpacks the suitcase while Ray sits at a table.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	So how are you, kiddo? You seeing anyone special? Whatever happened to the girl that you brought by with you that time? The pretty one with all the freckles? What was her name?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate. We're not together anymore.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Oh. Well, look at the bright side--more time to come visit me.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'd love to, Granddad. I really would, but... I think I might be... might be going away for a while.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Where's "away" exactly?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Somewhere better than here.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	[Chuckles] TouchÃƒÂ©.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Jack pulls out a final shirt from the suitcase and finds some shoes underneath. He's visually taken back.] Are these yours, Granddad?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	No. Those were your father's. Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died. Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	These shoes... can I take them?
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Be my guest.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks into his apartment and closes the door. He flicks on the light switch and goes to the kitchen. He pours a drink and we hear the door close. Jack stops pouring and looks around. Jack hears footsteps and a light thud. Jack slowly walks through his apartment and into his bedroom where he finds someone lying on the bed. He moves closer and sees it's Kate.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate? What are you doing here?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you still going back to the Island?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Then I'm going with you.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate... what happened? Where's Aaron? Where--
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Getting up and facing Jack] No, don't ask questions. If you want me to go with you... you'll never ask me that question again. You will never ask me about Aaron. Do you understand, Jack?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thank you.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss, Jack takes off his suit-coat, and they lie on the bed.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The next morning. Jack puts some orange juice on the table. Jack goes to the kitchen and pours coffee. Kate enters.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Morning.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Morning.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sets down the coffee pot.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice. [Jack and Kate walk to the dining room] You still like milk and two sugars?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, sure. [Kate sits down and notices the shoes] Those don't make much sense for the Island. You might want to consider hiking boots.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckling] Those were my father's. [Goes to the kitchen and pours coffee while talking] When I went to pick up his body in Sydney, my dad didn't have any nice shoes. My mother wanted to have the funeral as soon as I landed back in L.A. But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet? And so I--I had these old white tennis shoes, [Jack comes out and sits down] and I just said, "Use these. Put these on him." 'Cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me. [Chuckles] Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So why don't you get rid of 'em? Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Telephone rings.]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Go ahead. I- I'll see you at the airport, okay?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[picking up the phone] Hello?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Jack. Are you there?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Yeah, what's up? Is everything all right?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Ben at the marina. He's wet, his face is bloody, and he seems to be trying to sound normal, though very much in pain.]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked, and I need you to pick up Locke's body and take it to the airport. The coffin is at Simon's Butcher Shop, corner of Grand and Hayes.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why? Wh-what's happened to you?
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Just do it. Please.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head and hangs up.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack approaching Simon's Butcher Shop. He tries the door, but it's locked. The lights are off and he doesn't see anyone inside. He knocks. Jill comes out from the back. She opens the door for him.]
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you Jill? Ben sent me.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JILL	I know who you are, Dr. Shephard. Come on in.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jill and Jack enter the back room. It's a refrigerated room with meat on hooks.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JILL	[Noticing the bag Jack is carrying] What's in the bag? [Jack stares at her.] Sorry. Ben said to give you the van. I gotta pull it around back. Give me about five minutes. [Jack nods and she leaves.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks through the room and fights John's casket. He sighs and set his bag down. He opens the coffin and we see Locke inside. Jack takes off Locke's shoes and takes out his father's from the bag. He begins putting them on Locke and chuckles.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wherever you are, John... you must be laughing your ass off that I'm actually doing this. [Sighs] Because this... this is even crazier than you were. [Exhales deeply. Takes out John's suicide note from his pocket and puts it on Locke's chest.] And here. You can have that back. I've already heard everything you had to say, John. You wanted me to go back. I'm going back. [Jack sighs and looks around. He begins closing the casket.] Rest in peace.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack standing at a counter at the airport talking to Nabil, an employee behind the desk.]
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE ON INTERCOM	Attention, passengers on flight...
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NABIL	Mr. Shephard, if you'll just bear with me. The reason for transporting Mr. Bentham to Guam?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh, it was his--these were his wishes. He wanted to be buried there.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NABIL	Who will be the recipient of the deceased upon arrival? Is there a funeral home or--
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, it's me. Me. I'll be escorting the body.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NABIL	And your relation to the deceased?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He was, uh, a friend.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NABIL	Now, Mr. Shephard, I have to inform you that due to the increased security measures [Jack turns and notices Kate walking. She seems to not want to see him.], we are required to open the casket and perform a screening. I assure you it's all done with care. Do you understand, Mr. Shephard? Mr. Shephard?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Turning back] Yes. Yes, I understand.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NABIL	[Taking out a clipboard] Then please sign here. Thank you for flying Ajira Air.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Jack turns to leave, a man behind him in the line speaks.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	My condolences.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack stops.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	I'm sorry you lost your friend.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thank you.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN OVER PA	Please remove all jackets, sweaters, jewelry and footwear. Remove all laptops and electronic devices from their cases and place them...
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Jack.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sun. Hey.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	You're surprised to see me?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I just... I thought maybe you might change your mind.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	If there's even a chance that Jin is alive, I have to be on that plane.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN ON PA	All passengers, please have your tickets and identification available for security. Please remove all jackets, sweaters... ...all laptops and electronic devices from their cases and place them in a bin.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid being brought through the airport, accompanied by a woman. His hands are under a jacket, presumably handcuffed. The woman shows her badge to a security guard. He opens a rope-gate and lets them pass. Jack and Sun stare wide-eyed.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley reading a Spanish comic book at gate 15.]
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	[Amplified voice] This is the preliminary boarding announcement for Ajira Airways Flight 316, with service to Honolulu and Guam, departing from Gate 15. For those of you on the standby list, we'll have plenty of seats available. [Hurley quickly gets up and rushes over to her counter.] We would like to invite our pre-board, first class and SkyClub passengers to board the aircraft at this time.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What do you mean "standby"? There's no standbys.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Oh, no, sir. You don't need to worry. There are... [types on keyboard] 78 seats open.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No. I bought those seats, all 78 of 'em. I'm Hugo Reyes. They're not open. They're mine. Check and see.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	[Typing] Yes, I see that. Sir, these people just want to get to their destination. Why would you not want them to be able to travel?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, it doesn't matter why. They can take the next plane.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley. [Chuckles] What are you doing here? How did you know about the...
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	All that matters is that I'm here, right?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] Well... I'm glad that you're here, man.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Long pause, Sighs] Okay, then. Let's do this. After you.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Welcome to Ajira Air. [Takes Jack's ticket] Thank you, sir. Row 8, on your left. [in background] Welcome aboard. Yes, ma'am. You may.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Thank you.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Jack walks through the plane he sees Sayid. Sayid looks up and looks like he wants to say something, but then he looks at the woman next to him and frowns, avoiding Jack's eyes. Jack sees Sun, next. She has Jin's ring in her hands. Jack sees Kate. She's keeping her head low and looking away.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You made it.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[taking off her sunglasses] Yeah, I made it.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack continues walking to his seat and sits down. Hurley enters, carrying a guitar case in front of him.]
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	That should be everybody.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben is badly beat up and his arm is in a sling. He pants.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Oh, that's okay. Go right on in.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Thanks.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Sayid both look up and Ben. Hurley jumps up.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait! What's he doing here?!
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, hey--
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, no! He can't come!
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No one told me he was gonna be here.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who told you to be here, Hugo?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Is everything okay?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes. Yes, everything's fine. Right?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yes, Jack. I'll be fine.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Are you Jack Shephard, seat 8C?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Security found this while screening your cargo. [She hands Jack the suicide note.] Now if you two don't mind taking your seats, we are gonna be pushing back for takeoff.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben and Jack go back to their seats.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What's that, Jack?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nothing. [Looking back at the people in Coach] And the other people on this plane--what's gonna happen to them?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who cares?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jet engines whirring, engines roaring, the plane moves down the runway.]
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see shots of Jack et al in the plane as it takes off. We see more shots of the group and the plane flying. The "Fasten seat belt" light goes out with a ding. Jack gets up and goes to sit next to Kate.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighing] It's pretty crazy, huh? [Chuckles]
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Which part?
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, Sayid... being... on the same plane. How did they end up here?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	They bought a ticket.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You don't think that it means something? That somehow... we're all back together?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We're on the same plane, Jack. Doesn't make us together.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN OVER P.A.	Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Ajira Air. This is your captain, Frank J. Lapidus, and on behalf of the entire flight crew, welcome aboard. Currently we're right on schedule, flying at a very comfortable 30,000 feet. So sit back, relax and enjoy the in-flight movie.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets up and approaches the cockpit.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me, ma'am?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Mr. Shephard, can I help you?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um, I need to talk to the pilot. Frank Lapidus and I are old friends, and if you could just tell him I'm onboard, I'd really appreciate it.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	All right, but you just have to go sit down because you can't be near the cockpit door when it's open.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sure. I understand.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	[on Phone] Captain, I have a passenger named Jack Shephard. He says he knows you. Okay, sir.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hangs up telephone receiver.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	[Coming out of the cockpit. He's clean shaven and doesn't have a bandage on his forehead.] Well, hello, Doc. Small world. [Jack exhales] What are you doing going to Guam?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you doing here, Frank?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Well, I picked this gig up about eight months ago. I fly this route all the time. Sometimes I take the big birds into New [Noticing the group in first class]... Delhi. Is... that Sayid? And Hurley. Wait a second. We're not going to Guam, are we?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane glides through the air at night.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs, to Ben] How can you read?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	My mother taught me. I can read, Jack, because it beats what you're doing.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's that?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Waiting for something to happen.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And what is gonna happen?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You tell me, Jack. You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you know that Locke killed himself?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No. No, I didn't.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Taking out the suicide note] They found this stuffed in his pocket. And I've been trying to get rid of it, but it's like it's... following me. [Chuckles] I know it sounds crazy, but... it feels like John needs me to read it.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Why don't you then?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sighs.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Is it because you're afraid?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Afraid of what?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Afraid that he blames you, that it's your fault he killed himself.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Was it my fault?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, Jack, it wasn't your fault. Let me give you some privacy.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben gets up and goes to the bathroom. Jack looks at the letter and opens it. We see the note says "Jack,\ I wish you had believed me.\ JL". Jack looks teary-eyed. The lights flicker and there's some turbulence. It stops for a moment, then starts more violently. The Fasten Seat Belts sign comes back on.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[To Caesar] Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	[Walking through the cabin] Fasten your seat belt, ma'am. Sir? Please put on your seat belts. Seat belt, please.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane starts to shake more violently. Lights flicker. Objects start falling out of the overhead compartments. A bright light starts shining and we hear the familiar magnetic buzzing. The flight attendant is thrown from one side of the cabin to the other. The light and noise grow more intense, then the screen is completely white and the noise stops.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack's face as he's lying in the jungle. We see the opening scenes in a rapid summary.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Continuing.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened? [Groans]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Can you get up?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. [Grunting and straining to get up.] The plane... where's the plane?
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know. After that light, I... I woke up in the jungle.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So this is it? It's just us?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not sure. Do either of you remember crashing?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Crashing? No. One second, I'm being tossed around. The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where's Sun and Sayid? [Panting] Where's Ben?
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All right. Let's spread out, search the jungle. We come across anybody from the plane, we'll--
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A vehicle approaches. We hear "Dharma Lady" by Geronimo Jackson playing on its stereo.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADIO LYRICS	[Male voice] Yeah, your kissin', it feels so right / But you had another man...
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[It's revealed to be a new-looking DHARMA van.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude...
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADIO LYRICS	...holed up last night...
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The driver stops, grabbing a rifle, and gets out to point it at Jack et al. They stare, wide eyed at the driver.]
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jin?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin lowers the rifle and looks surprised/happy. He's wearing a DHARMA jumpsuit, but we can't see the symbol.]
