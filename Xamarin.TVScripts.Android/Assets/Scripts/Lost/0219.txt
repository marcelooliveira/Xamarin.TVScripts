6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The scene opens on Rose and Bernard storing some DHARMA food on a shelf at the beach.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	So this isn't bothering you at all?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	What's "this"?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[holding a can of food] Well, this [grabbing a bag of chips] this...
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Why would a bag of potato chips bother me?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Aren't you remotely curious as to where all this came from? You're acting like we just got back from the supermarket.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, I guess I was raised never to question my blessings.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I was raised to question piles of food with weird labels that just fall out of the sky, Rose.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, honey just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you have to raise your voice.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Bad day? I had 7 weeks of bad days on the other side of the island just trying to stay alive so I could get back to you. Here -- my God, Rose -- they've built a kitchen on the beach. They've given up.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Given up? On what?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	On getting rescued.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the hatch, we see the timer at 2:00 minutes. Locke is sitting at the computer trying to sketch out the diagram from the blast door. He gets frustrated and scratches out what he's drawn. We see the timer at 1:34 then at 1:00. The alarm starts sounding more insistently. Locke closes his eyes and appears to fall asleep for a second.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[entering] Hey, you going to get that?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke enters the numbers and presses the button somewhat reluctantly. We see Jack going toward the armory.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Ana] When's the last time you went in to see him?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	A couple of hours ago. He was sleeping.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did he eat?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	No. It's 2 days now. No food. No water. Nothing to say.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know about you but I'm tired of waiting.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack goes into the armory.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Gale] I hear you've lost your appetite. [Gale doesn't respond] Okay, don't talk. I was never that good at bedside manner anyway. I'm going to change that dressing on your shoulder. If you try anything, we've got a problem. [Jack starts changing the dressing] So, Henry [Jack pauses] -- Henry. I was thinking about something you were saying before we found out who you are. This is going to sting. [he applies some disinfectant to the wound and Gale flinches] Yeah, you were saying that if you were one of them that you'd lead us into a trap, capture our people, force a trade -- us for you. Pretty good idea, Henry. And, since you are one of them, I thought now might be a good time to use it. I'm going out to the line we're not supposed to cross and telling them that we've got you. And if they want you back, it's going to cost them. And when we get Walt back you might just have been worth all the trouble.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gale makes an exhaling sound.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you say something?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	They'll never give you Walt.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see car on a city street spinning its wheels in the snow. Rose is in the car gunning the engine but not getting anywhere.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[on the sidewalk] Don't gun it. You're digging yourself in. Just tap the gas lightly.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	[rolling down the car window] With all due respect, I have been driving in snow my whole life. You mind stepping back?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, you have to rock it out. You're not going to be able...
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose continues gunning the engine and not getting anywhere.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I'm calling AAA.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Why, so they can send a tow truck? Trust me, I can do this.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard goes around behind the car to push.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Okay, ease on the gas. That's it. You're doing great. Almost. Go, go, go.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The car moves forward and Bernard falls on his face. Rose gets out of her car.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Are you okay?!
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, yeah, sure. I'm fine.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You know, I would have gotten it out eventually.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, sure. July's right around the corner.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	[laughing] Well, thanks for helping me.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Sure.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	By the way, I'm Rose.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, uh, Bernard.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Okay.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, okay, yeah.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard starts toward his own car.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Drive safe now, okay.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Yeah, you too. [Rose hesitates a moment] Uh, um, Bernard!
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Yeah?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Coffee would be nice. Yeah, okay.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Bernard walking purposefully along the beach. Scene switches to Rose with a box of DHARMAlars she's trying to give to Hurley.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I had to beat back half the group to get these. I saved them for you.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No way. I'm on a new diet. Nothing but fish and water; and fish and water.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Hurley, what are you doing, right now?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Talking to your wife.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Good. Can you get Libby and meet me at the edge of the tree line in 5 minutes? Oh, and if you can get Jin and Sun, Jenkins and that Frogurt guy -- the guy who used to make frozen yogurt.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Neil?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Yeah, and Craig -- anybody else you can get.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard? What are you up to?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I got an idea. [he walks away and goes toward a couple of redshirts] Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome come here.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back in the hatch we see Jack getting some gear together.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	I'm not so sure trading people's their thing.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, talking to him is getting us nowhere, so -- I think we can get something for him.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	You want me to come with you?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[looking over at Locke] You need to stay here.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	[handing him her gun] You need it more than I do. Do yourself a favor, man. Don't go out there alone.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate at the shore trying to pry a mussel or some type of shellfish from a rock.]
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ah, that's how it's done. [the mussel finally comes free] Aw, well look at you. That's like 4 in the last half hour. Let me call the Guinness Book.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You want help or not? Because I've got better things to do with my time.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[seeing Jack approach] Oh happy day, here comes Dr. Giggles.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, yourself.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going back out into the jungle to talk to our friend with the beard -- see if we can make a trade.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ah, the old prisoner exchange. And you're inviting me along because you want a gun, huh?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not inviting you; I'm inviting Kate. And I've already got a gun, but thanks for offering.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How the hell did you get a gun?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Does it matter?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll get my things.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Bernard on the beach with a group gathered around.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Okay, 2 months we've been on this island -- 2 months. And already we have a water trough, and we've got a food pantry. And people are taking showers in your hatch. Have you forgotten that we all crashed on this island? It's like none of you want to go home again.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	How can you say that? Of course we want to go home.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, then why aren't we doing anything about it?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, we, like, built a raft. But it got blown up.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Okay, so what are we doing now? That pallet of food had a parachute which means a plane dropped it here which means there are other planes that fly over the island. So, we are going to build a sign -- a massive sign along the beach. So that way if a plane flies over or a satellite takes pictures from up there -- we want to make damn sure that they know we're here -- that they know about us.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Maybe we should speak to Jack about this first.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, do we have to run everything by Jack? I mean, he's not the president. He's a doctor.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You're a dentist.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear some chuckling from the crowd.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Could I speak to you for just a second? Come here. [he pulls her off to the side] Honey, it is just a sign. I don't see what the harm is.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	The harm is you are telling these people about airplanes and satellites coming out of nowhere to save the day.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I'm just trying to do something. I want to get back to our life.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, the only thing you are doing is giving these people false hope.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[looking hurt] Excuse me; I have a sign to build. [going back to the group] Alright, I want to get this going right away. We've waited long enough.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Rose and Bernard sitting in a restaurant looking out over Niagara Falls].
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	It's just amazing, isn't it?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[signaling someone behind Rose] Oh, sure, it's beautiful.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You're not impressed, huh?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Yeah.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	So, what does God have to do to get your attention?
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard again signals to someone behind Rose.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard, what are you doing?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Two violinists come to the table and begin to play. Bernard gets down on one knee.]
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Rose, I've been a bachelor for 56 years, and then I met you. And we just fell into this rhythm like we had known each other forever. I always dreamed of finding somebody like you, but I'd given up hope that I ever would.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard...
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I know, I know. It's crazy. We just met 5 months ago. But 5 months is long enough because I knew after 5 minutes. [he opens an ring box] Rose, I love you. Will you marry me?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard, I'm dying. I'm sick, and I'm dying.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[to the violinists] Would you excuse us for a minute, please? [he sits down again]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I've been in remission for the last couple of years. But now it's back and this time it's not going away. My doctor says I have about a year -- maybe a little longer.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[after a moment] You haven't answered my question.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Are you sure?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, I'm sure.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Yes. Yes.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Bernard approach Charlie and Eko at their work site.]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Boy, you bunk with a guy for 48 days -- now he doesn't call or write.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Hello, Bernard.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	What have you boys got going up here?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Just working.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Listen, I've got a whole team of folks throwing together a big sign down along the beach. Hopefully, it'll get spotted by a plane or a satellite. We could sure use all the bodies we could get to help put it together.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Sorry, I'm busy.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Charlie?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah, regrets, Bernard, I've only got 2 hands, you know. Good luck, though.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, could I at least grab some of these logs? We could use them...
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	We're using them.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	For what, exactly?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	A church.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	A church?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yes.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Everybody on this island is building something. I'm trying to get us saved.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	People are saved in different ways, Bernard.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I think I liked you better when you just hit people with your stick. [he exits]
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I like you just the way you are.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back in the hatch. Locke is listening to music and getting frustrated trying to remember the diagram from the blast door. He moves on crutches toward the armory.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[to Ana] I need to talk to him.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	The gun's with Jack. The door stays closed. But if you want to talk to him -- talk to him.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[through the armory door] Henry, can you hear me? [he knocks] It's John, Henry. Henry, did you enter the numbers? Did you push the button, or not? Henry, I need to know. I want you to answer me. Answer me! Answer me, Henry!
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Henry looking creepy and smiling.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach we see Bernard dragging a pile of rocks toward a small group of people there.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	What happened to everybody? Where's Craig? Where's Frogurt? [no one responds] Okay, alright, moving on. We're going to put this sign across this entire beach which means the letters have to be really big -- about 40 feet. These black rocks will get maximum contrast with the sand.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, we're, like, going to need a lot more rocks.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Yes, Hurley, we're going to need a lot more rocks. There's a lava field about a half mile inland that's loaded with them. We're going to haul them out in 2 man teams. So, you guys double up, and I am going to start sketching out the letters in the sand. Let's do this.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, um, I can sketch the letters.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Everybody's got a job, Hurley. I do my job, you do yours.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	ÃªÂ²Â°ÃªÂµÂ­ Ã­Å¾ËœÃ«â€œ Ã¬ÂÂ¼Ã¬Ââ‚¬ Ã¬Å¡Â°Ã«Â¦Â¬ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã«â€¹Â¤ Ã­â€¢ËœÃ«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬Â§â‚¬?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	What? What'd he say?
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I think he's not so crazy about the whole carry the rocks a half mile thing.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Okay, this is going to take time. But if this is the thing that gets us off this place, isn't that worth it? [to Jin] Rome wasn't built in a day, you know. No, you don't know. Alright, let's get started. Come on.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a jeep type vehicle driving on a dirt road in Australia.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	We're lost.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	You saying we're lost doesn't make us lost, sweetheart. I know exactly where we are.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Me too. Driving around in circles in the middle of the Outback. That's why I wanted to be on a beach for our honeymoon.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see them pull into an area with a couple of buildings and a couple of people.]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Thank goodness, civilization. Bernard, let's get directions.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, I don't need directions. I told you, honey, we're not lost.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard, what's going on?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[giving her a brochure] I brought you out here because I want you to see this man. His name is Isaac of Uluru. He's helped hundreds of people. Now, I know how it looks, but believe me he's completely legit.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard, you brought me to a faith healer?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She gets out of the car, annoyed.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	He's the real deal, Rose. When I started telling people about your situation I got 3 separate calls recommending him.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	My situation? This is why you wanted to come to Australia? To bring me to some kind of a kook?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	No, he's not. Rose, I made a 10,000 dollar donation just to get you in to see him. Normally...
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	[upset] I didn't ask for this! This is -- Bernard, I have made my piece with what is happening to me.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, I haven't. I can't just do nothing, Rose. That's not me. That's not who I am. I have to try. Will you try, Rose? For me.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Rose working around her shelter area. We can hear Bernard talking to Sawyer in the background. Scene switches to Bernard and Sawyer.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	If you have time to fix your hut you have time to move some rocks. Come on, we could really use your help.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What, you got union trouble down at the sand factory, Norma Rae?
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Come on, Sawyer, I need your help. What do you say?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I say Pasadena.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard joins Rose at the water trough.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, I hope you're happy.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	About what?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	This morning I had 15 people willing to work on the sign, now I'm down to 4.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	How is that my fault?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	At the very least I expected your support. You had to go and attack me.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Have you ever stopped to think maybe the reason people are quitting is because you've got yourself a management problem?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	What is the matter with you, Rose? I am just trying to do something.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	That's right. You're always trying to do. Why can't you just let things be?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	If I didn't always have to do something you wouldn't be here.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose looks at him, then grabs her things and walks away.]
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Kate walking in the jungle.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm flattered.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, why is that?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because you chose me to go with you instead of Sawyer.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I asked Sayid first but he turned me down. And I only asked you because they don't want you. They grabbed you -- had you at gunpoint. They could have kept you but they didn't. Then again, they didn't really want me, either.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Damaged goods, both of us.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks on. Kate notices a doll on the ground.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's that?
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's a doll. [she reaches for it]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[running toward her] Wait, wait, no. No don't.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Just as Jack gets there a trap springs and they get captured in a net.]
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sorry.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Jack strung up in the net.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You okay?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh good, so you can hear me? This isn't one of theirs.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, it's not sophisticated enough. It must be one of Rousseau's traps, so hopefully she's not far from here.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It could be a week before she shows up.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack struggles in the net.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you doing?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm trying to get the gun. I can't get my arm around.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[reaching around to get the gun out of Jack's waistband] Alright. Sorry. I don't want to shoot you. Okay.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You got it?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay, ready? Got it, got it, got it.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, alright. Okay, now give me the gun.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why, what for?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going to try to shoot the rope. [Kate starts to aim] Oh, hey, hey, hey.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm a better shot than you are.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, really?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I told you. I grew up hunting with my dad. [She shoots and misses.] Damn!
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, at least they know where we are. Okay, now give me the gun.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you going to waste another bullet?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[chuckling] We'll still have 13 more to shoot each other with. Come on.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Fine. You have a better angle than mine anyway.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, that's going to be your excuse when I make the shot?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	When you make the shot.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shoots the rope and they fall to the ground.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Nice shot.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Bernard pulling a pile of rocks on to the beach. He sees Jin placing rocks along the outline of an S in the sand.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	No, no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong. I told you 3 rows -- 3 so they can see it from the air.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[annoyed] Ã¬â€¹Å“Ã­â€šÂ¤Ã«Å â€ Ã«Å’â‚¬Ã«Â¡Å“ Ã­â€¢ËœÃªÂ³ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬Å¾â€“Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Å¡â€!
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	3 rows! How hard is that?!
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Ë†â€žÃªÂµÂ´ Ã«Â°â€Ã«Â³Â´Ã«Â¡Å“ Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«â€šËœ? Ã«â€šËœÃ«Ââ€ž Ã¬â€œÂ°Ã«Â¦Â¬ Ã¬Â â€¢Ã«Ââ€žÃ«Å â€ Ã¬â€¢Å’Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Å¡â€!
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Do I just have to do everything myself?!
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Â§ÂÃ¬Â â€˜ Ã­â€¢ËœÃ¬â€¹Â¤Ã«Å¾ËœÃ¬Å¡â€? Ã­â€¢Â´Ã«Â³Â´Ã¬â€¹Å“Ã¬Â§â‚¬! [he starts to leave]
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	No, no, no. No, Jin. No, wait. Please, I just want to get my wife home. Rose. I want to get Rose home.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sorry. [he exits]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke's crutches in the sand, and Locke sitting beside them. Rose approaches.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You're in my spot.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I can move.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Can you?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, that's funny.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I guess your sense of humor got trapped under that blast door with your leg.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I saw your husband walking through the jungle hauling rocks.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	He's building a big sign in the sand so the satellites will see it. That man doesn't know the difference between an errand and a fool's errand.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, Rose, most of us don't.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	So, what are you doing down here, John? Can't remember the last time I saw you out of that hatch.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm done with the hatch.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh, now you're just frustrated. You'll be out of that splint and running around the island again in no time.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And yet, Jack said it would be at least 4 weeks.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	But, honey, you and I both know it's not going to take that long.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Back in Australia, we see Rose being led into a room.]
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSSIE WOMAN	Right this way, Rose. Please, make yourself comfortable. Isaac will be right with you.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The room is filled with crutches hanging from the high ceiling. Rose investigates a wall covered with thank you notes to Isaac. Isaac enters.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ISAAC	You must be Rose. Why don't you have a seat.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	So, um, how does this work? I sit here and you chant, pray, or what?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ISAAC	There are certain places with great energy -- spots on the Earth like the one we're above now. Perhaps this energy is geological -- magnetic. Or perhaps it's something else. And when possible I harness this energy and give it to others. May I?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He puts his hands near Rose's face and closes his eyes. He suddenly opens his eyes, looking disturbed.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	What? What, what is it?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ISAAC	I'm sorry. I can't do anything for you, Rose.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I didn't expect you to. [Rose goes to a window and looks out at Bernard talking to a young girl on crutches.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ISAAC	It's not that you can't be healed. Like I said, there's different energies. This is not the right place for you.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Where is the right place?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ISAAC	I wish I knew. I'll return your husband's donation.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Don't. I'm going to tell him you fixed me. I'm going to tell him you fixed me.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Kate and Jack walking in the jungle, in the pouring rain.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What did you mean back there?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	In the net -- you said they were sophisticated, the Others.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh, last week when the baby got sick, Claire and I went into the jungle and, uh, found another hatch.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's a medical station. There's nothing you can use; it was all cleared out, but I found some lockers. They had clothes inside -- all worn and dirty. And they were on hangers like costumes, you know. And there was a make-up kit, and a fake beard.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When were you going to tell me this?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	When you decided to let me back in the club. [Jack walks away] What, you can keep one of them locked up in the hatch for like a week and say nothing, but then when I...
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack stops as they come to a clearing.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're here.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you sure?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[pointing] That's where they took a shot at Sawyer. Right over there was where they pushed you out of the jungle with the bag on your head. And right there is where I laid my guns down. [yelling out] Hey, hey I'm back! You say you're watching us -- you hear me? We've got your man! If you want him back you're going to have to come out here! Come on out!
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack!
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know you're out there! I know you can hear me!
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack, they're not here.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll be right here 'til you talk to me! I'll be right here!
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Bernard on the beach alone adding rocks to his sign. Rose enters carrying a bowl on a tray.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I brought you some supper.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Thanks, you can just set it down there.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Where is everybody? [Bernard gives her a look] I owe you an apology.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	You don't have anything to be sorry for. It's my own damn fault I'm out here by myself.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	That's not why I'm apologizing. I lied to you. Back in Australia, Isaac -- he didn't heal me. He didn't do anything.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Of course he did.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard, he didn't heal me. But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose continues speaking to Bernard on the island as a voice over on a scene of Rose and Bernard sitting, waiting at the airport in Australia.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	When you're sick and you have got something inside you that doesn't belong there you can feel it.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Bernard get his Oceanic tickets out and leave to make a phone call or something.]
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	And after the crash I couldn't feel it anymore. At first I thought it was just shock.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Rose and Bernard back on the island] But it wasn't. It's this place.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	But you said Isaac fixed you.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I told you that so that you wouldn't spend what time we had left trying to do something.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Rose, you could just be in remission. How do you know it wasn't Isaac who healed you?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	How do you know that he didn't heal you?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I know. I know.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - At the airport, we see Rose still sitting by herself getting something out of her purse. A prescription bottle falls to the ground. Locke comes by in his wheelchair and picks them up for her.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	These yours?
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Thank you.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're welcome.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Rose and Bernard back on the island.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Trust me. I know.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	You don't want to be rescued, do you? You think if you leave it'll come back. And if you can't leave, neither can I. We won't ever leave Rose.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hug and cry.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I would offer to take down the sign, but we didn't get very far.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see an SOS sign dug in the sand.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the hatch we see Locke listening to music. Ana approaches.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Hey.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hi.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	I pressed your button.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's not my button.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Where did you go?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I just needed to stretch my legs.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke goes back to the computer and starts drawing the diagram he saw on the blast door. This time he's not frustrated and can remember easily. He smiles.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Montage: Charlie and Eko working on the church. Jin rubbing Sun's belly. Claire playing with Aaron. Hurley making hand shadow puppets for Libby. Sawyer feeding Vincent. Rose and Bernard cuddling.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Jack in the jungle sitting at a fire.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How long are you going to wait, Jack?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Until I get my voice back. Then I'm going to yell some more.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Maybe they can't hear you.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They can hear me.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sorry I kissed you.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly they hear movement and see a torch coming through the jungle. Someone is running toward them making frightened gasping sounds. He falls almost at their feet and they turn him over.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Michael.
