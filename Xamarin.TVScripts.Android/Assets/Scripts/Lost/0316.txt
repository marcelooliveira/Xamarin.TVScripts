6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Kate, Sayid, and Juliet trek across the Island. They cross a stream and Sayid stops.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's getting late. This is a good place to make camp.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll get some firewood.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll go with you.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Kate break firewood nearby trees.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You wanna talk about it?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Talk about what?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	About the week, you spent over there with them.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well after you left. I, uh, made a deal with them if I took care with Ben that they'd let me off the Island. You know I just, kept my head down, did what I was supposed to. Didn't ask any questions.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	And that's it.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's it.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks on as Jack walks away.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Meanwhile, Juliet washes some of the dirt off herself from the stream water. She notices Sayid watching her]
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	OK. Let's have it.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I want to know what you people are doing on this Island. Why you're terrorizing us. Making lists. Kidnapping children. I want to know everything. But the first thing I'd like to know is, who are you?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet simply sits quietly.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet and her sister Rachel drive up to security gates and a guard.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Hi. I'm Juliet Burke, I'm with Mittelos Bioscience.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUARD	I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Thank you.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	Well. [Both laugh] I think they're taking this whole corporate secrecy thing a little too seriously.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm never gonna fit in with these people.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Someone knocks on the car window. It's Ethan Rom.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Hey there, Dr. Burke. If you pop the trunk I'll get your bags.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Thank you.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As the gates open, Richard Alpert also arrives.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Ah you managed to find us.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I didn't even know they had an airport out there.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	I know it surprises everyone. Hi. You must be Rachel. Richard Alpert.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	Nice to meet you.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Thank you for letting us borrow your sister for a few months.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	Just promise me you'll bring her back in one piece.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	[Laughs] Well, we'll do our best. Uh, so listen, its, er, a security thing. We have to take you in the rest of the way, so, whenever you're ready we'll be waiting, right over here but please do take your time. Pleasure to meet you.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	Thanks.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Thank you.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard leaves and Juliet and Rachel face each other with sad faces.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	It's better this way.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Is this a mistake? I shouldn't go, what if you get sick again?
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	I won't. Cancer's gone. And, I'm 100% preggers thanks to you.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'll be back...
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	Yes, I know.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	...before you give birth, I promise.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	I know. Don't worry about us, OK?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	OK.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	You spent your whole life working to get here. So, don't blow it!
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I love you.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	I love you.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sisters embrace in tears.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	OK.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RACHEL	Go make us proud.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet gets in the van with Richard and Ethan ushering her. She smiles to Rachel before the door closes.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Sayid is still waiting for Juliet to reply.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who are you?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If I told you who I was. If I told you everything that I know. You'd kill me.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What you think I'll do if you don't.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Leave her alone.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Kate arrive back with firewood.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Sooner or later she'll answer my questions.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She'll answer your questions when she's ready. And you'll wait until she is. She's under my protection.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid looks on in anger, Kate in surprise, and Juliet with no real emotion, all in silence.]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, Charlie hears Aaron crying, and finds Claire asleep.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire? Claire? Claire? [To Aaron] Oh, oh, what is it? Oh, it's OK. Shh, shh, its OK. Claire? Hey. Claire. You OK?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Charlie? What's, what's going on?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Didn't you hear Aaron?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Is he OK?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Nah, he's OK. Are you alright?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, I just, feel a little bit off. I didn't sleep well. I can't believe I didn't hear him crying!
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Maybe you're coming down with something. Look why don't you let me take Aaron, and, you get some more rest.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, do you mind?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Absolutely.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Lying back down] I won't sleep long.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Across Island, Sayid angrily cuts trees with a machete. Jack and Juliet are further behind walking together.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I guess its no use asking them to wait up huh.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They'll come around. Just give them some time.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	My people kept Sayid chained to a swing-set for three days, then I dragged Kate into the jungle, handcuffed myself to her and lied about it. How much time do you think they need?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We'll be back at our beach in a couple of hours, they'll probably be over it by then. [Both laugh] You nervous?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Hell, yes.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet is at Herarat Aviation with Richard. They walk to a seating area]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	I know that erm, six months sounds like an eternity but, you're gonna be amazed at how time flies once you're there.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I can't wait to find out where there is.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Dr. Burke? Wanna have a seat, I'd like to take some of your vitals. If that's OK with you?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yeah, sure.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	You know everyone at the company's really excited about you coming down Dr. Burke. And I think your research is really gonna have a major impact on us.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet sees Richard pours a powdered substance into a glass of orange juice.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What is that?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	That, is orange juice, with a considerable amount of tranquilizer mixed in.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Pause] You want me to drink it?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Oh yes [Smiles], you're gonna wanna be asleep for the trip, Dr. Burke.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	It can be [Chuckles], kind of intense.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Er, OK, I was fine with signing all over your paperwork. Fine with agreeing to not talk to anyone in my life for six months. Fine with the fact that no-one in the medical community has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Why were you fine?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Why were you fine with those things? It seems like, er, quite a leap for a job opportunity. I mean we're not paying you that much. I think you're fine because deep down a part of you knows that the place we're taking you to is special.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Special huh.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Let me ask you something, Juliet. You took a woman, your own sister. Whose reproductive system was ravaged by chemotherapy, who was sterile. And you made her pregnant. You created life where life wasn't supposed to be. That's a gift, Juliet. You have a gift. And don't you think you're meant to do something significant with it? Where we're going, you can do just that.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Where exactly are we...
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	I can't tell you that. But what I can tell you is that, you'll see things there that you never imagined. Now, no one is forcing you to do anything, so if you change your mind we're happy to take you back to-
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet takes the glass and quickly gulps down the entire drink.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Um, you probably shouldn't have drunk that so fast.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet quickly blacks out.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She awakes to see a roof, in red light. She bolts up, but is held back. She has been shackled to a bed. Ethan draws back a curtain]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Good morning. [Juliet tries to speak] No, no, its OK. You'll be hoarse for a few hours but it gets better as the day goes on. Sorry I had to, strap you in, but the last leg is always a little bumpy. Watch your head. Give me your hand.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet gets out and walks down a submarine walkway, seeing other people sit drinking.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	We're here.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Here where?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ethan points up and Juliet climbs a ladder outside. She is on a tropical Island by a pier. Ben approaches]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Dr. Burke. My name is Benjamin Linus. [He offers his hand, and after a moment Juliet takes it] I'm really looking forward to working with you. Watch your step here.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - At the beach, Hurley cooks oatmeal with Charlie, who is caring for Aaron]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, wow, that's too much water, its going to be all soggy.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's oatmeal dude, it's supposed to be soggy.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well if it ain't three men and a baby... I counted Hugo twice. Oh what, come on I used your name.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire arrives]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey. Does anybody know where there's any aspirin?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Claire you don't look so good.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What are you doing up? You're meant to be in bed.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah no I know, I just ... my head's pounding.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I got you covered, two aspirin coming right up.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thank you.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Sawyer heads for his tent he sees Jack coming around the shoreline.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son of a bitch.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Jack? It's Jack!
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The other survivors all notice and run over. Sawyer spots Kate and sighs. Shouts and cries can be heard from the whole group as they hug Jack, Kate and Sayid. Sawyer and Jack shake hands, and Sawyer hugs Kate passionately.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The hell is she doing here?!
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The whole group turn, and notice Juliet standing a few yards away.]
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group all run around and discuss. Juliet sits alone on the beach. Hurley approaches.]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Hey.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So. You're like one of them, huh?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm Juliet.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't remember you from the dock. Where you put bags on our heads. After you shocked us.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I had the day off.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both smile weakly.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So I hear you're a doctor.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm really more of a researcher.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ahuh.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They send you over here to keep an eye on me? [Hurley nods] OK.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The last one of you guys that came over here. Ethan. He kidnapped Claire and, Charlie got upset. We buried him over there.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet looks off in the direction, an unremarkable area of woodland.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - A heart monitor flatlines in the Staff station as many Others stand in medical garb. Juliet looks upset]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	She's gone Juliet, she's dead.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	It's OK. You tried. You go ahead and take off. I'll talk to Ben.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet sits on the rocks by the sea watching the waves. Ben approaches.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant. She knew she was taking a risk.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I think it happens at conception. And if that's the case there's nothing I can do about it, at least not here.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm not sure I understand.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	The only way to see if I'm right is to take a woman off the Island, back to Miami.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, you're not taking anybody off the Island.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	In that case, there's nothing more I can do. I know you put a lot of faith in me, Ben. And I'm sorry I couldn't help you. My sister's giving birth in three months, and I haven't even been able to call her. It's time for me to go home.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet. She'll be dead before then. Her cancer is back.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben removes a document from his bag; Rachel's medical notes. Juliet studies them.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Where did you get this?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Mikhail. I'm sorry I should have told you sooner, I just didn't see what good it would do.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What good it would do?! I could have gone home, I could have been with her!
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You still can. You can go home, Juliet. Be with her in her final days, or you can stay here and help me with our problem.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why would I stay?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because if you do I will cure your sister's cancer.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm supposed to take that on faith?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You've been here for six months. You've done extensive work-ups on all of us, have you seen even a trace of cancer?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	That's here. And being that you won't let me my sister here, I'm going to need more-
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jacob said he would take care of it himself. Unless of course you don't have faith in him. Every woman on this Island needs you. If you choose to stay. I promise you, we will save Rachel's life.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - At the beach, the group discuss Juliet being among them]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Trust her? She's one of them.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not anymore. They left her behind.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh yeah, where'd they go?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I told you, I dunno.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well maybe we better ask her.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She doesn't know either.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well here's a wacky idea. Let's stick our resident Iraqi on her. Let him do what he does, then see what she says.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, I don't do that anymore.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well ain't that convenient.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	But I don't trust her, Jack. If she's so innocent, why won't she answer my questions?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire arrives and Charlie goes to her as the others continue arguing.]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just give her some time, she's afraid.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How much time?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look the fact that I trust her should be enough.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's not.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Where did Locke go?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He went with them. Right after he destroyed the sub, the sub that was gonna take me off this Island.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They were gonna let you go?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Said who?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ben.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ben. Whose life you saved.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer, lay off.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You should have let that bug-eyed bastard die.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He did it for us.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sounds like he did it for him.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	James.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Something you wanna ask me, Sawyer?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah Jack I wanna ask you why you're fighting every one of us and sticking up for one of them.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look I spent every moment over there trying to find a way off this Island-
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	-I was trying to help all of us. I was trying to get us rescued.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire suddenly spits up blood.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire ... Jack! There's something wrong with Claire!
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As everyone speaks, Jack comes over and helps Charlie. Blood has now covered Claire's hand.]
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Put her head back, put her head back. Let's get her up. How long's she been like this?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Er, she started feeling bad this morning.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Before she got back, was she showing any symptoms at all?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No she was fine.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What about water, has she been drinking enough water?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I think so, yeah.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright keep that head up.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[To Sun] What happened to her?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬Å Â¨ Ã¬Æ’ÂÃªÂ´â‚¬Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã¬â€¢Â¼?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	He said, what do you care?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks back to her tent.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kate! I need your help. I need you to go and get Jack.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Look, he's busy right now.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Please I have to talk to him.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You wanna tell me why you need Jack?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Because I think I know what's wrong with Claire.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Because I did it to her.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate grabs Jack and leads him away from the group to Juliet. Sawyer and Sayid watch on from afar]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Giving you a bad feeling in your stomach? [Sayid nods] Yeah, me too.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Claire's immune system is turning on her. She's having a latent reaction to a medication in her bloodstream.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What medication?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It was designed to keep her alive during the late stages of her pregnancy.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Designed by who?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[sighs] By me. For some reason, the women here can't have babies. The mother's body turns on the pregnancy, treats it as a foreign invader. I saw it happen over and over. Every pregnant woman on this Island died.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate chillingly glances at Sun.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	That is, every pregnant woman until Claire.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What did you do to her?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback images of on-island events overlap as Juliet explains.]
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	One of our people infiltrated your camp, and began taking blood samples, right after your plane crashed.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Ethan.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Even though Claire didn't conceive on this Island, we found that her symptoms were consistent with previous mothers so we tried to save her life.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	By kidnapping her?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No! That wasn't supposed to happen. She was our control case. I had developed a serum that I thought would reverse what was happening to her, Ethan was administering the injections. But then, you found out that he wasn't on the plane.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback of Hurley.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The census, I interviewed everyone. One of them isn't in the manifest - he wasn't on the plane.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	So, he improvised.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback of Ethan greeting Claire and Charlie in the jungle.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Hello there.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He kidnapped her, on his own. That was never the plan. Look, I know how this sounds, but without those injections, Claire would have died. Without the serum, she's going into a form of withdrawal, and if I don't treat her quickly, her immune system could shut down entirely. Jack! I can fix this. I just need the serum. Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies near the caves where you used to live. If I go right now I can be back before its too late.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause as Kate looks skeptical.]
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do it. Get moving.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet is in bed eating ice cream with Goodwin]
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Where are you?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	In bed, with you.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	[Smiles] Ahuh. And where were you?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I was just realizing, that tomorrow I will have been on this Island for three years.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Hm, well, then I better bake a cake.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss as there is a knock at the door.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Stay here.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside in the living room, Juliet examines X-ray scans. Goodwin enters.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	What have you got there?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Karl developed some X-rays for me.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	What's wrong?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Now dressed, Juliet exits her house.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	UNNAMED OTHER	Morning, Juliet.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet knocks on Ben's door. He opens it.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hi.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Can I come in?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Of course. I was just finishing Carrie. I still don't know why you picked it, but boy is it depressing-
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You have a tumor.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	When you told me about your back pain, I said that I would take some X-rays to see if it was a small fracture or a herniated disc. But that's not your problem. Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your L-4 vertebrae. [Ben examines the X-rays] You're surprised.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well you just told me I have cancer, Juliet, of course I'm surprised.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No I told you that you had a tumor.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben walks to get a glass of water.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why are you scared?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm not scared.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why are you scared, Ben? You said no one on this Island ever had cancer, you told me that.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I know what I told you, Juliet-
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You told me you could fix it. You said that, you said that you cured my sister, you lied to me!
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Strongly] No I did not lie to you!
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If you can cure cancer Ben, then why do you have it?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Pause] I don't know.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet knocks the glass out of Ben's hand, causing it to smash on the floor. Ben backs away.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I want to talk to her. I want to talk to Rachel, I want to talk to her, now!
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Its not going to happen Juliet, but I can promise you that Rachel is fine.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You, never cured her!
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I did!
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You're a liar!
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, Juliet-
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	YOU LIED TO ME!!!
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I told you the truth!
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet stands on the spot holding back her tears.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I gave you my word.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Sobbing and leans on Ben] I know. I wanna go home. I wanna go home, Ben, please. Can't you please just let me go home?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Pause] No.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He leaves, and Juliet buries her head on the kitchen counter in floods of tears.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Juliet finds a marked tree, and pulls out a case. She attempts to open it]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Step away from the case!
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Sayid approach her.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Listen to me, Sayid.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Step back.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's full of medical supplies. They're for Claire. Jack knows all about it.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jack ain't here right now is he?
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Opening the case, Sawyer finds medical supplies.]
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm telling you the truth.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You said earlier if you told me everything you knew, I'd kill you. I'm going to test the validity of that statement.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He means talk.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We don't have time for this.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We cleared our schedules. We got all the time in the world.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You know its interesting, that you two are now the camp's moral police. I'm curious, Sayid, how long was it before you told everyone on that beach exactly how many people you've tortured in your life. Do they know about Basra? And I'm sure the first thing you did when you got here, James, was to gather everyone in a circle, and tell them about the man you shot in cold blood the night before you got on the plane. So why don't we just skip the part where you two pretend to be righteous. I'm taking that medication back to Claire. And you're gonna let me. Because if she doesn't get it, she's gonna die. And the last thing, that either of you need right now, is more blood on your hands.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet takes the case and leaves.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - The first scene of 3x01 is shown, Juliet in her house, the book club, the plane crash. Ben gives his orders.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Goodwin. Ethan. There might actually be survivors. And you're one of them, a passenger, you're in shock. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go! [To Juliet] So I guess I'm out of the bookclub?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet starts walking away.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Juliet. Juliet! I was looking for you this morning. You and I need to talk.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Now?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We have some time. It's important. Take a walk with me.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Flame station, Ben and Juliet approach.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[On a walkie] Mikhail? We're here. [Static] He never has his walkie on.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What are we doing here?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	There's something I need to show you. Mikhail! It's Ben. I'm here with Juliet, we're approaching the house. [Mumbles] Don't shoot us...
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Well hurry up then.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside, Mikhail leads them in.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Did you see it?
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail. Of course we saw it. What do you have so far?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A monitor shows news reports of planes.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Oceanic Flight 815. Left Sydney Australia headed for Los Angeles, 324 people onboard including the flight crew.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I want detailed files on every single passenger.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Already working on it.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Can we uplink to Richard in Acadia Park please.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[To Juliet] Yesterday you called me a liar. I was hurt by that.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben puts on headphones and talks into a speaker.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Richard can you hear me?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A monitor shows a newspaper front page and then a park.]
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Notice today's date, this is live. OK, Richard.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The camera pans out and tilts to a woman playing with a little boy. It's Rachel. Juliet runs to the monitor crying.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh my god. Oh! Oh my god!
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	A little over two years ago, to everyone's complete surprise, Rachel's cancer went into complete remission. Shortly after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. His name is Julian. [Holds headphones] OK, thank you Richard. You'll wanna get back here as soon as you can; we may have some new visitors.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The monitor is turned off.]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh, god! No! No!
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm not a liar, Juliet.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I want to go home.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's not our agreement, you need to stay here until your work is finished.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's impossible. The mothers keep dying.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Then we'll find more mothers. Who knows, maybe there's even one on that plane.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - At the beach, Juliet arrives back with the medicine.]
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Wait, what're you doing? She's not touching Claire - she's the one who did this to her.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She can help her, Charlie.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Says who? Her? How can you even trust her?
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I do trust her. You trust me? Do you trust me?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Give us a couple of minutes here, OK?
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie leaves.]
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How long before this takes effect?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We should see results in a few hours.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet. If this doesn't work, if something happens to her. I'm not going to be able to protect you anymore. You'll be on your own.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm already on my own, Jack.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She injects Claire.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time later, Charlie is asleep holding Aaron and Claire's hands. She wakes up.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What happened?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie smiles happily, and so does Claire. Down the shore, Juliet is sitting by herself. Jack approaches her.]
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Got a tarp. A couple of blankets. Some airline pillows. Its not much but, it'll get you started. Claire's awake. There's a, a lean-to that we've been using for shade. And, everyone says that it'll be alright if you set up camp there. For now.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Thank you.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They're good people. They're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. But, eventually they're gonna need some answers.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why don't you? You keep talking about them. Why don't I ever have to explain myself to you?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You were there. You were standing right next to me when that submarine exploded. In that moment, I saw it in your eyes. You wanna get off this island more than anything else in the world. That makes you one of us.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A while later, Juliet ties the tarp, making a roof for her new tent.]
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Voiceover] Let's go over it again.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Ben and Juliet are in Ben's house]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I know what to do.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Let's go over it again. Just to be sure.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I drag Austen out into the jungle, handcuff myself to her, then tell her I was gassed, just like she was.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	And if she catches you in the lie?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'll admit to it. Tell her it was the only way to earn her trust.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Pause] Good. What then?
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They'll take me back to the beach.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Scenes and audio now overlap with Juliet tying her tarp. She watches all the survivors as they go about their daily lives]
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I know you want me to go there, but after everything we've done to them, its going to be a problem.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We've activated the implant in Claire, she should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours. By the time you get to that camp, you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'll need supplies.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Pryce is already on his way. He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop-point. Tell Jack, that you can save her. He trusts you... are you alright?
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Pause] I'm fine.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Hands Juliet a gas mask] See you in a week.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben rolls away in his wheelchair. Juliet pauses, then takes the mask. At the beach, Juliet ties part of the tarp sharply, with a cold look on her face.]
