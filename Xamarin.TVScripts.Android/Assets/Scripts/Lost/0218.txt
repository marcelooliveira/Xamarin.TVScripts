6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley and Libby jogging on the beach.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Isn't this nice?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I kind of prefer breathing.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Come on, you're doing great. You know, exercise is addictive.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wow, I can -- I can see why.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley stops and puts his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I guess I need to drop a few pounds.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Don't be so hard on yourself. It's not going to happen overnight. Some people's metabolisms are just a little slower.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not my metabolism. I'm sick.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	What? What's wrong?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Never mind. [He starts to leave.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hurley, you can trust me.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, but it's bad.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley uncovers a "pantry" full of DHARMA food in the jungle.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	When we first crashed here, I thought, this isn't all bad -- it's, like, the all mango diet. I wasn't turning any heads or nothing but I did drop a couple belt sizes. Then we found this hatch and it was full of food -- tons of food. I tried giving it all away, but I guess I kind of kept some of it for myself. I wish I could just get rid of it.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Then get rid of it.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Libby grabs a giant jar of ranch dressing and holds it out to Hurley.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	You want to change -- then change.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Montage of Hurley opening and dumping the food from his pantry while Libby laughs and encourages him.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	How do you feel?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I feel free.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Libby hug and share a little intimate moment. Suddenly Jin, Sun and other people come running from the beach.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â­Ëœ Ã¬Â°Â¾Ã¬â€¢ËœÃ«Å’â‚¬! Ã«Â­Ëœ Ã¬Â°Â¾Ã¬â€¢ËœÃ«Å’â‚¬!
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	They found something. Come on!
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Libby follow and we see people grabbing food from the supply drop.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Charlie	Risotto. Nice.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	[to Charlie] Where did this come from?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin investigates the parachute and looks up.]
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[to Sun] Ã«Ë†â€žÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬â€”Â¬ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«â€¹Â¤ Ã«â€“Â¨Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«Å“Â¨Ã«Â Â¸Ã«â€šËœÃ«Â´Â.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Locke said some kind of blast doors trapped him in the Hatch. Maybe it was because of this -- so no one would see who dropped it. Any of you guys see a plane last night?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo. I just decided not to tell.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[People start arguing over the food, sort of in the background.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT #1	Hey, give those back, man. Those are mine.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT #2	No, man. I saw them first.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT #1	No, you saw me put those in my box.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT #2	No way.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT #1	Give me my stuff, man!
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hold on, take it easy. You guys are like locusts. How about a little order here?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Shouldn't we let someone a little more trustworthy take care of this?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Like you, babynapper?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, like Hurley. Why not Hurley? He's done it before, he can do it again.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No. No way! Not me, no! Not again, no!
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Okay, hey, hey, guys, guys, how about no one's in charge, okay? I'm sure everyone can manage to just take what they need.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Great plan, Moonbeam. And after that we can sing "Kumbaya" and do trust falls.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[off-screen] You don't have to be savages about it.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[off-screen] We can do it anyway you want.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The redshirts start talking amongst themselves, divvying up the food, trading, etc. We see Hurley notice something and are shown a man standing there in his bathrobe. He walks away and Hurley follows.]
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! Hey!!
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley falls and as he gets up he notices the man's slipper on the ground.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh-oh.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley at the beach holding the slipper. Libby approaches.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hey. What are you doing?
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nothing.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Who were you looking for out there?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley tries to nonchalantly hide the slipper.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No one.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	When you ran off it sort of seemed like you were looking for someone. I tried to find you.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I kind of -- don't want to talk about it.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Sure, okay. Pretty weird, huh? So the Island won't let you lose weight -- you destroy your stash, then bang -- more food falls from the sky.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How about that?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I'm proud of you.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Proud of me for what?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Not freaking out.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Hurley wearing a bathrobe in a doctor's office.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	How's the diet coming, Hugo?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's okay. I had a salad and some chicken breast for lunch.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	That's great. It gets easier, I promise. So I heard you had a visit with your mom. How did that go?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It was good.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	You're not still mad at her, then?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nah. I know she put me in here for a reason.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	What reason was that?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The accident.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	You want to talk about that today?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Do we have to?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Hugo, you've been in here almost 2 months, now. Don't you think it's time to start getting our hands dirty? [Hurley doesn't respond.] Okay, why don't we talk about the little homework assignment that I gave you?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I was never really good at homework.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	You remember what you were supposed to do -- just make a list of things you like about yourself?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nobody else did it.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Nobody else -- meaning -- ?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, Dave didn't do it. He said it was a stupid idea.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor, but we have talked about how he could be a very negative influence.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dave's the most normal person in this place, man.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	But he doesn't want you to change, does he?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a group of patients playing basketball. Hurley enters and we see Dave playing basketball.]
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Dude, dude, I'm open, dude! [Another patient runs by him with the ball.] It's called dribbling, not drooling -- dribbling. Well, shoot it then! Shoot it! [The patient lays the ball down under the basket.] Wait -- oh, high percentage shot, excellent choice. [to Hurley] Do you want in the game, man? Go for it. Something tells me no one will care. [Hurley doesn't respond.] What's the matter with you?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nothing.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	[to the players] Dude, dude, give up the rock!
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The ball goes over Dave's head and Hurley catches it.]
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Fantastic, give it to the guy who's [shouts] not even in the game!! [to Hurley] Hey, it's taco night, dude, let's blow this pop stand. [Hurley looks away.] What?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Brooks said you're, like, negative.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Well, duh. So what, you don't want to hang out with me anymore?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nah, I don't know, it's just...
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Is that quack getting inside your head, man? Do not let him. You've got much more important things to think about.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Like what?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Like hard or soft shell, baby -- chicken or shrimp -- sour cream or hot sauce.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I guess I could eat.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Yeah, I thought so -- noche de tacos, amigo.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Locke in the bunk bed, wiggling the toes on his left leg while Jack looks on.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good. Now, can you do the other one?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke wiggles the toes on his other leg with some difficulty and pain. Jack looks at the wound on his leg.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is it broken?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Without an x-ray, you're just going to have to do with my best guess.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs Locke's leg near the wound and moves it, causing Locke to wince in pain.]
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[entering; to Locke] How are you holding up?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Depends on Jack's best guess.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[wrapping Locke's leg with gauze] There's a small fracture -- probably hairline. This will keep the swelling down until I can get a splint on it.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How long 'til I can walk on it?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're going to have to keep off it a couple of weeks. There's a wheelchair back at camp...
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No! -- I don't need a wheelchair.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We took a pair of crutches from the fuselage when we moved down the beach. [Locke nods.] Okay. I'll be back in a while.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	He could have escaped.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry?
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Henry -- during the lockdown -- I was hurt. He could have escaped. [Locke winces in pain as Jack presses into his wound.] But he came back to help me, why would he do that?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He didn't come back to help you, John. He came back because he thought his story was going to check out.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see "Henry" strung up in the armory. Sayid is questioning him.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	He was dead already. [Ana enters.] 4 months ago I was part of the search party. Henry Gale was hanging out of the basket -- neck broken.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[motioning Ana not to speak] So he was already dead?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Yes.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then you buried him and left a grave marker?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Yes.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[pulling a 20 dollar bill out his pocket] You really should have checked his wallet before you did that. I assume Henry Gale did not have any paper on which to compose his thoughts, so he had to improvise. There wasn't much space for that. [reading from the bill] "Jennifer, well, you were right. Crossing the Pacific isn't easy. I owe you a beer. I'm hiking to one of the beaches to start a signal fire. But if you're reading this I guess I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny. Always have -- always will. Yours, Henry." So tell me, how did Henry Gale write a note to his wife with a broken neck?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	[panicky] It wasn't me. I didn't kill him. You don't understand.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you know his wife's name? Did you interrogate him?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Please, just listen. I'm just a --
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How many of you are there?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	If I told you about them -- you have no idea what he'll do.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	You mean their leader -- the guy with the beard.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Him?! He's no one! Nothing!
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Where are your people?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	I can't...
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How many of you are there?!
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	You don't understand!
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[pulling a gun] Understand this --
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Hey.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You have 3 seconds to answer my question. How many of you are there? 1 --
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	He'll kill me!
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'll kill you. [He pushes the slide back on the gun.] 2...
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Sayid!
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	You can't do this! I am not a bad person!
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	3.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana pushes Sayid just as he pulls the trigger so that he misses Gale.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	What the hell is wrong with you?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[from the bunk bed] What's going on?! I heard a gun shot!
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[entering the armory] What happened?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He's a liar!
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	[to Jack] It's fine, just get him out of here.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid and Jack exit the armory.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack! Jack! Jack!
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[looking in at Locke] I've got it covered, John.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke hits the top bunk in frustration.]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	[to Ana] Thank you.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Shut up.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She locks Gale in the armory.]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eko at the beach, sawing some wood. Charlie enters, dragging the pallet from the supply drop behind him.]
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, I noticed you were building something. I thought maybe you could use this -- for whatever it is.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie. Why don't you help me?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What are you making?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[referring to a log] Hold that end.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is it a Starbucks?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Help me carry one of those logs, please.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are you going to tell me?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Not right now.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley walking through the jungle carrying the slipper. He suddenly sees a box of DHARMA "fish crackers" on the ground and after a moment's hesitation he opens it and starts shoving them in his mouth. He looks up and sees Dave standing there in pajamas and a bathrobe.]
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're not here!
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dave picks up a coconut and throws it at Hurley, hitting him in the stomach and making him spit out fish crackers. Dave picks up another coconut and looks like he's going to throw it, but he turns and runs. Hurley follows.]
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, wait!
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley running after Dave through the jungle.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait, Dave!
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dave disappears and Hurley runs out onto the beach where Eko and Charlie are working.]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are you okay, Hurley?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did either of you see a guy run through here -- in a bathrobe, with a coconut?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No. Saw a polar bear on roller blades with a mango.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I did not see anything, Hurley.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[exiting] Yeah, me either.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Hurley playing Connect 4 with Lenny.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LENNY	4, 8, 15... [He repeats the Numbers over and over throughout the scene.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, dude.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Pretty sneaky, Leonard. [Lenny wins and gathers the red pieces to his side.] You're using those magic numbers of yours as a psyche-out, are you man? Oh, yeah, that's right, you just play dumb. I'm on to your juju, man.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[eating some celery] They're just numbers, man.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	[referring to the celery] Hey. What the hell is that?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's my mid-afternoon snack.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Dude, that's celery. Celery is not a snack. Leonard's got graham crackers, man. You should snag one. He won't notice. What's he going to do -- call you a 23? [mocking Lenny] 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hike!
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Dave laugh. Hurley grabs a graham from Lenny's plate.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Here, Hugo. Here's your meds.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Thank you, nurse Lazenby.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley starts to swallow his pills.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Dude, you want to get out of here with me? Don't take the horse tranquilizer.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What do mean, get out of here?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	I mean escape, man. Me and you, A-S-A-P. They're getting to you, dude. We've got to split.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dr. Brooks says...
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Dr. Brooks does not care about you, man. He's the one prescribing that crap. What the hell is it, anyway?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Clonazepam.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	[entering] Hugo, something wrong with your meds, there?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, me and Dave were just, you know, talking about stuff.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Right, well, sorry to interrupt. Hello there, Dave.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Hello there, Dr. Brooks.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	And how are you today?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Never been saner.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	I've been taking some pictures for the bulletin board. I've got everyone except you 2. Would you guys mind?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley moves his chair over next to Dave.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Okay. Why don't you two get a little bit closer.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Are you going to make us look at the ducky, too?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley puts his arm around Dave and poses.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	[taking a Polaroid] Say cheese.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Cheese.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Queso.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Great. Okay, you -- you need a little water with that?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nope, I'm good.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley tilts the pills into his mouth.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Okay, well fine. See you later guys, thanks for the photo op.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Brooks exits. Hurley turns to Dave and sticks his tongue out, showing that he didn't take the pills.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Dude.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	The revolution has begun, man. Lay low -- when the time is right we fly.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We Sawyer with a pack of DHARMA Initiative Chocolate Cream Cookies (like Oreos). He pulls the top off, but it breaks.]
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[entering] You've got to twist it to get the frosting. Pulling it will only break the cookie.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, that's what I get for not going to the expert in the first place. What can I do you for, Deepdish?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm kind of looking for something.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Forget it. I'm done trading. I got enough food now to open a chain of mini-marts. Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, actually, I was sort of hoping you'd do me a favor. Remember when I helped you out with that tree frog -- that you killed?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I remember.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I sort of -- need some medicine.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What do you need?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's called Clonazepam.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Clonaza -- what? What the hell's that?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So you can calm down. Or, for when you're seeing things that aren't supposed to be there.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What stuff you seeing?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know, maybe like a bald guy in a bathrobe.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You mean like that guy there?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley turns, but Dave isn't there.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[laughing] Gotcha.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks angry and suddenly tackles Sawyer.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell are you doing? Get off of me.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Who the hell do you think you are?!
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[trying to get away] Let go of me.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin and Sun come out of their tent to see what's going on.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«Â­ÂÃ¬â€¢Â¼?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[punching Sawyer with each word] Pork Rinds! Barbar! Jabba! Stay Puft!
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Å¡Â° Ã¬â€¢Ë†Ã«ÂËœÃªÂ²Â Ã«â€¹Â¤, ÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã¬â€žÅ“ Ã«Ââ€žÃ¬â„¢â‚¬Ã¬Â¤ËœÃ¬Å¡â€.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Mongo! Lardo!
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let go of me. Get him off me.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«Ââ€žÃ¬â„¢â‚¬ Ã¬Â¤ËœÃ¬Å¡â€!
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin looks quite amused but goes over and tries to help.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã¬Â Å“ ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Â§Å’ Ã­â€¢Â´!
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell's the matter with you? Get off me.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin finally pulls Hurley off Sawyer.]
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell's the matter with you?
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Â§Å’ Ã­â€¢Â´.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're crazy!
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not crazy. -- I'm not crazy.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate with some crutches at the beach talking to Sawyer.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[amused] So, he just attacked you, huh?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Try to contain yourself, Freckles.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What? I'm -- I'm worried. You look like you got your ass kicked.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't you got an adventure to get to? I think Timmy fell down a well over that way.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Seriously though, why would Hurley of all people...?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I've got no idea. I didn't do nothing. He just Hulked-out on me.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	For no reason at all?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, you walk off and have yourself a nice long giggle. But steer clear -- the man is crazy.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley putting things in a backpack at his shelter on the beach. Libby approaches.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hurley? Hey, are you okay? What happened with Sawyer?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't want to talk about it.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	So, you beat him up?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I guess you know what happened, then.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I'm on your side, whatever you tell me...
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't want to talk, okay!
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He puts a large jar of peanut butter in his pack, and notices Libby staring.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	That's a lot of peanut butter.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, I'm going to need a lot of protein where I'm going.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Where are you going?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Back to the caves. No one lives there anymore, so I won't bother anybody. I'm just going to live alone and be one of those guys -- you know, the crazy guys -- with a big beard and no clothes who's naked and throws doodie at people.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hurley, you don't have to do this.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Just leave me alone. You can't help me. No one can.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley exits.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley is walking in the jungle. Suddenly his pack rips open and the peanut butter jar is split open on the ground. Hurley uses a leaf to scoop some up and eat it. He hears footsteps and sees Dave's feet with one slipper.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're not here. You were in the hospital. You can't be here.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Sorry, dude. I am here.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Hurley in Dr. Brooks' office. He's reading from a list.]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I like that I have a good relationship with my mom. I like making my grandpa, Tito, laugh. I like chicken.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Well, that last one wasn't about you, Hugo.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I like that I like chicken?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	So, tell me, how did it feel writing that? Was that difficult?
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Kind of -- I think I messed up some spelling.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	I notice that you didn't say anything about the way you look. Are you comfortable with your appearance?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not like... I can't really do anything about it, right? [Dr. Brooks just stares at him.] If I, uh -- if I w -- wasn't so fat, they never would have died.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	There were 23 people on that deck. It was built to hold 8. And it would have collapsed whether you went out there or not.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, but I did walk out there. And it did collapse. I killed them.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	It was an accident.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That was my fault.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Look, after those people died, you were in a practically catatonic state. You stopped talking, you stopped going out, you stopped sleeping. But you never stopped eating because that's how you punish yourself.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dave's right about you. You know, you're nothing but a quack.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Dave doesn't want you to lose weight, does he?
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, Dave cares about me. He's my friend.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Let me show you something.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Brooks gets the Polaroid out of Hurley's file.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	It may upset you. This is the photo I took for the bulletin board.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks at the picture with surprise and shock.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Dave isn't your friend, Hugo, because Dave doesn't exist.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the photo is a picture of Hurley sitting next to an empty chair with his arm around nothing.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley in bed sleeping. Dave enters.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Psst. Hey, wake up, dude. Finally, you could sleep through a damn NASCAR race, man.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait, you're not -- you're a hallucination. [Dave slaps him.] Ow.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Was that a hallucination?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Maybe I just imagined you slapped me? [Dave slaps him again.] Ow! Damn it.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	We can do this all night.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dr. Brooks showed me a picture from the rec room. My arm was around, like, nothingness.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Uh, Kinko's, Photoshop? What, you think they really blew up the Death Star?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Then stop talking crazy, man. Come on, we're on a clock here.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dave starts to leave, but Hurley doesn't follow.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Hey, you in or you out, dude?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley follows Dave into the hall.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Okay, come on, come on. [They see a plate of food on a cart.] Yo, check it out, Marcus didn't finish his lasagna. That is a waste, man. One for the road?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley picks up the plate and starts eating. They stop at an area where they can see a guard below them.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Shhh. Wait for it -- wait.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The guard leaves, and they continue on.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Tippy-toes, big guy. Vamanos.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They make their way into the rec room, and go to the window which is padlocked.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Okay, man. You've got the keys, hombre. You took them off Brooks' desk earlier.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks surprised when he finds them in his pocket.]
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	[giggles] Come on, man. Open it, open it.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley unlocks and opens the window.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Oh, oh, oh -- can you taste that? That is freedom, baby. You know what tastes even better than freedom? Cheeseburgers.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dave jumps down out of the window.]
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	[laughs] Come on, man, chili-fries on me. [giggles]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Sorry? What, are you kidding me?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're not real. You're trying to get me to run away and get cheeseburgers because I want cheeseburgers.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Did you take those pills, man?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, man. I'm just not coming. Look, you don't want me to get better. You don't want me to change.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	You don't need to change, man. You are fine. You're great.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, I'm not. You just want me to stay fat. You don't want me to get better. You wouldn't care if I ate myself to death.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Do not do this, man. If you don't come with me right now, you will never get out of here.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Bye, Dave.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley closes the window.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Hurley with his eyes closed. He opens them and sees Dave. He closes them again, but Dave is still there when he opens them.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	You wouldn't happen to have my slipper, would you?
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley hands him his slipper.]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Thank you. Oh, man, you got peanut butter on it. Okay, look, I know you're freaking out right now, and I'm, I'm sorry. But it's going to get a little worse before it gets better.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Worse?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Yeah, kind of. You ready, dude? [Hurley nods.] You remember that night you closed that window on me? [Hurley nods.] You remember what you did after that night?
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I realized you were imaginary.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Mmmmhmmm.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And that was a breakthrough. And a little while later Brooks let me out, and I went home to live with my mom, and I got my job at Mr. Clucks back. And I got better.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Okay, good, great, yeah -- except see, here's the thing -- uh -- none of that ever happened.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	You're still at Santa Rosa, man. You never left the hospital.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's -- not possible.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	It's hard, I know, but I mean -- all this? You, me, this island, that peanut butter -- none of it's real, man. None of it's happening. It's all in your head, my friend. The second you closed that window your brain popped a gasket. You went back into your little coma thing. And that's where you are right this very second. In your own private Idaho, inside Santa Rosa.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No. I had my mom, my friend Johnny -- I won the lottery.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Whoa, wow, awesome, dude! What numbers did you play? Leonard's numbers, right -- from the hospital? What a coincidence. You, uh, seen them around anywhere else?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The Hatch?
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Bingo! The Hatch -- with the button that you've got to push every 108 minutes or the world ends. Oh, oh, oh, and what's the code for the button? Oh yeah, the Numbers.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	But I got better. I changed.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Changed? What, are you kidding me? Take a look at yourself. You've been on a deserted island for over 2 months and you haven't dropped 10 pounds. How is that even possible, man?
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I just destroyed my stash, and I've been exercising. Libby says it won't happen over night.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Oh, right, right, right, Libby -- the mega cute blonde chick who magically appeared from the other side of the Island. Oh, oh, oh, yeah -- and who just happens to have the hots for you. Come on, man, let's take a walk.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Dave and Hurley walking through the jungle.]
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So this is all in my brain?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Every rock, every tree. Every tree frog. Even me. The real me -- the one they told you was imaginary? He went out the window, man. Right now he's probably bouncing from hot chick to hot chick, unlike me, who's really you, who's got more important things to do.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So I'm making you up?
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Well, sort of. I'm part of your subconscious, man. All the people on this island are.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What part of me are you?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	I'm the part of you that wants to wake up, man. Follow me.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see them arrive at a high cliff above the ocean.]
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	This is it, dude.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It?
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	The big finale. The answer to all your problems. A way for you to wake up, snap out of it.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't want to kill myself.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	Who said anything about killing yourself, man? This is going to bring you back to life. The only way for you to bust out is to tell your mind that you don't believe any of this.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, if I -- all this will be gone? I'll just wake up?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVE	That's right. And when you do wake up, come find me. I'm sure I miss you. See you in another life, Hurley.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dave backs up to the edge of the cliff and lets himself fall backwards, laughing all the way down.]
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dave!!
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke approach Ana, who is putting a 9mm together, in the Hatch.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack not back yet?
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Nope. He's telling everyone at the beach that we've got one of them. Something tells me people have a lot of questions about our houseguest.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I want to talk to him.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	I don't think that's on today's program.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia, but I don't care what you think. [She just stares at him.] 5 minutes. I earned 5 minutes with him.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Ana open the door to let Locke in the armory.]
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What's your name -- your real name?
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Why don't you just keep calling me Henry? I've gotten used to it.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Did you get caught on purpose? You and your people have been here for God knows how long, and you got caught in a net...
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	God doesn't know.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Excuse me?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	God doesn't know how long we've been here, John. He can't see this island any better than the rest of the world can. May I ask you a question? What possible reason could I have for putting myself through all this?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Maybe your people were looking for this place.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	This place? This place is a joke, John.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you talking about?
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer as the alarm beeped. And you know what happened? The timer went all the way down to zero, and then some funny red pictures flipped up in its place. They looked like hieroglyphics, but I'm no expert. And then things got real interesting. There was a loud clunking and a hum like a magnet -- a big magnet. It was really very frightening. And you know what happened next? Nothing happened, John. Nothing happened at all. Your timer just flipped back to 108. I never entered the numbers. I never pressed the button.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're lying.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	No, I'm done lying.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the cliff, we see Hurley looking down into the surf.]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dave!
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	[appearing] Who's Dave?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What are you doing here?
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	What are you doing here?
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How'd you know where I was?
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Jin saw you while he was fishing.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hah! Jin doesn't speak English!
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Sun was with him. She translated. Hurley, what is going on?
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No! You're just a part of me that's scared. You don't want me to wake up. Well, guess what? I'm not scared.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley takes a couple steps back toward the edge of the cliff.]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Okay, okay, Hurley, you're having some sort of panic attack. I get that. But this isn't like you.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Like me? You don't know me.
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I was starting to.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, well did you know I'm so fat that I killed 2 people? And that I have an imaginary friend?
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hurley, please, you're going to hurt yourself.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, I'm not, because this isn't happening! None of it! I'm just imagining it! This isn't real life!
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Why would you say that?
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Because in real life -- no girl like you would ever like me. Remember when I said I knew you from somewhere? Well, maybe it's because I made you up?
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	What was the man's name who broke his leg? The day of the crash on the other side of the Island, Eko brought a man with a broken leg to me for help. What was his name?
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know.
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	You don't know. You know why? Because it happened to me. His name was Donald, and I buried him. I buried a lot of people, Hurley. So don't tell me that that wasn't real. And don't tell me you made me up. It's insulting.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	When you saw me on the beach this morning was I holding a slipper?
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Not that I can remember, no. [She holds Hurley's face in her hands.] Hurley, look at me. I am real. You're real. The way I feel about you -- that's real.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She kisses him.]
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	And that was real.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Maybe you should do it one more time just to be sure.
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Ready to go back?
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They start walking back.]
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Do you really think I can, you know, change?
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Yeah, yeah I do.
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - The scene when Dr. Brooks takes the picture of Hurley and Dave repeats with some changes.]
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Why don't you get a little closer together.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley put his arm around nothing.]
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Say cheese.
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Cheese.
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	Great. So, you need some water to go with that?
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nope. I'm good.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a woman patient's profile, apparently watching Hurley.]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. BROOKS	See you later, guys. Thanks for the photo op.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The camera pans around and we see that woman is very disheveled, out-of-it, Libby.]
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Here's your pill, Libby.
