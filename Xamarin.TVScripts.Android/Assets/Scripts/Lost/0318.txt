384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Be quiet. Don't move. You want me to help you and your baby, I have answers to your questions, but you have to come with me right now. Just you and me. Nobody else.

388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	If what you said was true, that means I'm already dead. Why should I go anywhere with you?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Because there may be a hope for you yet.

400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Claire and Kate told me about that place. It was abandoned, they found nothing there.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Well that's because they didn't know where to look.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What are you going to do to me?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the DOC. Erm, date of conception. The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant give or take a day. If you got pregnant off the Island then you and your baby will probably be OK, but if you got pregnant here, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. When was the last time you and your husband had sex?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I would rather not talk about that.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Look I know that its personal, but if I know when then I...

608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This is a mistake! We can't keep letting these people go!

616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	The baby isn't Jin's. We tried to have a baby back in Korea and couldn't, and the doctor, he told me Jin was infertile.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	And then you came here.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Did you know that the average male sperm count is between sixty and eighty million? But on the Island, its five times that. We call that good odds. You ready?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	OK, now lift your shirt up a little. [She pours liquid on Sun's chest] It's cold.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Will I see the baby?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Maybe, its your first trimester so its a little iffy. If you don't see a heartbeat, don't worry about it, its just early.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	How does it work?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Well I take a measurement of the foetus and that will tell us when your baby was conceived, and then we'll know who. [Sun sighs] You OK?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I lose either way. If I'm going to live, that means the baby's not Jin's.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Do you still want to do this?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes.
