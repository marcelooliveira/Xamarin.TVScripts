The Long Con
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Leonard Dick & Steven Maeda
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Roxann Dawson
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Locke open the gun vault. The camera pans from the back wall and we see the two walk over to the main counter. Jack puts the Halliburton down and opens it.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is that all of them?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All 6 of them. And there's uh, 1 box of ammo.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack removes the box ammo and hands it to John, who puts it with rest.]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	At least we don't have to worry about running out any time soon. Jack, I'm grateful that you decided to keep them all in the same place. [Jack notices the Virgin Mary statues.] Oh, I had to take them from Charlie -- his heroin stash. I figure it might have therapeutic value, if it ever came to that.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're just going to leave it all in the statues?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You want to break 7 Virgin Maries, be my guest. I'm superstitious.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John, the combination.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're asking me because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something, that it would be irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room, rather than this being an issue of trust.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Alright, but I think we should agree, Jack, that if either of us need to open this door, we consult each other first.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Absolutely.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Right 7, left 33, right 18. You need to write it down?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nope, I got it.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Alright. And, Jack, you may want to consider locking the medicine in here, too.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why would I need to do that?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back on the beach, Sawyer is coming back to his tent from a swim and sees Charlie building a shelter nearby.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, well, now look who had to relocate to the suburbs. [Charlie doesn't respond.] Ain't that just like a woman? She keeps the house and you get the cheap-ass apartment. Man, I thought these people hated me, but I've got to hand it to you -- stealing a baby, trying to drown it -- now, that's a new low. You even made Locke take a swing at you. Hell, that's like getting Gandhi to beat his kids.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack ransacking your tent right now?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack in Sawyer's tent, looking through his stuff.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell do you think you're doing?
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[holding an Rx] You stole these from the Hatch.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You stole them from me.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They were in my stash when I left. I just took back what was mine.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	These belong to all of us, Sawyer -- to the group. You don't have a stash anymore.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Seriously, Doc, you don't want to do this. Just give me the pills. We'll forget it ever happened.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you threatening me?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Last chance, Doc. [Jack walks away.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sawyer is in bed with a woman, Cassidy.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What do you want -- right now?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Just you.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[noticing the clock] Oh, damn it!
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	What is it?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm going to be late to that meeting I told you about.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Meeting, huh? You got another date you could just say so.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time -- but I appreciate the permission. Back in flash, gorgeous. [Sawyer grabs his suitcase and it opens, spilling out money.] You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Are you serious?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	You're not serious. You just happen to have a suitcase full of cash? And you go to pick it up and the lock just happens to break?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She grabs one of the stacks of money to examine it.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Give me that.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	It's not even real. Newspaper? Are you trying to con me? What, I ask you what all the money's for and you do some song and dance about an investment or something? And then I say, "Oh, hey, I've got some money."
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look, you got me. Good for you. No harm, no foul.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	You should have done your homework. I didn't take anything from him in the divorce. I'm not even worth your trouble.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, shame on me.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	I want you to show me what you do. Show me what you do -- what you really do.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And what do I do?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Show me how to con people, Sawyer.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Sawyer in his tent putting things in order after Jack's ransacking. Kate approaches.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I like what you've done with the place.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Maid's day off. [He tries to pick up a shirt, but Kate's standing on it.] You want to move?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I heard Jack took your pain killers.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, I guess me and the Doc are on the outs. One less Christmas card I'll have to send this year.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[tossing down a magazine] Maybe that'll cheer you up. It's from the Hatch. I know you're hard up for new reading material.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The magazine is a woman's magazine called Elegant.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, as much as I'd like to learn to feather my hair [Kate laughs], I lost my damn glasses on the raft. You want to read it to me? [Kate looks at him like he's crazy.] What, you got an appointment or something?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[finding an article] Alright, "10 Ways To Tell If He's A Sensitive Man".
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	This ought to be good.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[passing by] Morning.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, John.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[suggestively] Now, there's a sensitive man.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Claire asked him to sleep down here.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on. Locke's got himself needs -- just like anyone else.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I guess that's why El Jacko and Ana-Lulu didn't ask me to join their revolution. [Kate looks surprised.] What, you didn't hear about their little army? I guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the Doc.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid shucking coconut husks on a stake. Hurley approaches.]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, man. You gonna put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up? [Sayid doesn't respond.] Lime in the coconut? The song?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you want, Hurley?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent. Did you know he's a dentist? Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us. The guy picked up Boone's signal from the Norwegian plane.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nigerian.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this. [Hurley holds up a radio.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That is a short wave radio. It's a glorified walkie-talkie.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire with a red wire -- make it stronger.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver and all we got was the French woman's message on a loop. Why would I bother?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Come on, man, I mean, it's worth...
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's worth nothing. It's a waste of time.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Just trying to cheer you up, dude.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't need cheering up.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, man. Sorry. No problem.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid notices that Hurley left the radio behind.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Ana trying to catch up with Jack in the jungle.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Hey. [Jack doesn't respond] Hey.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	You get the combo? [Jack nods.] Nice. I didn't think it would be that easy convincing your pal to give it up. That's the nice thing about you people -- you're not scared enough.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not scared enough?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Same reason we can't talk anyone into joining the army. Everyone around here actually thinks they're safe.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Trust me, Ana. No one thinks we're safe.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	So, Jack, what's the combo? [He looks at her suspiciously.] I was just kidding.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear the sound of thunder and see Sun working in her garden. She's alarmed by the sound of rustling in the bushes a couple of times, and then Vincent comes bounding out.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[relieved] Oh, Vincent! What are you doing out here? ÃªÂ±Â°ÃªÂ¸Â° Ã¬Â¡Â°Ã¬â€¹Â¬Ã­â€¢Â´, Ã«Â°Å¸Ã¬Å“Â¼Ã«Â©Â´ Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã«ÂÂ¼.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[It starts pouring rain and a bag comes down over Sun's head. Her wrists are bound and she's dragged away.]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer and Kate sitting outside Sawyer's tent. Sawyer scrambles to get under the tarp because of the rain.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, man. It's really coming down. Get under here, Freckles.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I like the rain.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[dragging Kate into the tent] Yeah, me too, if I'm under here.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear screaming.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That's Sun.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Kate run through the jungle and find Sun unconscious.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Is she alright?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She's breathing.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Go get Jack. -- Go get Jack!
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate runs off and Sawyer carries Sun back to camp.]
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What happened?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where's Jack?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer carries Sun to her tent and Jack arrives.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Was she conscious at all? Did she say anything?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nothing. Not a word.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[running to the tent] Ã¬Å¾ÂÃªÂ¸Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼, Ã¬Å¾ÂÃªÂ¸Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼!
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She's okay. She's okay.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€“Â»ÃªÂ²Å’ Ã«ÂÅ“ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She's going to be alright. You need to let me take care of her, alright, please. [to Sawyer] Where'd you find her?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I heard her scream. Found her out in the jungle about a half a click from here.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She was out cold and her hands were tied.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you mean, her hands were tied?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	They're back.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a group standing on the beach.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They told us they would leave us alone.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, John, it looks like they broke their promise.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We don't even know what happened.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do we need to know?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Where'd you find her?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Just outside her garden.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	We should to take a look around -- with guns.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	If we arm up we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, we'll wait for Sun to wake up. She'll tell us what happened. Then we're going to do something about it.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sounds like a plan.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Sawyer walking in the jungle.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	They usually don't leave any trail.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's worth a look. Let me ask you something. This whole scenario make sense to you?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you mean?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Think about it. First off, how'd she get away? The woman doesn't weigh 100 pounds soaking wet.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She was fighting for her life. People are capable of almost anything...
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You couldn't get away. You versus Sun -- hot oil death match -- my money's on you, Sheena.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thanks for your vote of confidence.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer sees something on a branch.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's a hood, just like the one they put over my head.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No it's not. This one's black, different weave. It's all in the details -- and they're wrong.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, if it wasn't them, then who? [Sawyer doesn't respond.] What are you saying, one of us did it? Who the hell would want to go after Sun?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Not much upside to scaring the crap out of 46 people -- unless you're trying to con them into joining an army.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sawyer writing $1299.00 and $1399.00 on price tags attached to some necklaces.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer. A 5 year old could tell that.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They ain't going to be looking at the necklaces. They're going to be looking at the price tags. It's all in the details, Dimples.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	What if we get caught?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We ain't going to get caught. [He puts a band aid across his nose.] Anybody goes to the cops, the only thing they're going to remember is a guy that looks like he's been in a bar fight. -- You're scared, huh?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	A little bit.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, here's the good news, baby -- everybody's scared. The thing they're scared of most is missing an opportunity.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a couple of guys getting gas, one of them coming out of the convenience store. Sawyer approaches unrolling a velvet carrying case for the necklaces.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, you guys want to buy some necklaces?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY	Where'd you get them?
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where do you think? You want to buy them, or not? [They look unsure.] Oh, forget it. [Sawyer starts to leave.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY [approaching]	Hey, how much?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	100 a piece.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	For any of them?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, yeah, taster's choice.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	I'll take the 1200 dollar one and the 1300 dollar one. Thanks. [She buys the two necklaces and Sawyer starts to leave.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY	Hey, wait.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY #2	Hang on, man. I'll buy some of those.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY	Yeah, me too. It's Gina's birthday next week.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY #2	They love their jewelry.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Cassidy share a smile.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack is taking Sun's pulse.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Jin] The pulse is good. Strong. We just need to watch her. She's going to be okay, man.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin holds Sun's hand, very concerned. Jack goes to get some water, and Kate is waiting to talk to him.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That bump on her head -- do you think she fell or that someone hit her?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia? [Jack doesn't respond.] It's just -- the Others, I -- I was out there with you. I heard that man say that if we stayed away they'd leave us alone. And we've left them alone. So why would they attack us a few days later?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, if it wasn't them then who was it?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Like I said, how well do you know Ana Lucia?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks away.]
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Ana Lucia walking on the beach.]
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	I got a couple more people interested in joining up.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, who?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Uh, the big guy who lives behind Sayid and Scott.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You mean Steve, Scott's dead.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Scott, Steve -- the point is, after what happened people are finally willing to do something.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where were you this morning?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Lots of places.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	During the rain storm.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	You think I had something to do with Sun getting grabbed? Now, where would you get an idea like that?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[entering] Jack! Jack, Sun's awake.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack arrives at Sun's tent as she's sitting up.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. How's your head? Any pain, dizziness?
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Just a little bit.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you remember anything?
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I was working in my garden when Vincent ran up. Then it started raining and there was a bag over my head and I was being dragged.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How many were there?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I don't... I didn't see anything.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Â§â‚¬ÃªÂ¸Ë† Ã«Â­ÂÃ«ÂÂ¼ÃªÂ³ Ã­â€¢Å“ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼? Ã«â€šËœÃ­â€¢Å“Ã­â€¦Å’Ã«Ââ€ž Ã«Â§ÂÃ­â€¢Â´Ã«Â´Â!
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã­â€¢Å“Ã­â€¦Å’ Ã«Â§ÂÃ­â€¢Å“ ÃªÂ²Æ’ ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å’â‚¬Ã«Â¡Å“Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬Å¡â€. I kicked and I fought, and I just ran as fast as I could and then I fell...
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[clearly upset] Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Â â€¡ÃªÂ²Å’ Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã­â€¢ËœÃªÂ³Â Ã«Â§Å’ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬Ââ€ž Ã¬Ë†ËœÃ«Å â€ Ã¬â€”â€ Ã¬â€“Â´! Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã«â€ Ë†Ã«â€œÂ¤Ã¬Ââ€ž Ã¬Å¾Â¡Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬â€¢Â¼ Ã«ÂÂ¼!
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã«Â³Â´, Ã¬Â Å“Ã«Â°Å“...
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«â€¹Ë†Ã¬â€¢Â¼! [to Jack] Gun. Gun! -- Gun.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer watching from a distance. Kate approaches.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, what's going on?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It looks like the good folks of Island Town are about to form a posse -- get themselves armed up. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Jack didn't find that horse of yours and start leading the charge in a big white hat.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana and Kate stare intently at each other.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The guns. This is all her play to get her hands on the guns. Locke -- you need to go and tell him that they're coming.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I need to tell him? [He laughs.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer, please.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Cassidy taking a shower and Sawyer brushing his teeth.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	So what's next?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Next?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Next play.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll show you the pigeon drop.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	We already did that - twice. And the Tulsa Bag Scam and the Lookie-Loo. I want to do a big one.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You want to do a big what?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	A big con.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's called a long con.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Okay, a long con. How does it work?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It works by getting someone to ask you to do something like it's their idea, but it's not their idea, it's your idea. But none of that matters because the one thing you need for the long con we ain't got -- money.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	I have money.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sorry, Cassidy, 40 grand in some mutual fund ain't money.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Remember what I told you, that I didn't get anything from the divorce?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Mmmhmm.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	I kind of lied.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kind of lied how much?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	600 grand.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, hell baby, with kind of money let's go find an island somewhere and sit on a beach drinking Mojitos 'til we go toes up.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Sawyer, for the first time in my life I'm actually happy. And it's not really about the action and the money. It's about doing this with you. Come on, one long con? And then the mojitos.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll think about it.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	[dragging Sawyer to the bedroom] Why don't you think about it in here?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Locke in the Hatch trying to find something in the pages of a book called An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. Sawyer enters.]
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doing. What are you doing?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a bunch of books thrown on the ping-pong table that Locke has presumably already looked through.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm alphabetizing.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle and you figure it's a good time to start the damn Dewey decimal system. Good thinking.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How can I help you, James?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, actually, John, I'm here to help you -- give you the heads-up.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Heads-up?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Seems Jack's on his way over here to open your little gun closet and take whatever he needs. You should know he's not alone. The whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo Rose. I'm guessing everybody's going to want to play Cowboys and Indians. And once those guns are out and about -- something tells me they ain't never going back in.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why are you telling me this?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because it'll piss off Jack. If I were you, I'd change that combination, pronto.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	But that won't work. The door will just slow him down. If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in. Will you help me?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Help you what?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Move the guns.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Move them where? [Locke doesn't respond.] Fine, you don't want to trust me -- lots of luck.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	But I can't leave the Hatch unmanned.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sure, you move the guns and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How long 'til they get here?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss. It's yours.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sawyer is sitting in a diner at a table alone. The waitress approaches, but we can't see her face.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	Steak sandwich, two beers.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thank you.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	[entering] Aw, shucks, you got a beer for me?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You want one? Ask the lady.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	[to Diane] Well, hell, I do want one. And could I get a plate of chicken salad -- white meat only -- and please, god, no celery, okay, sweetheart?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Diane's face is revealed and we can see that it's Kate's mother.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	That's how we make it here, darlin'.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	So, tell me you got her.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I got her.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	All 600 grand?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[looking uncomfortable] All 6.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	You fell for her. Oh, come on, you've got to be kidding me.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look, it's got nothing to...
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	Hey, I found that bitch.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Her name is Cassidy.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	Well, I waited 6 months while you and Cassidy played house. Now, if you think--
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't doing it.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	You know what's making you stupid right now? It's your damn hormones. You think you're in love, but you're not. You know, a tiger doesn't change his stripes, James. You're a con man, just like me. And it's not what you do, it's what you are. Do I make myself clear?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	No, you're going to do it -- because that girl, she doesn't know you one bit. But when she finds out who you are -- who you really are -- she's going to hate your guts.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well -- enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer puts some money on the table and starts to leave.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GORDY	Wait a minute, you don't walk away now. You owe me. You don't want to pay me? I'll put one in your ear, James. You and your little friend, Cassidy.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We hear the sound of the timer alarm and see Sawyer open his eyes, apparently awakened. He inputs the Numbers as Jack and Jin enter.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you doing here?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	One second, I'm like this close to the high score on Donkey Kong.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â­Ëœ ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«â€¹Â¤Ã«Â Â¤? Ã¬Â´ÂÃ¬Ââ€ž Ã«Â¹Â¨Ã«Â¦Â¬ ÃªÂºÂ¼Ã«â€šÂ´Ã¬Å¾Â.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[as the timer resets] Now, what can I do you for?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is Locke?
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't know. I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack opens the gun vault and is shocked to see that it is empty. He looks around the vault and then realizes Sawyer.]
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh-oh, it looks like we've got ourselves a break-in. Who's going to call the cops?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are they?
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't look at me. I was just pushing a button. [He's throwing an Rx bottle to Jack.] Oh yeah, I believe these are yours.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack starts to go for Sawyer but Jin stops him.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No. Ã¬â€ Å’Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«Å â€ Ã¬â€¹Â ÃªÂ²Â½ Ã¬â€œÂ°Ã¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«Â§Ë†, Ã¬Ââ€˜? ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Â§Å’ Ã­â€¢Â´.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At night on the beach, we see Locke sitting near a fire, watching Ana sharpening a stick. And Jack strides toward Locke.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John, where are they? You moved the guns. Where are they? We had an agreement!
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	An agreement that you were about to violate, Jack. [People are gathering, watching the argument.] Yes, I moved the guns.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where? Where? Where, John?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, are you going to start handing them out? How many? Who gets them? How much time before there's an accident? Another accident. I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot and now he's... He could be dead for all I know -- and that, that was my fault. I take responsibility for that and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns, too.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I want 2 guns, John!
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sorry, Jack! That's the way it's going to be, Jack!
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	2 guns! Now tell me where they are, right now!
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear the sound of 3 bullets being fired, and see people's frightened, surprised reaction. We see Sawyer walking into camp in the dark.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Locke] You gave him the guns?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[shocked] No. I hid them.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's right, Jack. He's as stupid as you are. You were so busy worrying about each other you never even saw me coming, did you? How about you listen up because I'm only going to say this once. You took my stuff. While I was off trying to get us help -- get us rescued -- you found my stash and you took it, divvied it up -- my shaving cream, my batteries, even my beer. And then something else happened, you decided these two boys here were going to tell you what to do and when to do it. Well, I'm done taking orders. And I don't want my stuff back. The shaving cream don't matter. Batteries don't matter. The only thing that matters now are guns. And if you want one you're going to have to come to me to get it! [He looks at Sayid.] Oh, you want to torture me, don't you? Show everybody how civilized you are. Go ahead, but I'll die before I give them back. And then you'll really be screwed, won't you? New sheriff in town, boys! You all best get used to it.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Cassidy at home with a briefcase full of money on the kitchen table. Sawyer enters from outside, quite agitated.]
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	What's going on? Where were you? [Sawyer doesn't respond.] Sawyer what happened?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[looking out the window] You see that black car?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Who is it?
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	His name's Gordy, my partner.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	What partner?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If I don't walk out the front door with that briefcase in the next 2 minutes we're both dead.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	What happened? That's the guy from the Mercado deal? What...?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	There is no Mercado deal! I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the get go. Cass -- you were the long con.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	[hitting him] Son of a bitch. Go to hell. Go to hell.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You've got to understand! Everything that's happened between us in the past 6 months, all of it -- that was real.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Get out! You get out!
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Listen. You can hate me all you want later, but right now you've got to listen to me. He's going to kill us -- because I told him I wasn't going to take your money.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Oh my god.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks out the window again, and then starts putting the money from the briefcase into a duffel bag.]
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look, this is him. [He's opening the curtain, revealing a black car parked outside.] Okay, this is what we're going to do. I want you to go out back through Evan's yard. There's a rental car parked out front. Go to Sioux City. I want you to check in at the Sage Flower Motel, off highway 29. [He hands her the duffel bag.] Watch TV, have a drink, and wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.. It'll all be over.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	Let me just pack a few things.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	There's no time. Remember when you said I was all you ever wanted? Well, now you know better. I love you.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CASSIDY	I love you, too.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Go. Go.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back on the beach we see Sawyer polishing his rifle. Kate approaches.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How'd you do it?
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How'd I do what?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Locke said that he left you in the Hatch when he went to hide the guns, and we both know you can't track worth a damn. So, how'd you get them?
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	A magician never tells his secrets.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You played us. You played me. All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia -- you knew I'd go to Jack. And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now, how in the world would I know all that?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Did you have anything to do with Sun?
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What kind of person do you think I am?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What kind of a person do I think you are? I don't think this has anything to do with guns, or with getting your stash back! I think you want people to hate you!
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why do you have to do this?
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You run. I con. Tiger don't change their stripes.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley sitting by a fire reading a manuscript entitled "Bad Twin" by Gary Troup. Sayid enters carrying a pole and the radio.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, check this out. I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases. It's like a mystery book.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I want to show you something.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Cool, you fixed it!
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We'll see. [handing Hurley the radio] Hold on to this. Don't expect anything. The chances of getting a signal are slim at best.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid plants the pole in the sand and turns on the radio. We hear static.]
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Static's good, right?
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, reception is good.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid changes the dial and we hear Danielle's transmission.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait, what's that?!
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's Rousseau's signal.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, crap.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[changing the dial] But this radio has a wider bandwidth.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hold it, stop! Do you hear that?!
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADIO ANNOUNCER	[spotty reception] That was the old classic "Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'" by Duke Ellington and his Orchestra, featuring Cootie Williams on the trumpet. Up next on WXR, the Glenn Miller Orchestra with "Moonlight Serenade".
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The song begins to play with good reception.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Whoa, you hear how clear that is? It's got to be close, right?
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Radio waves at this frequency bounce off the ionosphere. They can travel thousands of miles. It could be coming from anywhere.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Or, anytime. -- Just kidding, dude.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer walking in the dark jungle and stopping. Charlie approaches.]
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He never saw you, huh?
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, he was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[offering a Virgin Mary statue] Figured you'd want your friends back.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	If I wanted them I would have taken them before I told you where they were. That's not why I did it.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's not, huh?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I wanted him to look like a fool -- to feel like a fool.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, well, it looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sun can never find out what I did to her. Never.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't sweat it. They got bigger things to worry about now.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sawyer, this idea -- all of this -- what we did -- what made you... How does someone think of something like that?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sawyer and Cassidy at the back door.]
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now go.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cassidy leaves and we see Sawyer get into the passenger seat of the black car parked in front. Sawyer looks to the driver's seat and we see there's no one there.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi, 3-Mississippi, 4-Mississippi, 5-Mississippi.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer goes back into the house and gets the "real" duffel bag out from underneath the kitchen table. On the way out the door he notices a picture of himself and Cassidy and turns it face down.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We are still with Sawyer and Charlie.]
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm not a good person, Charlie. Never did a good thing in my life.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie leaves.]
