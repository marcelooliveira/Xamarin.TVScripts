6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Boone's eye. He's watching Shannon read. Sayid brings Shannon a box, as Boone looks on.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I brought you a present for helping me with the translations. I didn't have a chance to get it gift-wrapped, so -- [Shannon opens the box which contains purple flowery shoes]. I found these in the wreckage and I have no use for them personally.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	They are actually my size. Well, half a size off, but, I swear this place is actually making my feel swell.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Another mysterious force of the Island revealed.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They continue talking (though we can't hear) as the shot switches to Boone watching them. Hurley approaches.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[off camera] Yo, Boone. Question for you, dude.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You and Locke are going out hunting boar everyday, right?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What about it?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's cool, except, how come you're not coming back with any? We haven't had fresh pork on a plate in about a week, dude.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It's not like they're domesticated animals.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Maybe you guys aren't trying hard enough?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We're hunting, alright?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I hope so, because people need food, man -- solid food. This isn't a game, man.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone looks back over and Shannon and Sayid still talking, Sayid grabs Shannon's hand.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Boone with his arm around a girl, carrying tennis racket and ball, walking up steps from the tennis court to the pool area of a club.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I can't believe you ran down that last ball. And then you hit it for a winner.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NICOLE	Lucky shot.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah, I wish it was luck. [Sound of a cell phone ringing.] Is that my phone? [He answers it.] Yeah, hello.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[in a shaky voice] Boone, it's me.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon?
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah...
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What's the matter?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Um, things aren't so good.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Where are you?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[yelling at someone on her end] Get out of here! Get the hell away from me!
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon? Shannon?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Just stay out of here! Get the hell away from me!
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon, what's going on? [Shannon crying.] Alright, Shannon, just hang on, just tell me where you are. I'll come get you.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Sydney.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Sydney?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Australia.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Sayid limping along the beach. Boone approaches.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Stay away from my sister.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	For a moment you seemed to be giving me an order.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It's just a friendly suggestion.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A suggestion?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yes, and if I were you I'd listen.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What if I don't?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[off camera at first] Boone! Found some fresh tracks down by the stream.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[to Sayid] See you later.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You know where to find me.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone and Locke walk off into the jungle.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You need to put aside your differences with Sayid.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	He's hitting on Shannon.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[while they are crossing the stream on stepping stone rocks] He's very competent. We don't want to make an enemy of him. We're going to want him on our side.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	John, people are talking about what we're doing out here every day, especially since we never come back with anything.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You mean boar.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Plenty of fruit and fish to go around. What we're doing here is far more important. [They stop and uncover the hatch.] Right now, this is our priority.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Hurley picking a leaf off a plant. Jack approaches.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, Jack?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So, Hurley?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Something kind of important I'd want to ask you about. Um, anything I tell you is doctor-patient confidential, right?
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The thing is -- I haven't been feeling so great.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's the matter?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, it's kind of like, uh, my stomach. I've been having some, um, major digestive issues.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What have you been eating?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, the usual - bananas, papayas, mangoes, guava, passion fruit, coconut. Some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill. Someone said they might be good for digestion. Let me tell you, they lied.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, it might help if you had a little bit more protein in your diet.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, what can I do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You can eat fish. Jin's been catching a lot of them.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No way, man. That guy has it in for me.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] Oh, come on, man.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat, like right after we, you know, got here, um, the thing with the spikes?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sea urchin.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah. And when I turned him down it's like I soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. The guy holds a serious grudge.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[pointing to the leaves Hurley's been picking] You're not eating those, are you?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, these aren't for eating. Excuse me.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate gathering fruit. Jack sees her from a distance and watches her.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I can see you there, you know.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] I wasn't hiding, just didn't want to disrupt you from doing whatever it is you're doing.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's not like it's a secret.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hard to tell with you sometimes.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of seeds in Kate's hand.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Huh, gross little, grayish-yellow things.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Passion fruit seeds.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are they for?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll show you. If you want to see?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Follow me.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack and Kate walking through the jungle.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Please tell me you found a coffee bar.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Not quite.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sun at a small garden.]
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When did you do all this?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I didn't. It was all Sun. I just wandered into this place the other day when I was out picking fruit.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Sun] This is is beautiful. It's great. [Sun smiles.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She planted some herbs and some low growing stuff here. And then she started a grove over there.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Smart. With the boar running out we're going to need as much food as we can possibly get.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Maybe it's not running out.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you mean?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why would he do that?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	A lot of mouths to feed. If the boar's thinning out then why should he feed everyone else at his own expense?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of the hatch.]
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	That glass isn't breaking and the door's sealed shut. I think it's cement. What is that?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke is holding a "bowl" (coconut half), mixing something around in it.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hmmm?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	The stuff in the bowl - what is that?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke gets something out of his pack and sprinkles it into the bowl.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's for later.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	So, not to be too difficult, but we've been coming here for two days just staring at this thing. I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Ludovico Buonarrati, Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man. He had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So, Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble. Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months, stared at the marble, and gone home for his supper. So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing? And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him, and whispered, sto lavorando, I'm working. Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We're not going to stare at this for 4 months, are we? How are we going to open it?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, that's what we have to figure out. That's why we're sitting here. I mean, how do you open a hatch that has no handle, no latch, no discernible way of opening it?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Boone knocking on a door. A guy, Bryan, comes to the door.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	Yeah?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm looking for Shannon.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	Who are you?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm her brother.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bryan lets him in. Shannon walks in from another room.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What's going on?
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What are you doing here?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	15 hours. I just spent 15 hours on a plane -- happy to see you, glad you're here -- something like that might work.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Listen, this really isn't the best time. Bryan and I were just on our way out to meet some friends. Why don't you give me a call tomorrow? [She runs her hand through her hair to reveal a bruise on her forehead.] Please?
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Okay. Enjoy your friends. [Boone leaves.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Jin walking toward the shore.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[off camera at first] Jin! [Jin looks back and then just continues on his way.] Yo, Jin! Alto. Listen, I know you don't like me because of the sea urchin thing. But that's okay because I'm not asking for any favors. Just let me know where you get the fish. Fish [he makes fish-swimming motion with his hand. Jin sort of laughs.] Just point me in the right direction. I'll take care of my own business with my own tools. [Hurley makes a stabbing motion with his spear. Jin laughs.]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€šÅ“ Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«Â§Ë†Ã¬Â¶â€Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«Å¾â€˜ Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã«â€ â‚¬Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Å¡â€. ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å¸Â¬Ã«â€¹Ë†ÃªÂ¹Å’ Ã¬Â â‚¬Ã«Â¦Â¬ ÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã¬â€žÂ¸Ã¬Å¡â€. (I have no time for amateurs. Just stay out of my way.)
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You just said something mean, didn't you?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke and Boone walking in the jungle.]
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You know, we're going to have to tell them.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Tell them what?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What we found. You know, they're not going to keep believing that we're coming out here hunting. We never go back...
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They're not ready. They won't understand it.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I don't think I understand it.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's the problem.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Look, at least I've got to tell Shannon.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What do mean, why? Because she's my sister.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why do you care about her so much?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You don't know her, man. She's smart, she's special in a lot of ways.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Fair enough.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	She's been asking me about this. I can't keep lying to her.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You mean you can't keep lying to her, or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Both. Whatever. Look, she can keep a secret.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're sure?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yes, I'm sure.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, I mean, are you sure you want to do this?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I've got to get her off my back. She keeps asking me about this, she keeps asking me about you, about the whole thing.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're sure you've thought through the ramifications?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yes.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So be it.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone turns around, Locke clocks him with a knife handle.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Boone tied up. Locke is mixing the stuff in the bowl.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Locke, what is this? Do you hear me? Untie me right now.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Or what?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I swear I won't tell anyone about the hatch thing, okay? I promise.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm doing this, Boone, because it's time for you to let go of some things. Because it's what's best for you. And, I promise, you're going to thank me for this later.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Hey, I don't think this is best for me [Locke smears the stuff he's been mixing onto the wound on Boone's head.] What is that?!
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	An untreated wound, out here, is going to get infected.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You're not going to just leave me here!
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Whether you stay is up to you. The camp is 4 miles due west.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Which way is west?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke throws a knife into the ground, just out of Boone's reach.]
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You'll be able to cut yourself free once you have the proper motivation.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Locke!
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone is struggling in the ropes, trying to reach the knife.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Help, help!
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Boone at a police station.]
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	I'm sorry, Mr. Carlyle, but I'm afraid I can't help you. Unfortunately, sir, we'll need a little more to go on.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I don't understand this, I'm reporting a crime.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[questioned in the background, speaking loud] I'm sitting in this... little bar, minding my own business. And this guy...
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Look, this is a cycle with her, okay. My sister just happens to be attracted to the wrong kind of guy.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[now being dragged through the station by two policemen, shouting] I just gave it back to him. [to the detective who had questioned him] Hey, yo, croc hunter, how come nobody wants to hear my side of the story, huh?! Just what kind of...
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone turns to look at the commotion Sawyer is making. Then back to Malcolm.]
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	Now, if that were her mate, see, then I could help you. Let's finish taking down the rest of your information. You were saying she's your sister, then why is her name Rutherford, and yours Carlyle? Is she married?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	She was married. She's not married anymore, and that has nothing to do with this. [Malcolm looks up at that statement, Boone looks flustered.] Rutherford is her father's name. Our parents got married when I was 10, she was 8.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	So she's your step-sister?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	That's right.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	No blood relation.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Maybe you've heard of my mother, Sabrina Carlyle? She owns the largest wedding business in the United States. I'm the COO of the wedding clothing subsidiary.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress? Cost $2000 new. It's only been worn once.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I just want someone to go pay this guy a visit, that's all.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	Mr. Carlyle, in the absence of any physical evidence or a direct complaint from, uh...
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALCOLM	Shannon. We can't just go barging into people's apartments. Sadly, we're the police, not the dating police.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a harbor. Boone walks up to Bryan who's hosing down a picnic table on the dock area.]
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Bryan, we need to talk.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	Yeah?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm not going to waste your time, and I'm not going to waste mine. I want you to break up with my sister.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	What?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I want you to end it. Today. Right now.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	Oh, bugger off, mate.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What you don't understand, Bryan, is that you'll be the third guy I've paid to leave. Go to her house when she's not there, pack your stuff, and never have contact with her again. Understood?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	So you flew all the way over here to bribe me.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm going to give you 25,000 US dollars.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	I love her.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	How much?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	My love for her -- is worth closer to 50,000.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone writes a check.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Kate and Sun in the garden.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I can't believe we've been here for over 3 weeks. I was on my way to Bali. I travel a lot. I was looking forward to exploring the Island. Somehow I ended up on a flight to LA, instead. Guess that falls under the category -- be careful what you wish for. [Kate sees Sun smile.] You understood me. You did, didn't you, you just understood what I said? You speak English?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Please, don't tell anyone.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jin in the water with his net, and Hurley in the water with his shirt trying to catch fish. Jin gathers up his net and throws it next to the 3 other fish he's already caught. Hurley is failing to catch anything.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Damn it!
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[pointing at his fish] Ã¬ÂÂ´ÃªÂ±Â°, Ã«â€šÂ´ ÃªÂ³Â ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«â€¹Ë†ÃªÂ¹Å’ Ã«Â¨Â¹Ã¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«Â§Ë†. (Don't eat my fish!)
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know what? Fine. You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish, I'm out of here.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley throws his shirt-net away, and goes to walk off but steps on something.]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[running over to help] Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬Å Â¨ Ã¬ÂÂ¼Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬Å¡â€? (What did you do?)
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I stepped in a friggin' urchin! Ow, you understand me?! [Jin is helping Hurley from the surf.] Do you understand infection, gangrene, amputation?! [Hurley falls on top of Jin.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They stumble up on the beach.]
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ow, aw, ow! You've got to do something for me.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬ÂÂ´ÃªÂ±Â¸ Ã«Â¹Â¼Ã¬â€¢Â¼ Ã«ÂËœÃªÂ²Â Ã«â€žÂ¤. Ã¬Â´â€°Ã¬Ë†ËœÃ«Â¥Â¼ Ã«Â¹Â¼Ã¬â€¢Â¼ Ã«ÂÂ¼Ã¬Å¡â€. (Just pull out the spines -- pull them out.)
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're going to have to pee on my foot, man. It'll stop the venom. I saw it on TV. [Jin inspects Hurley's injured foot.] Ow, arrgh, no just pee on it man. [Hurley points to Jin's crotch. Jin pushes his hand away.]
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	(No -- you idiot -- that isn't going to do anything! That's for jellyfish stings!)
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You need to pee, pee on it. Pee on my foot. I'll lose my foot if you don't. Just pee! Pee on it! Pee on- [Jin is making motions, trying to communicate; then says No.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a needle being rubbed on a magnet. Sayid lays the needle across half of some kind of nut and puts it in a bowl of water. He hears rustling and jumps up holding his knife as Locke appears.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hi.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I didn't hear you.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sorry. Sneakier than I give myself credit for.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you doing out here?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We were hunting. Boone thought I should take the afternoon off.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Boone -- is hunting?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The boy's eager to learn.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You think he'll catch anything?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nope. What are you doing out here, Sayid?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Orienteering. I'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps, but...
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	There's nothing to make.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Exactly.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, you made a compass. I haven't seen one of those since I was a Webelos.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's a Webelos?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's half way between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And what does a Webelos do?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Gets badges, mostly. Ties knots, identifies birds. I wasn't the most popular kid. I'll leave you to it. [He hands Sayid the compass from his safari vest.] Maybe this will help your cause.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Don't you need this?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Not anymore.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Boone passed out. He's startled awake by Shannon's voice.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Somebody help me!
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[disoriented] Who's that?!
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone!
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[looking right] Shannon! I'm tied up!
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What?!
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[looking left] Can you get over here?!
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I'm tied up, too!
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear monster sounds.]
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[screaming] Boone!
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Hold on Shannon, I'm coming!
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone! It's getting closer! Somebody help me! Boone!
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone struggles to try and reach the knife, almost reaching it.]
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Please, help!
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone struggles more and reaches it. We hear monster sounds.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone!
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone quickly cuts through the ropes and starts running. He comes across Shannon who is tied to a tree, and runs up to free her.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone, help me! Hurry, please!
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm trying.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Please hurry.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone frees her and they start running.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Go. Come on. [They come to a close stand of trees.] In here, in here.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They go in to hide. We see the shadow of the monster outside. We hear the sound of birds flying away. Then the sound of crashing, like the monster is trying to get in.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid and Jack walking in the jungle.]
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Let me ask you something -- which way do you think North is?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	North? Which way is it?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh, okay. [He looks around and points.] The sun's going to set over there, so that makes that West. [He points in another direction.] That'd be North. Yeah.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Correct. That's where North should be. [He pulls Locke's compass out and shows Jack that North doesn't show up correctly on the compass.] Yet that is North.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not...
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A minor magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of 2 or 3 degrees, but not this.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you saying?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm saying this compass is obviously defective.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] Where'd you get it?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Locke gave it to me this afternoon.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke? Where'd you see Locke?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	About a mile East of here, walking through the jungle. At least I think it's East.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a stand of trees where Boone and Shannon are hiding. Boone and Shannon terrified inside. Boone looks out, and then they start to leave.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What did you do to him?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What did I do to who?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Locke. What did you do to that psycho to piss him off?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I didn't do anything to him.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What? He just did it because he was bored? Look, I know you guys are...
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Let's go back to camp.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sound of knocking on a door. We see Boone back at Shannon's house.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You were supposed to come later.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Do you have any bags? Anything you want to take?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You should go back.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No, Shannon. We're getting out of this country. Is there anything you want to bring with you? What's the matter with you?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bryan walks in the front door.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	Aw, look at this.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[to Shannon] Let's go, please. C'mon. We can go.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	Hey, mate, you don't get this yet, do you -- what's what?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You set me up. This whole thing was a set up.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	She's just getting what she's owed.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What'd you say?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	She told me your mum screwed Shannon over after her daddy died, kept all her father's money for herself. A sweet mum you got there.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[to Shannon] This isn't the first time, is it? Oh, you've done this before, you little bitch.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRYAN	That's enough.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Don't touch me you low life piece of-
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bryan punches Boone, knocks him down, and keeps punching.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Bryan, get off of him! Get off of him! Get off!!
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone struggles to get up and leaves.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back at the beach we see Locke looking out toward sea. Jack approaches.]
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Any ships?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Not yet. But I'm -- patient.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Mind if I join you? It's been awhile since you and I talked, John.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, you're a busy man.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So are you. Where's Boone?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I haven't seen him today.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah? You two have been attached at the hip all week.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, let me just check my hip... Nope, no Boone.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How's the boar hunting going?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Between you and me?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Always.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley. They're smart animals, and smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator is introduced into their environment.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You mean us?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The most dangerous predator of all.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate and Sun walking.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Does anybody else know?
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Only Michael.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	But not your husband?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Please, I...
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't worry. I can keep a secret.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I took English lessons in Korea. He doesn't know -- it's complicated.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So why don't you tell him now?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I can't.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Because I love him.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't...
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Have you never lied to a man you've loved?
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jin trying to open some kind of shellfish, as Hurley looks on.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You sure you don't speak English? Cuz there's a rumor that you do. -- Your wife's hot.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin gives Hurley the thing he was opening to eat.]
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, I get it, this is some kind of payback because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time? I eat this you give me a fish, right? Okay, fine. Over the lips and past the gums, yada yada, oh god.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley swallows it and promptly pukes.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack giving aspirin to Charlie on the beach.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[swallowing it] Cheers.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You need a hand?
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, yeah, I'd love one.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack helps Charlie with some firewood.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Haven't seen you around the caves lately.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I needed a change of scenery.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How are you doing, Charlie?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	How am I doing? With week 2 of heroin withdrawal? Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I gave you the aspirin for the heroin withdrawal. [Jack nods toward Locke.] What do you think his story is?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Who? Locke? The guy's a freak of nature. Highly disturbed. Chances are he probably killed all his mates at the post office the day his mum forgot to put a cookie in his lunch tin. That was my first impression, anyway. And then he saved my life.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So you trust him?
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Trust him? No offense, mate, but if there's one person on this Island I would put my absolute faith in to save us all it would be John Locke.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack looking at Locke who is sitting staring out to sea.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael finding a box in a backpack and opening it. Looking sad. Vincent and Walt run up.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	C'mon, you want the ball? Go get the ball. Go get the ball. Good boy.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael smiling fondly at Walt.]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[off camera at first] Dude, did you find your own bag? That's awesome, man.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Come on, Vincent, over here.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Got some papaya there, huh?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah. Yippee.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[pointing at the papaya and the knife Hurley has taken out] Hey, you mind if I, uh...?
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[handing over the papaya and knife] Knock yourself out. You want to wish something on your worst enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin. [Jin walks up and holds out a fish to Hurley.] Oh hey, thanks. Dude, has this thing already been cleaned? Are you kidding me?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«Â°Â¥ Ã«Â¨Â¹Ã¬â€”Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Å¡â€?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«â€¹Ë†, Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Â§Â Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã«Â¨Â¹Ã¬â€”Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´. Ã¬â€ Â Ã¬â€Â»Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬â€¢Â¼ ÃªÂ²Â Ã¬â€“Â´. Ã¬â€ ÂÃ¬ÂÂ´ Ã«Ââ€Ã«Å¸Â¬Ã¬â€ºÅ’Ã¬Â¡Å’Ã¬â€“Â´.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin and Sun walk past the waterfall where Kate is washing up, watching them.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[entering] They look happy.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Happy?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Put out your hand. [Kate looks skeptical.] You'll like it, I swear.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack puts something in her hand.]
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Gross little grayish-yellow thingies?
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, no, no, no, these are slimy little bluish-black thingies.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Guava seeds.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's a garden without guava?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Boone and Shannon in the jungle.]
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Are you sure we're going in the right direction?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	If you don't want to follow me, don't.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I wouldn't have to follow you if you weren't best friends with the nut case who brought us out here. You and Locke weren't hunting, were you? You were doing something else.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Haven't we been over this before?
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You're a horrible liar, Boone.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We weren't doing anything.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Why are you keeping secrets for this guy?
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Do you know who this guy is? He's the only one here that has a clue to what's going on.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What is that supposed to mean?
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It means he's smart.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	He tied us up, Boone. Why?
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We found something.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	While we were out looking for Claire we found this -- this piece of metal buried in the jungle. We've been excavating it. That's what we've been doing.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	A piece of metal?
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	A hatch, buried in the dirt.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Like a door?
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yes, Shannon, that's what a hatch is.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Where does it go?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear weird bird sounds.]
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I don't know. But I told him I wanted to tell you, and that's when he did this.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear the sound of the Monster. A couple of trees are ripped straight up out of the ground. Boone and Shannon run.]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	C'mon.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear monster sounds; stomping sounds. Shannon is picked up off the ground as she's running.]
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No, Shannon!
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Boone running around looking for Shannon.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon! Shannon!
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Boone in a hotel room holding a bag of ice on his face where Bryan slugged him. There's a knock on the door. Shannon is there taking her shoes off.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What do you want?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Bryan took the money. He's gone.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	So the player got played. It's poetic, don't you think?
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I knew you'd bring the money. I knew you would.
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You're drunk.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You want to know why?
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I guess it doesn't matter, does it? Because you're going to tell me anyway.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Because you're in love with me.
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What?
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You brought the money because you're in love with me.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You show up here plastered...
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You've always been in love with me.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You've always been a self-centered little bitch, but now you're delusional.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I've always known it.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You're sick.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[going in to kiss him] No.
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Stop.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	It's okay.
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They start making out and end up on the bed.]
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Scene cuts to dark with Boone in the foreground with his shirt off.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone?
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What?
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	When we get back to LA [she switches on the light; she's sitting on a chair fully clothed] you should just tell your mom that you rescued me -- again, just like you always do. And then we'll just go back.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	To what?
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	To what it was.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Like it's all up to you.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Get dressed.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Boone in the jungle.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon!
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He sees blood and follows the trail. He sees Shannon laying on some rocks and runs over.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No... [holding Shannon's body] Shannon? Shannon? Shan?
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Night-time. Boone is coming up to camp and sees Locke sitting by a fire. He runs up with a knife drawn.]
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[attacking Locke] It killed her!
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You made it back.
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	That thing killed my sister. It's your fault. You drug her out there.
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Your sister?
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Don't play dumb with me.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Calm down.
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	She died in my arms.
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why is there no blood on you?
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone looks at himself and sees there's no blood.]
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What the hell just happened to me out there?
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't know. I don't know, you tell me. [Locke pushes Boone off of him.] But your sister, Shannon... [we can see Shannon walk up with Sayid in the background]
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	She was dead.
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is that what it made you see?
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What made me see? That stuff you put on my head -- you drugged me.
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I gave you an experience that I believe was vital to your survival on this Island.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It wasn't real?
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It was only as real as you made it.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I saw her -- I saw her die.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How did you feel? When she died?
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I felt -- I felt -- I felt relieved. I felt relieved.
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes. Time to let go. [Locke gets up and grabs his pack.] Follow me.
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone follows.]
