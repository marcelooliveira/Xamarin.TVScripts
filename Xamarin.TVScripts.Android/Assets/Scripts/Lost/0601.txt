LA X, Parts 1 & 2
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The Previously on Lost ends with the detonation of the bomb - then cuts to the clouds, as the view zooms out to Jack. Jack is then interrupted by Cindy.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	So how's the drink?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh... it's good.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	That's not a very strong reaction.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, it's--it's not a very strong drink.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She hands Jack a single Vodka bottle.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Don't tell anyone.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It'll be our secret.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Jack pours the Vodka into his drink, the plane shakes causing him to spill a little. Jack buckles his seatbelt.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[Over P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rattling stops.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[Over P.A.] Please return to your seats and keep your seat belts fastened.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	It's normal. My husband said the planes want to stay in the air.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack chuckles.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sounds like a smart man.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry--
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane starts to shake again, this time more violently. Luggage falls from the overhead compartment and Jack grips his seat, almost in anticipation. The turbulance ends and Jack breaths a sigh of relief.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You can let go now.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Passengers murmuring.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	It's okay. You--you can let go.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack let's go and sighs.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Looks like we made it.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Yeah. We sure did.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bell dings.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NORRIS	[over P.A.] Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks. We just hit a pocket of rough air. It should be a smooth ride from here on out.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard returns from the bathroom.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[Lowered voice] Remind me to hold it next time, will ya? [Normal voice] I almost died in that bathroom.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Seat belt clicks.]
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Now I know how the laundry feels when it's in the dryer.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose chuckles.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I missed you.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I missed you, too, beautiful.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack visits restroom, and see's what appears to be shaving wound on neck. He then goes back to his seat to find Desmond sitting in the row.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat? The stewardess said it was empty.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. No, I'm at the window.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh, right. [Unlatches seat belt] Listen, mate, do you mind if I sit here? It's just the fella next to me has been snoring ever since we took off from Sydney.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] Yeah, no problem.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Thanks, brother. [Jack, unnerved, looks at Desmond] Something wrong?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. No, you just... [sighs] Do I know you from somewhere?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Chuckles] Well, I'm not sure. [holding out his hand] Desmond.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[shaking Desmond's hand] Jack.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Nice to meet you, Jack... or to see you again.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack laughs, then sighs. The camera pans out the window and shoots down, miles beneath the plane into the ocean, where the entire Island lies sunken under the ocean. The sonic fence and DI houses are shown, as is DHARMA shark and the 4-toed statue.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back in 1977, Jack holds the Jughead core over the Swan shaft. The Incident begins, resulting in Juliet being pulled down the shaft by some chains.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Aah! No! No!
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet!
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Aah!
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I got you. No, don't let go!
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Aah!
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet! No!
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She falls. Down in the shaft, Juliet hits the core.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Sobbing] Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Loud explosion - white flash. Focus on Kate's eye - she regains consciousness to find she's up a tree - all sound is muffled. She nearly falls and manages to hang on.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Grunting] Aah!
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She climbs down the tree and reaches the ground. Muffled ringing noise continues.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hello?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[This causes some discomfort and Kate rubs her ears. The ringing gets quieter.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hello?!
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate starts to look around.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Hey!
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Grunts - Kate tackles Miles to the ground.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	[Grunts] Hey! Hey! Kate!
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Panting.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	It's okay. It's me, miles. It's okay.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	What?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where are we?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	I can't--I can't hear you. Are your ears ringing?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate notices the doors to the Swan station hidden in the vines and examines it.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	What is it?
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We're back.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Back where?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate runs to see hatch crater.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Is that the construction site?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No. That's the Swan hatch... after Desmond blew it up.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Guess we're not in 1977, huh?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate notices Jack and Sawyer on the floor - she goes to Jack.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack? Jack. [he wakes up] Can you hear me? Jack!
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What happened? Where are we?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	At the hatch.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets up and looks into the crater.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What? They built it?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. They built it.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Grunts - Sawyer kicks Jack in the face, who falls down into crater.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer!
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate climbs down after Jack.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uhh!
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You were wrong! [Sawyer begins to climb down] That's the damn Swan hatch--blown up just like we left it before we started jumping through time! You said we could stop it from ever gettin' built! That our plane would never crash on this Island!
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Stop it!
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	This ain't LAX!
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Stop it!
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You blew us right back where we started! Except Juliet's dead. She's dead, you son of a bitch, 'cause you were wrong.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Panting] Sawyer... I'm sorry. I thought we were supposed to... I thought it would work.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, it didn't!
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack walks to restroom.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You in line?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARS	No, I'm just waiting for my friend.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Door unlocks and rattles. Kate bursts out and bumps into Jack.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Oh!
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Whoa.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sorry. I didn't...
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] It's okay.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I didn't see you there.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's okay.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARS	Let's get back to our seats, sweetheart.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They take their seats. Mars passes Kate a meal tray.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARS	Mmm. Lasagna.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mars snatches the metal cutlery from the tray.]
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARS	No. No knife and fork for you, honey.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you think I'm gonna do, stab you and run?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A man brushes past Mars on his way through the aisle.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARS	Hey, watch we're you're going, buddy.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Turning around] Sorry. My bad.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer continues down the aisle to his seat.]
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Say it. Come on, please? Just once.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I really don't want to, dude.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	I love those commercials. Come on. Just do the Australian accent, and I'll leave you alone.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	All right. Fine. All right. [Australian accent] Oi! Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	[Laughing] You know who this is? This is--this is the owner of Mr. Cluck's Chicken. And he's--and he's back here riding coach with the rest of us yutzes! Huh? [Laughs]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How about that?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Hey, um, do you mind me asking, how exactly did a guy like you get to own a major corporation?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I won the lottery and I like chicken, so I bought it.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Oh. Good. Good for you.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Arzt leaves.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah? Why not?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Cause they'll take advantage of you. That's why not.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's not, huh?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me. I'm the luckiest guy alive.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley puts his headphones on and smiles.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley sits outside the DHARMA van with Sayid's head resting on him.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Loudly] What just happened?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I found a flashlight.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, who cares? The sky just went from day to night. What happened?!
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I think we moved through time.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How do you know that?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	White flash. Headache. Can't hear. Happened to me before.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What about Jack and everyone else? Did they move through time, too?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I don't know. They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer shouts indistinctly.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	And then I heard gunfire--
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Shh!
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Shouting distantly] You said that our plane would never crash on this Island!
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You hear that, dude? It's Sawyer.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Stay here with Sayid.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin takes off. At the crater, Jack and Sawyer argue.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The bomb must've gone off.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?!
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Jack! Sayid needs help.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is he?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	With Hurley at the van. Two minutes away.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Muffled, weak voice] Help.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	He's still bleeding. We don't know what to do.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Help me.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate hears Juliet under the twisted metal of the Swan station and investigates.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So what do you say, doc? Got another great idea to save Sayid? Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, shut up!
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Help.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer starts to clear the metal out of the way, and everyone else joins him.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet!
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	James?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Oh, my God.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet!
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the van, Sayid coughs and gags.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, God. Oh, God, this is gross.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Coughing and gagging, wheezing.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Don't worry, dude. Everything's gonna be fine.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Weakly] When I die... [groans] what do you think will happen to me?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Just--just try not to talk, dude.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Inhales sharply] I've tortured more people than I can remember. I murdered. Wherever I'm going... [whispers] it can't be very pleasant.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sayid, come on.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I deserve it.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley hears leaves rustling in the jungle.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hello? Jin?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid wheezes.]
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jin!
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Leaves rustle. Hurley picks up a gun.]
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I've got a gun!
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The rustling stops. Hurley struggles feebly to cock the gun.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And I know how to shoot it!
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He goes to investigate. The rustling starts again. Hurley hears footsteps behind him and turns around slowly. Jacob in standing there.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Hello, Hugo. You got a minute?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Rose and Bernard Speak indistinctly... both chuckle. Sun smiles as she watches them from her seat.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã«Å¾Å’Ã«â€œÂ¤Ã¬Ââ€ž Ã«Â­Ëœ Ã¬Â³ÂÃ«â€¹Â¤Ã«Â´Â? [Subtitle: Why are you staring at them?]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«â€¹Ë†... ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Æ’Â¥ Ã«â€žË†Ã«Â¬Â´ Ã­â€“â€°Ã«Â³ÂµÃ­â€¢Â´Ã«Â³Â´Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã¬â€žÅ“Ã¬Å¡â€. [Subtitles: I-- they just seem so happy.]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€¹Â¨Ã¬Â¶â€ Ã¬Â±â€žÃ¬â€ºÅ’Ã«ÂÂ¼. [Subtitles: Button your sweater.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She does. Locke is looking at a leaftlet about emergency procedures.]
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You're wasting your time, man. This plane goes down in the ocean way out here, I think our chances of survival are exactly zero.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot, we could survive a water landing. And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough to keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts...
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone grins at Locke.]
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No, it's just impressive you know that. So what were you doing in Australia? Business or pleasure?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Pleasure. You?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship that it turns out she didn't want to get out of. So... here I am. So what, you were just Down Under for vacation?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Actually, I went on a walkabout.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Really? Like--like Crocodile Dundee?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Chuckles] No, not exactly. But--but, uh, it was pretty intense. We--we spent ten days in the Outback and, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives. We slept under the stars and made our own fires, hunted our own food.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Wow. I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both chuckle.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You're not pulling my leg, are ya?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why would I pull your leg?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone chuckles.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke gives thumbs up.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Inside Jacob's chamber the fire crackles. Locke cuts material from a rug and wipes Jacobs blood from the blade. Ben stands over the fire, staring into it motionless.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You can stop staring at the fire. Jacob's gone. He's gone.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Why didn't he fight back? Why did he let me just kill him?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I guess he knew that he was beaten. Ben... I want you to go outside and tell Richard that I need to talk to him.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Talk to him about... what?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's between me and Richard.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, indistinct heated conversation takes place between Richard and Bram.]
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	There's no other reason.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRAM	No, that's not how it's gonna be.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	You have to--you're not going in there.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Speaks indistinctly.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	No [...indistinct]
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Speaks indistinctly.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Just back up a little. Okay?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard and Bram speaking indistinctly.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Who are they?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Other than the fact that I know they were on the Ajira flight with us, all I know is they knocked me out and dragged my ass to some cabin, which they promptly burned, then... brought me here along with the dead guy in the box. They say they're the good guys.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both speaking indistinctly.]
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	I'm not buying it either.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram starts to walk toward the statue and Richard stops him.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully. No one goes in there unless Jacob invites them in.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Richard, that's why we're here, because Jacob invited us.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue doesn't mean you're in charge.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Then who is?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben steps down the rocks onto the beach.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Richard. [Panting]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Ben. What happened in there?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Everything's fine. John wants to speak to you.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Is Jacob all right?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm sorry. Who are you?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Answer her question, Ben.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, of course Jacob's all right. They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	John wants to talk to me?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's right.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard grabs Ben and pulls him along the beach.]
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Richard, what are you doing? I don't understand.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Well, I'm happy to talk to John. But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard throws Ben down on the sand next to where the body of John Locke lays half-dumped out of the cargo container.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Kate, Jack, Miles, and Jin dig through the wreckage at the Swan crater. Clanking metal, grunting.]
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hang on, Juliet! We're comin'!
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Clanking metal, grunting.]
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jin! Flashlight!
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin hands Jack the flashlight, Jack shines the light into the hole.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If we can move this beam, I think I can get down there.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Clanking metal, grunting.]
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's too heavy... we need something to pull it. Jin! The van. There's chains in it. Go get 'em!
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin runs into the jungle.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, Hurley follows Jacob back to Sayid and the van.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Where you goin', dude? And what are you doin' here? I mean... I meet you in a taxi and you know everything about me and you give me a plane ticket which just so happens to get me back on this Island. How'd you know that was gonna happen?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob looks down at Sayid, does not respond.]
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hello? Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob kneels next to Sayid, troubled.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, my friend Jin is gonna be here any second so you better stop ignoring--
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why not?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Because I died an hour ago.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry, dude, that sucks.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob stands.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Thanks.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How'd you die?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	I was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley thinks for a moment.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You want me to do something crazy again, don't you?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well that's why Jin went to go get Jack...
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Jin can't help him. You need to take Sayid to the Temple. That's the only chance he's got. And the rest of them will be safe there.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The Temple? I'm supposed to know what that is?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Jin knows. Tell him to take you to the hole in the wall where he was with the French team. Through that opening you can get into the Temple. You still have that guitar case I gave you?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah...
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Bring it.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Who are you, dude?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	I'm Jacob.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley's eyes widen... in recognition? Rustling. Jin runs out of the jungle.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Hurley! Help me with Sayid. We have to get him into the van. Juliet needs our help.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley turns to find that Jacob has disappeared.]
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Come on, we have to go!
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jin lift Sayid into the van. Moments later, the van rumbles through the jungle.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jin, if I asked you to take me to where there's, like, a hole in the wall... where you went with the French team... would you know what I was talkin' about?
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin thinks for a moment.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Yes.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Good.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Swan crater, the group hears the van approaching. Engine rumbling, tires squeaking.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll get the chain.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles drops his shovel and follows Jack to the van.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet!
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He begins tugging at the beam, Katie wrestles him off.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Stop it! Stop, Sawyer! The van is here, the chains are coming.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Chains rattling.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She ain't makin' any more noises...
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, she knows we're here. She's probably just resting.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet!
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin tosses one end of the chain into the crater, Jack picks it up. Sawyer looks at Jack.]
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If she dies, I'll kill him.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Chain rattling.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack sits in his seat on the plane.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[Over P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to be alarmed about, but if there is a doctor onboard could you please press your call button?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Electronic ding. Cindy approaches Jack's seat and responds to the call.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Sir? You're a doctor?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Could you come with me please?
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack follows Cindy down the aisle.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	We appreciate your help. A passenger went into the restroom about half an hour ago and he's not responding when we knock.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another airline employee is knocking on the restroom door.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	This man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in there--"
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMPLOYEE	Well, I think he tampered with the lock, it's... it's jammed or something, I don't know.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Can I be of assistance?
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all stare at him.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Excuse me.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid kicks the restroom door open. Jack checks the pulse of a man wearing a familiar ring and listens for breathing.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's not breathing.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man is revealed to be Charlie.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cindy rushes to back of plane with medical supplies.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's goin' on back there, Earheart?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Everything's fine sir, please just stay in your seats.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	...yeah, looks peachy.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Sayid] ...Sir, I'm gonna need your help.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What can I do?
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I need ya [Jack pulls out breathing pump] to hold this over his mouth... hold it there and do not let any air escape.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	OK, now?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes, now.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pumps air.]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Somethings blocking his air passage. [Jacks sticks fingers in Charlies mouth] I'm gonna have to open it up. I need, uh, something sharp - a razor...
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cindy frantically looks.]
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I gotta pen.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A pen!?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	It's regulation, there's nothing sharp.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	A pen! Just a pen. I had a pen in my jacket but it's gone. Damnit.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack tries again - he gets the obstruction (heroin) out, passes it to Sayid. Charlie wakes up, gasping for air.]
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I got it, I got it. Relax, just relax, breathe.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Am I alive?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, you're alive.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[sighs] ...Terrific.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sawyer and Kate wrap the chain around the girder.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You got it?
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay Jin! We're good down here! [Jin starts DHARMA van] ...hit it!
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[All struggle to get girder out - successfully.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Gimme the flashlight.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer climbs down to Juliet.]
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet! Okay...I'm comin... Juliet? Hey, I'm here, come on baby, come on wake up.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet opens eyes.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Hi.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Wh-Wh-Where are we?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't worry about that. You're fine. I gotta get you outta here, okay?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It didn't work, we're still on the Island.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's okay, It's okay, I just gotta get this loose enough to get you out, okay?
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No, I hit the bomb and you're still here.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You what? ...You hit the bomb? Why?
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I wanted you to be able to go home. I wanted to make it so you never came to this damn Island [Juliet starts crying] ...it didn't work.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't you worry about that. You're gonna be OK. I'm gonna get you outta here and we're all gonna go home together, you hear me?
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outisde in the crater, Kate is looking down into the hole.]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer!?
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is inspecting Sayids wound in the van.]
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Even if I could get the bullet out, bleeding won't stop, there's nothing I can do for him.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	There's somethin' I can do. There's a temple, if we can get Sayid there we can save him.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	And you know this how?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This guy Jacob told me just before we got here.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who's Jacob?
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Does it matter? Can you fix Sayid, Jack?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Then you're gonna have to let me do it.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack nods.]
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, Ben stares at the body of Locke.]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Ben, you need to talk to me. I can't stop them unless you tell me what happened in there. What happened to Jacob.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben is silent.]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	You and I have known each other for 30 years Ben, I'm asking you this as a friend.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You wanna know what happened Richard? Why don't 'cha go inside and find out.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram grabs Ben roughly and pulls him along the beach.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	What are ya doin?
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRAM	We're goin in, and he's comin' with us.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram and three others go with him, Locke is waiting patiently inside. Ben gets pushed inside.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Where's Richard?
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He's not coming.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then who is that behind you?
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram and three others walk in, rifles aimed and ready, almost ignoring Locke and looking around.]
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRAM	Where's Jacob?
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jacob is dead.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram and others cock rifles and point at Locke.]
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRAM	Who are you?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Don't worry about me. Let's talk about you. I'm assuming that you are, what? Jacobs bodyguards? And that you came all the way to this Island to protect him? Well I have good news, Jacob burned up, right there in that fire. Therefore there's nothing left for you to protect. You can go. You're free.
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram shoots Locke in upper right section of body. Locke recoils from impact... multiple other shots from Bram and buddies are fired while Locke runs behind a stone pillar.]
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRAM	Kill him! Spread out! Get him! ...where is he?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bram picks up bullet damaged by impact, with no blood on it. Smokey sounds surround them, then smokey appears in entrance, Ben crouches in corner, scared. Smokey kills Brams three buddies, but Bram pours ash in a circle on floor and stands in it - it seems to stop smokey. Smokey hits the roof, knocking bits off which knock Bram out of circle, at which point smokey kills him too. Ben starts to walks out, but hears footsteps behind him. He turns around. Locke is standing there.]
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sorry you had to see me like that.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate is still looking into the hole.]
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer!? Is she ok?
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Working on it!
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer struggles to lift iron girder off Juliet's legs.]
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, okay, I got'cha, I got'cha. Don't worry.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer hugs Juliet.]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We can get coffee some time.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I gotta get you outta here.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We can go dutch.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet...it's me.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	...James.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kiss me.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got it Blondie.
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss.]
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I have to tell you something, it's really really important.
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You tell me... you tell me...
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet starts to mouth words, but she passes away.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet? You tell me [Sawyer begins crying] ...oh...oh my god [groans, crying]
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Miles, Hurley, and Kate watch as Sawyer brings Juliet's body to surface, Sawyer gives Jack the evil eye.]
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You did this.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Charlie is bound by two male flight attendants, then taken to his seat, passing Jack.]
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Should'a let that happen man, I was supposed to die.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Don't take it personally, some people just don't know how to say thanks.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack goes back to his seat, noticing Desmond is no longer there.]
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me, do you know what happened to the guy that was sitting next to me?
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Um, we were asleep.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NORRIS	[on P.A.] Ladies and Gentlemen, captain Norris here, we're now beginning our final descent into Los Angeles international airport, I'm happy to tell you it's a beautiful day in Los Angeles, 72 degrees, 6 miles visibility and winds outta the south-west at 5 miles an hour.
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Buckle up. We're almost home.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack smiles and buckles up.]
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NORRIS	I'll be putting on the fasten seat belt sign now, we'll be on the ground in just a few minutes, thank you so much for flying Oceanic Air.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Hurley raise seats to upright position; Jin looks at Rolex watch and out window. The plane lands - cops take Charlie away first - all get up to leave - Sayid leaves quickly - Boone shakes Lockes hand - Jack leaves last, seeing Locke get put into a wheelchair.]
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack and Jin get Sayid out of the DHARMA van - Juliet's body is covered, next to the van - Hurley takes the guitar case out of van.]
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Are we gonna sing Kum Ba Yah on the way?
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not a guitar man.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Then what is it?
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Saywer] ...you going with them?
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No, I'm gonna bury her.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Let me help you.
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Help Sayid.
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer takes some shovels out of the van.]
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey Miles, you mind hangin' back?
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	You got it boss.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll make sure to leave a trail so you can follow us.
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't followin' nobody Kate.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Jack] You guys ready?
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Whenever you are.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer picks up Juliets body with a last glance at Jack before going. Jack and Jin pick up Sayid and start on their way.]
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideway - Jack is waiting in line to pass through customs.]
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OCEANIC-MALE	[LAX overhead PA announcement] Oceanic passenger Jack Shephard, Jack Shephard, please go to the nearest courtesy desk.
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack goes to the Oceanic desk.]
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hi, uh, I'm Jack Shephard, I was just paged?
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OCEANIC-MALE	Oh, Mr. Shephard, hello, yes - that was me, uh, sorry I meant to meet you at the gate.
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'm here now. So...
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OCEANIC-MALE	Mr. Shephard, I'm deeply sorry but there seems to have been a mix up involving the, uh, cargo you checked in Sydney.
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Cargo?
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OCEANIC-MALE	Yes sir, a coffin?
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't... [sighs] ...I don't understand, I mean are you saying that it's not here?
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OCEANIC-MALE	It appears it was never put on the plane.
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[visibly upset] The funeral is in two hours - when is it getting here?
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OCEANIC-MALE	Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you how deeply sorry we are but we don't know when it will arrive, because we're not exactly sure where it is.
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack, Jin, Sayid, Kate, Hurely approach the wall surrounding temple.]
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's a big wall.
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How're we gonna get him over the top?
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley walks up to hole in wall, looking down.]
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We're not, we're bringing him in through here.
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all go down. Hurley finds Montand's skeleton. Kate finds a bag and empties it, Hurley sees a book.]
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Who brings a book into a cave?
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate finds matches and a torch, which is next to skeleton with missing arm.]
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And why is his arm missing?
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate lights torch.]
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	It was ripped off when he was attacked by the black smoke.
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, this is gonna be awesome.
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They start to make their way through the jungle. All walk up to the hole where Ben fell down.]
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Watch your step.
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks around the hole.]
948	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	OK.
950	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley follows, then the rest. Kate walks on ahead, then she hears whispers - Jack notices she's missing.]
952	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Kate?
954	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	She was right over there.
956	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate! ... KATE! Can you hear me? Kate! [Jack walks further away]
958	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack! [indistinct] we can't [indistinct chatter interrupted by a punch] ...Hey, let him... [indistinct]
960	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley! ... Jin! ... Hurley!
962	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hears whispers - he gets attacked and knocked out.]
964	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Regaining consciousness, he is dragged into clearing in jungle.]
966	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You okay?
968	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, you?
970	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
972	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They are led to a temple by guards with guns.]
974	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Guess we found the temple.
976	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Kate and the Marshal are at customs.]

What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand". Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when John first came to the Island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave.

1518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, how could they know.
1520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They're the one's that checked him in, I mean they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.
1522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No I'm not talking about the coffin, I mean how could they know where he is. They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body.
1524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, seeming to understand Locke, nods - Lock smiles.]
1526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Either way, your story beats the hell outta mine - all that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives. [Oceanic staff gives Locke a receipt] Thanks.
1528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Some kinda salesman?
1530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, something like that. Well it was nice talking to ya, hope ya find that coffin.
1532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hope you find your knives.
1534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, thanks.
1536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke begins to wheel himself out.]
1538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Mind if I ask what happened to ya? [Locke is silent] I'm sorry, I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon, I didn't mean to...
1540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, no, don't worry about it - uh, uh surgery isn't gonna do anything to help me, my condition is irreversible.
1542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nothing is irreversible. Umm, if you ever wanna consult, just uh, gimme a call. [Jack hands Locke his business card] - It's on the house.
1544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well thanks [takes card - reads name] - Jack Shephard, I'm John - John Locke.
1546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's nice to meet ya John.
1548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nice to meet you too.
1550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack opens door for Locke.]
1552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Thanks.
1554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're welcome.
1556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Flare fired from temple is visible in sky - Richard sitting on the beach notices it.]
1558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	What the hell is that?
1560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard looks scared. Rifles are cocked and pointed at Locke as people see him and Ben walking toward them.]
1562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
1564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	I'm seein' it - But I'm still not believin' it.
1566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke walks up to Richard.]
1568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello Richard. It's good to see you outta those chains.
1570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	[eyes widen] ... you?
1572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Me.
1574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke immediately hits Richard in the throat, then knocks him unconscious.]
1576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I am very disappointed ... in all of you.
1578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke puts Richard on his shoulder, and walks right past the corpse of Locke in the Ajira cargo box.]
1580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Temple, Lennon and a couple others walk up to Jack, still looking at Sayid's corpse.]
1582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LENNON	You Shephard?
1584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
1586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LENNON	We need to speak to you privately.
1588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If you've got something to say to me then say it, otherwise just leave me alone.
1590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LENNON	I don't think you're understanding me here, I'm asking politely, you either get up and come with us on your own, or I'll have ya dragged out. Because we are going to have this conversation and it's not going to be here.
1592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets up and confrontation-ally approaches Lennon.]
1594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is that right.
1596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and others start to wrestle - Hurley and Lennon are both distracted by something else.]
1598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack!
1600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[All turn around to see Sayid slowly stirring to life.]
1602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LENNON	Oh my god.
1604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wha...
1606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What happened?
