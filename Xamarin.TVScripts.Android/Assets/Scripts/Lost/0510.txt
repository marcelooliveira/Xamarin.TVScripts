6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Chickens clucking.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Title card: Tikrit, Iraq]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A man drags a boy outside.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[Pulling a boy alongside him.] [Subtitle: Come on! You are not a child anymore. Act like a man. You must kill one.] [Gestures toward a chicken coop.]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOY	[Glances sadly at the chickens. Hesitantly:] [Subtitle: I...I don't want to.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[Sternly] [Subtitle: You will do as your father asks.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOY	[Subtitle: No!]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[Subtitle: Listen to what I'm telling you! Come on, kill one of them! You will stay outside until you do!]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man leaves the boy standing in front of the chicken coop with knife in hand. A smaller boy approaches from behind, lays a hand on the larger boy's shoulder. They look at each other. The smaller boy opens his hand to reveal a handful of chicken feed. The smaller boy enters the coop and lays the feed on the ground in front of him. A bird approaches, which the boy lifts into his arms. The boy snaps the bird's neck while the other boy looks on wincing. The smaller boy brings the bird out of the coop and offers it to the larger boy, who takes it. The man approaches the pair again.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[To the larger boy] [Subtitle: Good for you. You did it.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOY	[Subtitle: It wasn't me.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[Subtitle: Well, at least one of you will be a man.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He approaches and bends down to look the smaller boy in the eyes.]
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[Subtitle: Well done, Sayid.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sayid is locked in the DHARMA cell. Young Ben enters the nearby surveillance room, where Phil sits watching the monitors.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Hey Phil.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	Hey.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	I brought another sandwich for him. Chicken salad this time.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	Yeah, I don't think it's the menu. He's not eating. Save yourself the trouble kid.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	But Horace told me to.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	Why does he care so much? That guy's a hostile.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	Whatever.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Young Ben enters the room where Sayid is imprisoned.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Brought you a sandwich. And a book. I read it twice. It's good.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Takes the food and book.] Thank you.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Did Richard send you? [Sayid turns to look at young Ben.] Richard. He's your leader, right? [Sayid looks up towards the surveillance camera and makes a small nod in its direction.] It's just a camera. They can see, but they can't hear. Four years ago I ran away into the jungle and Richard found me. I said I wanted to leave. That I wanted to join you. So I've been patient. And if you're patient too, I think I can help you.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Title Card: Moscow]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - A man rushes in through a doorway, frantically dropping his bags and shutting the door behind him. He scrambles along hallway into a room, whose door he deadbolts upon entering. He briefly stops to listen at the door. When he hears banging noises coming from outside the room, he rushes to a large wooden cabinet and begins emptying it of its contents. A safe is revealed inside. The banging noises continue as the man enters the combination and opens the safe. Suddenly, the room's door bursts open and Sayid appears, holding a gun, which he points at the man.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN 2	[Frantically speaking Russian to Sayid] ÃÅ¸ÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¶ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸! ÃÅ¸ÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¶ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸!

Three or four hundred thousand euros. It's all yours [holding out a large wad of cash in Sayid's direction]. Please, pleasÃÂµ. [Sayid shoots him.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[NIGHT: Sayid walks down the street toward a gated lot, which he enters. A man in a black coat and hat stands beside an old car. The man turns around and is revealed to be Ben.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	How'd it go?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He tried to bribe me. It didn't work.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Of course it didn't.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Where to now?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Contemplates.] Nowhere. You're done.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Incredulous] What do you mean I'm done?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We're done. Andropov was the last one. You've taken care of everyone who posed a threat to your friends. [Smiling] It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid. [Ben starts to leave.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Indignant] So that's it? I killed all those people for you, and now you're just walking away?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You didn't kill them for me, Sayid. You're the one that asked for their names. There's no one else in Widmore's organization that we need to go after. Congratulations! Mission accomplished! [Starts to leave again.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Quietly] What do I do now?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I suppose you should go live your life. You're free, Sayid. [Ben leaves.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sayid sits in the DHARMA cell. The cell is unlocked and Horace and Radzinsky enter. Horace holds a large pair of clippers.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Put out your hands. Come on.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid extends his arms. Horace uses the clippers to remove the bonds from Sayid's wrists.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Thank you.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	It's nice to finally hear your voice. I'm Horace.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid does not respond.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Now's the part where you tell me your name. [Waits.] I need you to tell me what you were doing out in that jungle.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	Ask him about the model.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Radzinsky! I got this. [To Sayid] Those handcuffs...are you having some kind of problem with your people? Because either you're in some kind of disagreement, which makes me want to help you, or you're a spy, trying to infiltrate us. So which is it?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid still does not respond.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Okay. I'm gonna give you an hour to decide whether you want to talk to me. But if you decide you don't want to, then I'm gonna have to take this to the next level.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer walks into his kitchen, notices bacon frying unattended on the stove. He sees Juliet standing by their picture window, staring out. He moves the bacon.]
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I think your bacon's ready.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Occupied] Hmm. I forgot.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's on the TV? [Looks out, sees Kate and Jack walk by.] Ah.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Quietly] It's over, isn't it?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's over?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	This. Us. Playing house. All of it. I never actually thought they'd come back.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So they're back! Nothing's changed.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What if Sayid tells them who he is?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'. [Reassuringly] Hey. I got this under control.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Knock at door. Sawyer opens it.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Horace] Mornin' H.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Jim.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's up?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To Juliet] Juliet.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Horace.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To Sawyer] I just spoke to the prisoner. We have a problem.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[After glancing at Juliet] Why, what'd he say?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Nothing. Which is what worries me. We need to find out why he violated the truce. Why the hell he would come into our territory. I'm just going to have to have Oldham do his thing on him.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That psychopath? No way!
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	What choice do I have?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just let me have a go at him alone.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Be my guest, but I'm telling you, man, he is not gonna talk.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, he'll talk to me.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer enters the surveillance room.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	Mr. LaFleur!
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Take your lunch Phil.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	You going back there alone?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[More slowly] Take your lunch, Phil. [Enters the room where Sayid is imprisoned.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Concerned] How you doin'?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Drily] A twelve-year-old Ben Linus brought me a chicken salad sandwich. How do you think I'm doing?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Sarcastically] Sweet kid, huh?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How can you live with him here?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	'Cause I ain't got a choice.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Is that so?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let's see how you feel after three years of livin' in the seventies. Lucky for you, I spent that time gettin' myself into a position to save your ass. [Opens and enters the cell.] I'm sorry, Sayid. [Head butts Sayid.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you doing?!
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	When I tell them I got your confession I need them to believe that you didn't give it up easy.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What confession?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We're gonna say you were trying to defect. You're gonna offer some intel on the others in exchange for living with us.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And why in God's name would I want to do that?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell else am I supposed to do with you?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Let me go!
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And then what? I can't just let you go!
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why not?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	'Cause these people trust me! I've built a life here - and a pretty good one. I let you go, all that goes away. So you got yourself a choice, Chief. Either you cooperate and join the party in Dharmaville, or you're on your own.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then I guess I'm on my own.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the cafeteria, Hurley brings food to Jack and Kate's table.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Fresh off the griddle. And don't forget to try the dipping sauces. They really bring out the ham.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks, Hurley.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So... [sighs] What's going on with Sayid?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't know anything yet.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you mean, you don't know anything? I thought you were at Sawyer's last night. What did he tell you?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And you're going to?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, why wouldn't she?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	'Cause they're together.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you mean, they're together?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	"Together" as... They live together. Like, not as roommates. You know, "together" like you guys were. I thought it was kind of obvious. I mean, who couldn't see that comin'?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, I guess I better... Go make some more waffles.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Did you know?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hmm.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In Sayid's cell room, Roger Linus enters with a mop and a bucket. He begins mopping the floor whilst looking at Sayid.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	You know what I can't figure out? Is how the hell you got caught. You hostiles are supposed to be the kings of the jungle. And how dumb are you that you got captured by these idiots? [He laughs]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And yet you're the one who mops up after them.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	Yeah, well... We'll see how cute you are once Oldham gets done with you, pal.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mop clatters. Ben enters with a sandwich and stops when he sees his father.]
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	What the hell are you doing here?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	[inhales sharply] I was bringing you a sandwich.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	A sandwich?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Roger scoffs.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	You never made me a sandwich in your life.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Yeah, well... I-I made one for myself...
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	Uh-huh.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	So... So I just thought that I'd bring you--
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	Oh, yeah? You just...
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He grabs Ben by the arm.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	[gasps] Dad, don't!
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	Don't you lie to me. What are you doin' down here?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pushes Ben into the bars of Sayid's cell.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	You made this sandwich for him, didn't you? Hmm?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	[voice breaks] Yes.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	Who told you to do that?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Nobody.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	[whispers] Nobody?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	I just thought that--
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	You "just thought," huh? Go home.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Releases him.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	[cries]
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROGER	Go on. I'll tell you what to think.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben leaves. Roger looks at Sayid, then throws the plate and sandwich at the wall. He slams the door as he leaves.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - At a "Build Our World" worksite, Sayid picks up some lengths of timber and carried them to a shed.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Title card: Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the shed, Sayid senses someone behind him and turns around. It is Ben.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you find me?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I looked.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you want, Ben?
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	John Locke is dead. I think he was murdered.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why would anyone kill him?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'd say it was retribution for the work you and I have been doing. So you're in danger, Sayid. If I can find you, so can the people that found Locke. The same people who, even as we speak, are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	They're watching him?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	A man in a sedan has been there all week, just waiting... presumably for you or me to show our faces.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And that's why you're here? You actually came all this way to suggest that I kill this man?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You don't want to?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What makes you think I want to?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because, Sayid... to put it simply, you're capable of things that most other men aren't. Every choice you've made in your life, whether it was to murder or to torture, it hasn't really been a choice at all, has it? It's in your nature. It's what you are. You're a killer, Sayid.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm not what you think I am. I don't like killing.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, then I apologize. I was mistaken about you.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sawyer, Phil, Radzinsky and two unnamed DHARMA members enter the jail room. Sawyer unlocks the cell and approaches Sayid.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Sayid] All right, last chance. You got anything to say?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid does not reply. Sawyer sighs and shocks him. Sayid drops to the floor.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[sighs] Take him to Oldham.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The other members enter the cell and handcuff Sayid.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A DHARMA van pulls up in the jungle. Phil, Radzinsky, Horace and Sawyer exit, while pulling out a handcuffed Sayid. They all walk towards a tent. A phonograph is playing a record.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(bluesy jazz playing on phonograph) WOMAN: # I can't give you # # anything # # but love # # baby # # that's the only thing # # I've plenty of #]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Oldham.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[# baby #]
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Hey, man. Are we ready?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[# dream a while, scheme a while # # you're sure to find # # happiness # # and I guess-- #]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A man steps out of the tent and takes the needle off of the record.]
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[To Sawyer] [lowered voice] Who is that man?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[lowered voice] He's our you.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Oldham approaches Sayid and drops an unknown liquid onto a sugar cube. He attempts to put the cube in Sayid's mouth, but he turns away.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	Better put him in the restraints.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Radzinsky and Phil drag Sayid over to some restraints attached to some trees and strap him in.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	[To Sayid] Don't worry. They're for your protection. There are side effects to what I'm giving you. [To Phil] Open his mouth.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Radzinsky and Phil grap Sayid's head and force his mouth open.]
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	Open up.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Oldham inserts the sugar cube. Radzinsky and Phil quickly shut his mouth and hold it shut.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	[To Sayid] Don't be afraid. Just turn your mind off. Let it take effect.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Radzinsky and Phil let go of Sayid. Sayid rushes forward to Oldham, but is held back by the restraints.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	[To Sayid] It's beyond your control, so fighting it is a poor use of your energies. You see, whether you struggle or not, one thing's for sure, friend. You will tell us the truth.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - A familiar scene at the Long Beach Marina. Sun is holding Ben at gun point.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[To Sun] There's somebody--somebody here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Who?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Is that what this is about? This is insane. You are all crazy.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Sayid, where are you going?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate retreats to her car and drives away. Sayid turns away. Car door closes, engine starts.]
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't want any part of this.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tires sqealing.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Pointing at Ben] And if I see you again, it'll be extremely unpleasant for us both.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid walks away.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid is sipping a whisky in a bar.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Ahh.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Do you have a menu?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BARTENDER	There you go. [To Sayid] Sir? Another MacCutcheon?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Please.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	[The woman is Ilana] What's that run you?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Excuse me?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	That scotch. What's a glass of that run you?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Whatever it is, it's worth it.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid sips his drink.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	I don't understand why someone would pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If you knew what my drink cost, why did you ask me?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Same reason I'm eating my dinner here instead of a table. [To the bartender] I'll have the rib eye, bloody.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BARTENDER	Yes, ma'am. Rib eye, bloody.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Indistinct conversations.]
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you a professional?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	A professional what? You think I'm a prostitute? Mm. I'm not a professional anything. I just... Thought you looked sad. I like sad men.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm sorry to hear that.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ilana moves closer to Sayid.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	So... Other than drinking alone at bars...what do you do? For a living.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm between jobs at the moment.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid sips his drink.]
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	So what did you do?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The only thing I was ever good at.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Then why did you quit?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm trying to change.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	I know why you're sad now.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Do you?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	When you are that good at something, there are always going to be people who tempt you into staying the same.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And how do you know so much about temptation?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Buy me a glass of that scotch, and I'll tell you.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sayid stares blankly into the sky.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To Sayid] Hello there. Hello?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid hears Horace and turns to look at him.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	I'm going to ask you a few questions. I want you to relax and answer them truthfully... Not that you'll have any choice about it. What is your name?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Clearly drugged] Sayid. Sayid Jarrah.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	All right, Sayid. Why were you in handcuffs when we found you?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Because...because I am a bad man.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	Were you running away from your people?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What people?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	The hostiles.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I am not a hostile.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Then where did you come from, Sayid?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I came on a plane.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	What plane?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Ajira flight 3-1-6. And that's how I returned to the island.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	"Returned"? You've been here before?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Oh, yes. The first time, I was on Oceanic flight 8-1-5. It crashed. I was here for a hundred days. Then I left. Ask Sawyer.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	Who's "Sawyer"?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	Who cares?! None of this matters. Ask him about the Flame.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To Radzinsky] Quiet.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	What do you know about our stations here?
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I know the Flame was a communication station. The Pearl was to observe other stations. The Swan was to study electromagnetism. But, of course, that was before the incident--
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	[Interrupting] The Swan?! How could he know what we were gonna name it? We haven't even built it yet! I told you! He saw the model! You see?! He is a spy!
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To Radzinsky] Hey!
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	I knew it!
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Radzinsky! I'm not gonna tell you again. Cool it.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[To everyone] You're all going to die, you know.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To Sayid] What?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're going to be killed.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	How exactly would you know this, Sayid?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Because I am from the future.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLDHAM	[To Horace] Maybe I should've used half a dropper. Oops.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid begins to laugh uncontrollably.]
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You... You used exactly enough.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid continues to laugh.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Motor Pool, Juliet is showing Kate around.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Bench grinder, lube equipment, drill press over here. Plugs, bearings, sockets, ratchets here. How are you with a flat four engine? You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, not really.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's okay. Jack told you about us...
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No. Hurley, actually.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's kind of a relief, actually. I wasn't quite sure how to do it without it sounding like I was telling you to stay away.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's fine.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The DHARMA van containing Sayid returns to the Barracks. Everyone gets out. Kate and Juliet look on, concerned. Sayid and Sawyer look back towards them.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A group of DHARMA members are gathered inside a house.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	[To everyone] All right... What do we do with him?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	We kill him.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hold on a second. We're not killing anyone, right?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	He violated the truce. What do you think they would do if they caught one of us?
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Since when did we start acting like them? We're civilized.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HOACE	Yes, we are. We have a rule of law. And we've given him every opportunity to defend himself.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind you, this man's seen things? He knows things. There's nothing to talk about. He's a spy.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You sure about that, Stu? He was trying to escape from the hostiles. He obviously has problems with his people.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	Yeah, and sharing our secrets are the quickest way for him to solve those problems.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HOACE	Okay, I'm gonna need a little more time to consider.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	[scoffs] Consider? I mean, the longer he's among us, the--the more danger we're in.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I can talk to him, Horace. I just need more time.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	[Interrupting] No, you had your chance, LaFleur!
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why are we on your clock, Radzinsky?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	Horace, you've got to call for a vote. [sighs] Either we make a decision, or I call Ann Arbor...and they make it for us.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMY	Radzinsky's right. Horace, please...
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ethan fussing.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMY	I can't... I can't sleep with one eye open. We have a baby now. We have to think about Ethan. We have to think about all the children here. How are we going to feel safe with this man around? I don't know what he's up to, but we can't keep him here. We have no choice.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Horace sighs.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	Okay. Let's put it to a vote. All in favor of Radzinsky's solution, raise your hand.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone in the room raises their hand, except Sawyer.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADZINSKY	[To Sawyer] LaFleur?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Horace turns to Sawyer.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HORACE	I would really like to say it's unanimous.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks over at Radzinsky. He then reluctantly raises his hand.]
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sayid and Ilana burst into a room while kissing.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Mmm. Just for the record, I really was just there for dinner.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ilana chuckles.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Mmm.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ilana jumps onto the bed.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	I think it's too late for that.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid holds Ilana's leg.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Take it off.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ilana sighs.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid starts to unzip Ilana's boot. She suddenly kicks him in the face twice and throws him onto the bed, elbowing him in the face and pulling a gun on him before he can fight back.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	You so much as flinch, and you're dead.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	So who are you?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	You asked me earlier if I was a professional. I am a professional. I was hired to bring you to Guam.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who hired you?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	The family of Peter Avellino--the man you killed in cold blood last year on a golf course in the Seychelles.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're a bounty hunter?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Doesn't matter what I am. You're going to answer for what you've done.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sawyer unlocks Sayid's cell and enters. Sayid is sat on the bed.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Sayid] Hit me in the face.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[chuckles] What?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Go on. You owe me one anyway, so make it a good one.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keys jangle.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Then I want you to take these keys out of my pocket and let yourself out. The guard outside is Phil. He's a dimwit, so I reckon you can get his gun before he even realizes you're out. Just promise me you won't shoot him.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine right here.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They're gonna kill you. They just took a vote. Even the new mom wants you dead.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm going to stay here, James.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	This morning, you were begging me to let you go. Why would you change your--
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Interrupting] Because...when I woke up in the jungle and I realized I was back on this island...I felt there was no purpose to it. But now I know exactly why I'm here.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	To get shot? Then what? You're out of your mind.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer sighs, then leaves the cell, locking it behind him.]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer returns home, but changes his mind on the doorstep and walks across to Kate's house. He knocks and she answers.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hi.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why'd you come back?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sayid just filled my ear full of some crap about his damn purpose, and I wanna know... Why'd y'all come back?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh...
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why, Kate?
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't know why everyone else came back. I just know why I did.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They are interruptted by the sound of a speeding van. Sawyer turns around to see a burning DHARMA van speeding through some fences. It crashes into a house.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What? What the hell?!
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Kate run to the scene and start to help in tackling the blaze. A woman smashes the window and jumps from it.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Alarm blaring.]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you ok?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Man shouting indistinctly. Sawyer runs to a water tank and turns the valve.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Craig! Grab a wrench, open those valves. Get the hoses going.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Okay.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate assists a woman as she climbs out of the window. People shouting. The fuel tank on the van explodes.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Aah!
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Erin, grab the fire gear! Bill, go help Craig.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack runs to the scene.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Sawyer] What the hell happened?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Three years--no burning buses. Y'all are back for one day... Get on that hose.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet runs to the scene and grabs a hose. Jack grabs a hose and sprays it on the fire.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Man this hose!
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Push it out!
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[On walkie] All security! All security! This is LaFleur! We have a fire! Everyone get to building 15 now!
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Phil hears the call in the Security Office.]
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	[On walkie] Roger that. I'm on my way.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He grabs a gun and exits the Security Office. A hooded figure sneaks into the office and walks into the cell room. Sayid is standing at the bars, hands crossed.]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[To hooded figure] What happened to your glasses?
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The figure is young Ben.]
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	My dad.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	For bringing me the sandwich? I know. My father was a hard man as well.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	[voice breaks] I really hate it here. If I let you out...will you take me with you, to your people?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes, Ben, I will. That's why I'm here.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - At Los Angeles International Airport.]
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TANNOY	Attention, passengers. Ajira Airways flight 3-16 to Honolulu and Guam...
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid is being walked through the airport, handcuffed, by Ilana. Sayid spots Hurley at the check-in counter.]
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you sure we're going to Guam?
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Where else would we be going?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They continue to walk. Sayid notices Jack approaching Hurley, and then Kate sat on the seats. Indistinct conversations.]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Can I ask you a favor? Can we get the next plane?
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Why?
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm very superstitious when it comes to flying.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	I'll buy you a rabbit's foot at the gift shop. This is the plane we're taking.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid and Ilana are on the plane, before take off. He spots Sun a few rows back.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Sorry about the handcuffs, but at least we're in business.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben boards the plane.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid stares at Ben, clearly surprised. Ben glaces back.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's he doing here?! No, no, he can't come!
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, hey, if you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[To Ilana] Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	What?
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you working for him?
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Who's Benjamin Linus?
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He's a liar, a manipulator...a man who allowed his own daughter to be murdered to save himself... A monster responsible for nothing short of genocide.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Why would I work for somebody like that?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I did.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back at the Barracks, young Ben unlocks the cell door and frees Sayid.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They run through the jungle, but get caught in the headlights of an on-coming DHARMA van. Ben trips and falls.]
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Whoa! Aah!
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Hide!
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The van stops. Engine turns off. The driver steps out with a flash light and a gun. The driver is Jin.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jin?
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[sighs] Sayid. What are you doing here? How did you get out?
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Sawyer let me go. They were going to kill me.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	What?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Static.]
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHIL	[On walkie] Attention. The prisoner escaped. The hostile is no longer in custody. Be on the lookout. He could be armed.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	They don't know he released me. Please, Jin, I need to keep moving.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Okay. Let me talk to him first. [on the walkie] LaFleur, it's Jin here. Come in.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Before anyone on the walkie can respond, Sayid grabs Jin and throws him to the floor. Then he hits him in the face, knocking him unconscious.]
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid picks up Jin's gun.]
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	Come on. We better go. He called LaFleur.
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You were right about me.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG BEN	What?
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I am a killer.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid looks up and shoots young Ben in the chest once. Ben falls to the floor instantly. Sayid lowers the gun and wipes a tear, then he runs into the jungle, leaving Ben for dead.]
