10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate walking up the beach with bananas. She finds Sawyer's clothes and a paperback edition of Watership Down.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[from the ocean] Hell of a book. It's about bunnies.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer coming out of the ocean naked.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[looking Sawyer up and down] Must be cold without your trunks.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You bet. How about you come a little closer and warm me up?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks away.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sawyer in a hotel room in bed with a woman, Jess.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	You're incredible Sawyer.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I love you. Look at you. What do you want, right now?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	How could I want anything else?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jess notices the time.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	Oh, uh-oh, baby.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, what.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	I thought you had a meeting.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, but it's not until 3:30.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	Baby, it's 3:28.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Damn it. Damn it. Baby, why don't you just, uh...
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	No, just go. You go, okay, I'll stay here -- order room service, get fat.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why don't you order a chocolate sundae -- when I get back, I'll use you as a dish.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pulls a brief case from on top of the armoire and money spills out.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Sawyer in the jungle. He hears rustling noises. He starts running and comes across Boone in his stuff.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What are you doing in my stuff, son?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid being doctored by Jack.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This is going to hurt. Ready to tell me what happened?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We were trying to find the source of the distress call. I saw the flare from the beach and then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle. I switched on my antenna, activated the transceiver, and then -- darkness. Whoever hit me came from behind.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And destroyed the equipment?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Listen, we're going to figure this out, but don't do anything...
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I will do whatever I need to do to find the man responsible.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon and Boone enter the caves. Boone is wounded.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	We need some help over here.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What happened?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Sawyer.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Claire writing in her diary. Charlie approaches with some water.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Morning delivery.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Awww, you're sweet, thanks.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, I figured in your condition, with the extra baggage, you know...
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Well, I can still walk.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Barely. Anyway, I worry about you out here. You know, it's very -- sunny.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thus, my hat.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	There's plenty of hats in the caves. And we've got a doctor there, as well. That'll come in handy.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I like the beach, Charlie.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, who wouldn't want to spend the day with sand fleas.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I want to be here -- for when we get rescued.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	When we get rescued, right.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Boone getting doctored by Jack.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Jack, it's fine. It's just a scrape.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, lot's of scrapes today. I'm running out of peroxide.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	He just jumped me man. I didn't...
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why?
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon has asthma.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Asthma?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I've never seen her have an attack before.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Because she had an inhaler. She's sneaks hits when no one's looking. She's been embarrassed about it since she was a little kid. I guess breathing's not cool.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Had an inhaler?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It ran out a couple of days ago. But I had 4 refills which should have been enough for a couple of months. But she always forgets her medication so I put it my suitcase. Today I see that jackass reading Watership Down.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're losing me.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It was in my bags, the stuff that I checked. If he has my book he has my luggage, if he has the luggage he has the inhalers. Her breathing got really rough today, man. If she has an attack, it's not going to be good.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer reading his letter, smoking a cigarette. Jack enters and starts going through Sawyer's stuff. Sawyer folds his letter fast.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is it?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, Doc. Long time no see.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is it?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where's what?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The girl's asthma medicine. Shannon -- her inhalers.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, that.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You attacked a kid for trying to help his sick sister.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No, I whooped a thief cuz he was going through my stuff.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yours? What makes it yours? What, you think you can just take something out of a suitcase and that makes it yours?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Which I had to move because everybody just wants to help themselves. Look, I don't know what kind of commie share-fest you're running over in cave town, but down here possession's 9/10ths. And a man's got a right to protect his property.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Get up.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why, you want to see who's taller?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Get up.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You sure you want to make this your problem, Doc?
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh yeah. I'm sure.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer gets up. Kate enters.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, what's going on here?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks away, Kate follows.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sawyer and Jess are in the hotel room.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	You told me you were going to Baton Rouge to close a deal.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just trust me, there isn't any time to explain. I'm already late. I miss this meeting, the whole deal's a bust, alright? That's everything I have. 140,000 dollars. There's an oil mining operation in the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling platforms. 300,000 dollars buys one share, but as soon as you invest a Government sponsored fund kicks in and triples your money in two weeks. Triples it.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	300,000?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	You've got 140.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I found an investor in Toronto -- wants in 50/50. In two weeks we'll be splitting almost a million bucks. Jess, this is my chance.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	There's another option.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, and what's that?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	That I give you the 160,000 and we split the profit.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, and how in the hell are you going to scare up 160,000 bucks?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	My husband.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Kate and Jack on beach.]
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going to kill him.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That's not going to help us get the medicine.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Maybe not, but it'll feel good.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So what's stopping you?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're not savages, Kate. Not yet.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Let me talk to Sawyer.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He says we have a connection.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Please.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer chopping wood.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you want?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Excuse me?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you want, Sawyer?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Freckles, I got so many answers to that question, I wouldn't even know where to start.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you want for the inhalers?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ah, good question. Hang on a tick. What do I want? A kiss ought to do it.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	A kiss, from you, right now?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't buy it.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Buy what?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The act. You try too hard, Sawyer. I ask you to help a woman who can't breath and you want me to kiss you? Nobody's that disgusting. I've seen you, you know.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Seen me what?
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	With that piece of paper -- the one you keep in your pocket. Seen the expression on your face when you read it and how carefully you fold it up. It means something to you. So you can play games all you want, but I know there's a human being in there somewhere. Give me the medication.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You think you understand me?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. I think I have...
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Shut up. You want to know what kind of human being I am? [He hands her his letter] Read it. Read it. Out loud.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Dear Mr. Sawyer, you don't know who I am but I know who you are and I know what you done. You had sex with my mother and then you stole my dad's money all away. So he got angry and he killed my mother and then he killed himself, too.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't stop now. You're just getting to the good part.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	All I know is your name. But one of these days I'm going to find you and I'm going to give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me. You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now about that kiss... I didn't think so.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a knife sharpening a stick to a point.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Locke, where were you last night, around sunset?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, I'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar that I was skinning for our dinner. I heard you were trying to send out a distress call. So it would seem whoever attacked you has a reason for not wanting to get off the Island. Maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances? And from what I've seen you and Mr. Sawyer share a certain animosity.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, he has an alibi. Just before I was struck, he set off a bottle rocket, a signal we had worked out -- 2 kilometers away. He wouldn't have the time to go...
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Unless he found a way to time delay the fuse on his rocket.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How could he possibly have...
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Anyone who watches television knows how to improvise a slow fuse. Use a cigarette. [Locke offers Sayid his knife] Just in case there's a next time.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon gasping. Shot of Jack looking through his stash of medicine. We see Sun looking on.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Just try to breathe. Breathe. Come on Shann work with me.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer walks to the caves to get some water. Jack approaches.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Give me the inhalers -- now.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hell, I wondered when you were going to stop asking nice.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack punches him.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, it's about time, cowboy. Been telling you since day one, we're in the wild. Didn't think you had it in you.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack punches him again.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That all you got?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack notices that everyone is watching him. He shakes his head and walks away.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer at a restaurant with Jess and her husband, David.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm not sure this is such a good idea.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	Why not?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because business between friends is always a little sticky. I don't know you well, but I know your wife. Working with her at the auto dealership, I'm just not sure I'm comfortable.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Louisiana will invest two thirds of the drilling costs. What is this? A loophole?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look, David, you're reluctant. I get it. You got your lumbar yard, you don't need this.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	You should do this.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Jess, I don't even know this guy.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	Show him the cash.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	How do I know this is real?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The money? Hell, how about you hold on to it for a night. Check it out. I want you to feel secure. You know what? Let's not do this. I've got another investor who's already committed.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	David?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[putting 300 down on the table] This should cover lunch. And I'll see you Monday [to Jess]. David.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	David?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Wait.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer stops and smiles to himself.]
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Claire and Charlie on the beach.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Warm fluffy towels. Your turn.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Uh, banoffee pie.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You already said that.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Toffee and cream, mmmm.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Is food the only thing that you miss?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You're pregnant. I mean, do you not crave anything? Pickles, fried ice cream, chocolate?
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Peanut butter. I'm the only Australian who loves peanut butter.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I could get you peanut butter.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, sure you can.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yes, I can. And when I get you peanut butter you have to vacate this sandy shore of depression and move to the caves. Deal?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Deal.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They shake hands.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon gasping.]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Help, she's not breathing! The attacks are getting worse.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Shannon, listen to me. Look at me, look at me. You need to listen now. This isn't just the asthma, it's anxiety. It's in your head.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	No.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes. You know that your medicine's run out and you're panicking. Shannon, Shannon, look at me. We can fight this, together, okay? Nod your head, Shannon. Good. Breathe in through...
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	She needs her inhaler.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Boone! [to Shannon] Breathe in through your nose, slowly. No, no, no. In through the nose, like this. You can do this Shannon. You can do it. In through the nose. You got your breath. Yeah. Your color's coming back. See, I knew you could do this. Do you feel it?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yes.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's passing. Okay. Again, in through the nose. Alright, just keep doing that. Keep breathing like that. That's perfect, good job.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack takes Boone aside.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Keep her relaxed. Do not let her panic.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah. Yeah.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wow, man. That was awesome. I mean, that was like a -- Jedi moment.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack walking out of the caves. Sayid follows.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack, what will happen if she doesn't get the medicine? [Jack shrugs] Then we have to make Sawyer give it to us.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, not you, me. I served 5 years in the Republican Guard.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I thought you were a communications officer?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Part of my training entailed getting the enemy to communicate. Just give me 10 minutes with him. He'll give us the medicine. [Jack doesn't respond] Is that a yes?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[taking a long moment] Yes.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie and Hurley walking in the jungle.]
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Food from the plane's been gone for over a week, dude.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What, no secret stash for emergencies? You and Jack have got a bunch of stuff in that cave.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry, man. No peanut butter. No peanuts. No nothing.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, but, there's got to be something. I mean, look at you.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look at what?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, no. Listen.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Fat guy hoarding the food, is that what you think?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No. It's just we've been here for two weeks and you've not really...
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Slimmed down much?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	All I need is a bag of peanuts.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I have no food, alright?! And for the record, I'm down a notch in my belt. I'm a big guy, it's going to be a while before you're going to want to give me a piggy back ride, okay?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry. Sorry, that was bad form.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah. I'm used to it.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, not even a bag of...
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay. Alright, I'm sorry.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael trying to clean a fish and getting it all over himself.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Aaah, damn, stupid...
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Michael -- the sick girl. [Sun makes breathing sounds]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah. Asthma.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes, asthma. I think I can help her.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer sleeping in an airline seat. He awakens and looks up to see Sayid.]
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[with a big metal pipe poised over Sawyer's head] Good morning.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Sayid dragging Sawyer away.]
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you doing? Jack!
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This was Sawyer's choice, not mine.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	If you do this!
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer tied to a tree. Sayid splashes water on his face to bring him to.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, ain't you the brave one, jumping a guy while he's napping. Uh-oh, I'm in trouble now, ain't I?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer, I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing. Now, all I want is the asthma medicine. Just tell me where the inhalers are and we'll stop.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Stop what, Chico?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid making bamboo spikes.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It doesn't have to be this way.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, it does.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We do not have bamboo in Iraq, although we do have something similar -- reeds. But their effect is the same when the shoots are inserted underneath the fingernails.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You know what I think, Ali. I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Unfortunately for us both, you're wrong.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid starts with the bamboo under the fingernails.]
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's it? That's all you got? Splinters? No wonder we kicked your ass in the Gulf... [he screams]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sayid. Sayid!
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No. Don't stop now. I think my sinuses are clearing.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What the hell is wrong with you?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Perhaps losing an eye will loosen your tongue?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, okay.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Where is it?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The only person I'll tell is her.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's the deal.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sawyer playing pool with his buddy Kilo in a pool hall.]
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KILO	Tell me Sawyer, do you want to die? Because when a man walks in my place and tells me he left a 160,000 of my hard won dollars in the care of a civilian I've got to ask myself if what I'm hearing isn't the desperate cry for the sweet release of death.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Deal closed today. See, women are easy -- a few cosmos, a couple of stunts they haven't seen between the sheets, and they think the scam's their idea. Now husbands, they need to touch the money, smell it -- believe that if they had the brass to put that suitcase in the trunk of their family sedan and speed away, they just might have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KILO	Okay, Tex. You got your grift so pat, what'd you need my money for? Where's your seed from the last couple you roped?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, what can I say? I like earning it as much as I like spending it.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KILO	Be that as it may, I know a thing or two about making people suffer. Now you have my money, plus 50%, by noon tomorrow or I'll tell you all about it.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Kate with Sawyer.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So I'm here. Where is it?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Happy to tell you, as soon as I get that kiss.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What? Are you serious?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Baby, I am tied to a tree in a jungle of mystery. I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a gen-u-ine I-raqi. Of course, I'm serious. You're just not seeing the big picture here, Freckles. You really going to let that girl suffocate because you can't bring yourself to give me one little kiss? Hell, it's only first base. Lucky for you I ain't greedy.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss.]
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't have it.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The medicine. I don't have it, never did.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The book -- they said you found it in their luggage.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The book washed up on shore, went in the drink with the rest of-
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate elbows him across the face. Then we see her walking toward Jack and Sayid.]
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He doesn't have it.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He's lying. Can't you see that? He's been lying from the beginning. He doesn't want us to get off this Island. That's why he attacked me.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hold on a minute.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He destroyed the transceiver!
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You don't know that. Sayid!
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid runs back to Sawyer. Sawyer is loosening the bindings on his wrist. Sayid and Sawyer struggle. Sayid stabs him in the arm. Sayid holds his arms out, like it was an accident. Jack pulls the knife out, blood spurts out.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You hit an artery. [to Sawyer] Keep still damn it. Sayid, I need my stuff from the caves, my leather backpack. Go.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is pinching Sawyer's artery closed.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Can you make it stop?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid back at the caves. Boone sitting with Shannon.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[running to Sayid] Whose blood is that? Whose blood is that?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Sawyer.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You went after Sawyer and you didn't even tell me? She's my sister.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone, don't leave me alone, okay?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm not going anywhere, okay?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Okay.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael coming in while Sayid runs out. Sun approaches Michael.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[holding out some branches] Are these the right ones? I think I found the right tree, but I'm guessing.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[smelling the cuttings] Just let me see. Oh yes, good.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin enters.]
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[yelling] Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã«â€ Ë†Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å¾â€˜ Ã«Â­ÂÃ­â€¢ËœÃªÂ³ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´! Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã«â€ Ë†Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å¾â€˜ Ã¬â„¢Å“ Ã«ÂªÂ°Ã«Å¾Ëœ Ã¬â€ºÆ’Ã«Å â€ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬Â§â‚¬? Ã¬Ââ€˜? Ã«Â­ÂÃ¬â€¢Â¼! (What are you doing with him? Why are you sneaking around with this man? What's going on?)
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun walks away. Jin looks at Michael angrily.]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Don't, man. I'm telling you, don't.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate and Jack keeping Sawyer still.]
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let go. I know you want to.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Shut up. And stop moving.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You've been waiting for this, haven't you? Now you get to be the hero again, because that's what you do -- fix everything up all nice. Tell him to let go, Freckles. We already made out, what else I got to live for? Hey, Jack, there's something you should know -- if the tables were turned, I'd watch you die.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sawyer at David and Jess' house, finalizing the deal.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alrighty. It looks like we're in the oil business.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	We're cool?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, we're cool.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	We get the money back?
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Week from tomorrow, tripled.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You're not going to skip town, are you?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	David, for god's sake, he left all his money with us. We could've skipped town.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Smart woman you got there, David. Don't let her go.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A kid comes into the room.]
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	Hi, baby. What are you doing up? Are you feeling better?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOY	Will you read to me?
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	In a minute sweetheart. We have company right now.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer is looking at the kid, very sad.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You okay?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Deal's off.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Excuse me?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Deal's off, forget it.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	What are you doing?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hold on, what is this, a joke?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm calling it off, walking away.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You're not walking out of here. You know what I had to do for this? All this money in one day?!
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Take your hand off me, boy.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	Sawyer?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	What's going on here?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JESS	This isn't how is was supposed to work. You said that we were...!
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Said? What'd he say Jessica?
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer leaves the money and walks out.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Sawyer waking up with bandage, Kate is with him.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're lucky to be alive.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jack?
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Went to the caves to check on Shannon. [She holds up Sawyer's letter] I read it again, and then again, because I've been trying to figure out why you beat up Boone instead of just telling him you didn't have his sister's medication. Why you pretended to have it anyway. The thing that I keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated. Then I looked at the envelope -- America's bicentennial, Knoxville, TN. You were just a kid, 8 maybe 9 years old.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kate.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter. Your name's not Sawyer, is it?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It was his name. He was a confidence man. Romanced my momma to get to the money, wiped them out clean, left a mess behind. So I wrote that letter. I wrote it knowing one day I'd find him. But that ain't the sad part. When I was 19, I needed 6 grand to pay these guys off I was in trouble with. So I found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money. And I got them to give it to me. How's that for a tragedy? I became the man I was hunting. Became Sawyer. Don't you feel sorry for me. [He grabs the letter from her]. Get the hell out. Get out!
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sun putting a Eucalyptus paste on Shannon, holding it in front of her nose.]
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[to Jack] I don't know. It's a miracle. She just showed up with that mixture. She rubbed it on Shannon's chest and 10 minutes later she was breathing.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[smelling it] Eucalyptus -- smart, Jack. [to Sun] Thank you, very much.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie gathering Claire's clothes.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What are you doing?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Packing your stuff, you're moving to the caves.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You didn't? Peanut butter? No way.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Just like you ordered. Oh, there is one thing. It's extra smooth.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	That's okay.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie opens an empty jar.]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	It's empty.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What? No, no it's not. It's full, full to the brim, with stick to the roof of your mouth, oh, god, makes you want a glass of milk extra smooth. It's the best bloody peanut butter I've ever tasted. You want some? [Claire tries the imaginary peanut butter.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate at the beach, looking out at the ocean. Sayid walks by.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid?
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I can't stay here.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm leaving. I don't know for how long.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid, you can't. We still don't know what's out there.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I've worse things to fear than what's in the jungle. What I did today, what I almost did, I swore to do never again. If I can't keep that promise, I have no right to be here.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	There's nowhere to go.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Someone has to walk the shore and map the Island, see what else there is. I can't think of a better person to do it than the only one I trust. I hope we meet again.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He kisses her hand and leaves. A montage follows with "I Shall Not Walk Alone" playing. Charlie and Claire walk to the caves. Boone gives Shannon a bottle of water. Sawyer holds a lighter to his letter but changes his mind. Sayid walks down the beach into the sunset.]
