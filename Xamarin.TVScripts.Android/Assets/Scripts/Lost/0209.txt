6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A shirtless Jin comes out of his tent followed by Sun who snuggles against his back. Hurley comes out of his tent nearby, and gives Jin a thumbs up for getting some. Sun sadly watches Sayid digging Shannon's grave.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the hatch, Jack is changing Sawyer's bandages.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry, man, I know this hurts. Michael told me you pulled the bullet out with your bare hands. You'll have to show me how to do that sometime.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispering] Where is she?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What? I didn't...
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispering] Where is she?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You mean Kate. She's been watching over you for the past 24 hours straight. The only way I could get rid of her was to send her out to get some food for you.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispering] I love her. I love her.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sits down looking disappointed.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate is gathering mangoes in the forest and almost falls from the tree. She sees a black horse which trots off.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Kate sitting outside a house playing with a Zippo lighter. A truck pulls up playing country music and a drunken guy, Wayne, gets out.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WAYNE	Well, heya, girl. What are you doing here? [He grabs onto Kate.] Hey, there.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[annoyed] Alright, let's get you to bed. [She helps him to the bed as he stumbles around.] Watch your step, watch your step.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WAYNE	What the hell is that smell?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Probably your breath.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WAYNE	Sha, right.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Come on.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She puts him in bed and takes off his shoes.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WAYNE	You're beautiful. Hey. Hey! I just gave you a compliment.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I heard you. [Kate puts a blanket on him.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WAYNE	Aren't you going to take my pants off first? [He grabs her arm.] You are beautiful.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[jerking away] Good night.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate exiting the house and getting on a motorcycle. She hesitates a moment and rides off. The house explodes.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate enters a coffee shop and we see her mother, Diane.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	Coffee, pie, both?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How about a beer?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	I'd like to see some I.D.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm 24, Ma.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	You want to ride around on that on that deathtrap of yours without a helmet -- I'm not going to help your cause by getting you drunk.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How's that wrist?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	What, this? No, that shelf in the kitchen sticks out sometimes. You'd think I'd remember it was there, but I banged it.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	I made my bed, Katherine.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, your bed's gone, Ma.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	What?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate hands her an envelope.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	What is this?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	An insurance policy for the house.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	What? I never...
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I took it out in your name.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	What did you do? Does Wayne know about this?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[leaving] Just remember that you were here and you didn't see me, okay.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	Katherine! What did you do?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I took care of you, Ma. I've got to go and you're not going to see me for awhile.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate hugs her and leaves.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	[calling after her] Katherine, what did you do? Katherine!
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Kate in the hatch returning from her fruit gathering trip.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. You okay?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm just -- I think I'm tired. How is he?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	His fever's still up there. I can't tell if the anti-biotics are working. It'll help to get some food in him. You should get down to the beach for -- for Shannon.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I was actually thinking that I should stay and watch Sawyer.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll stay with him.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You should be there.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Keep him hydrated -- maybe mash up some of that fruit and see if you can get him to eat it. And everybody'll be at the beach, so don't forget the button.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I got it.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll be back in a couple of hours. -- You're sure you're okay?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I'm great.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana banging a stake into the ground as Eko approaches.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Hey.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I'm going to go to the funeral.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	I don't think I'm going to make it.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I think most of them realize it was an accident, Ana.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At Shannon's funeral.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Shannon and I were strangers. We never would have met if... We wouldn't even have spoken if... But we did meet and we did speak. At least... I loved her.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid walks away. Jack grabs a handful of dirt to pour on Shannon's grave.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	May she rest in peace.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Sun, Claire start filing past the grave to put the ritual handful of dirt on the grave.]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate puts on a Patsy Kline record, and starts talking to Sawyer even though he's unconscious.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You hungry? I'm just going to mash you up some fruit here. When you wake up you're going to get a kick out of me feeding you like a baby. I saw a horse. Yeah, that's what happens when you don't sleep.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer starts to stir and whisper.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispers something unintelligible]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer? Are you awake?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispers something unintelligible]
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer opens his eyes and grabs Kate's throat.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispering] Why did you kill me? [yelling] Why did you kill me?!
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the hatch, we see the record needle at the end of the album. The alarm is going off. Jack and Locke run in.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's the alarm.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate! Kate!
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke runs to enter the numbers. Jack finds Sawyer lying on the floor.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	4, 8, 15, 16, 22. Gah. [He hits the backspace key as there are 5 seconds left on the countdown.] 23, 42.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The timer resets. Jack lifts Sawyer back into the bed.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What happened?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, you said-
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know, John!
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, where's Kate?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie comes upon Kate walking in the jungle.]
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Kate, hey. You missed the funeral.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, uh, I was with Sawyer.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, right. A few of them came -- the new people. Not her -- the one who killed Shannon. That would have been a bit awkward. They seem to have had a rough time of it. It looks like they went bloody Lord of the Flies out there. [Kate stops and stares into the distance.] You haven't listened to a word I've said.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do you think there are horses here?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I think I saw a horse in the jungle.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I've seen polar bears. I've seen monsters, well, heard monsters, but horses, no. [Kate starts walking away.] Kate! Where are you going?!
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Kate buying a bus ticket.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Tallahassee one-way, please.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The guy in line behind her starts talking, but we can only see the back of him.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY IN LINE	Tallahassee? I spent a week in Tallahassee one night. It's all strip malls and waffle houses. What's a pretty girl like you going to do down in Tallahassee?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sure I'll find something.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GUY IN LINE	I'll bet you've got family down there, huh?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Actually, I'm just visiting.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Reveal of the Marshal as the guy in the line.]
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Hey, hey, don't I know you?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks around and notices a couple of agents in the bus terminal.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, I don't think so. [She tries to walk out.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Don't run, Kate.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She punches him a couple of times and he cuffs her. The other agents run up.]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	I've got her. Kate Austen, you're under arrest for murder.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I didn't do anything.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Oh, yeah you did. Your mama gave you up, Kate.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Charlie playing guitar on the beach, as Jack enters.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, have you seen Kate?
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	A little while ago in the jungle. She was acting kind of barmy, asking me about horses on the island.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know where she is now?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	She's on the path heading back to the caves. Everything okay?
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, Charlie, everything's fine.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke using bolt cutters to cut the handcuff off of Jin's wrist.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[shaking Locke's hand] Thank you.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Free at last, huh?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin starts to leave and shows the cuff to Michael on his way out.]
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, man. Looks good.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael is examining a metal strip on the ceiling of the hatch.]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, Locke, what's up with the blast doors?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Blast doors?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, like in case of an explosion they come from the ceiling. That guy down here, uh...
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Desmond?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Desmond. He didn't tell you about these -- what they're for?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, no he didn't. But he did leave a movie.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	A movie?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah. You want to see it?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[appearing] I would like to see it too -- if you don't mind.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why not? The more the merrier.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sitting in the jungle. Jack walks up.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, what the hell are you doing out here? What happened in the hatch, Kate? Why'd you leave? I come back, I find Sawyer just lying on the ground. You just took off...
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Is he okay?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes, Kate, he's fine.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sorry.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I am not as perfect as you! I'm sorry that I'm not as good!
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, what's going on with you?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Just forget it.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[grabbing her arm] No, don't walk away from me.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[struggling] Let go of me. Just...
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. Kate. [He grabs her] Kate, Kate, Kate.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't! I've got... [she starts to cry]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[hugging her] It's okay. It's okay.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Please, this place is crazy -- it's just -- I can't -- it's driving me nuts.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know. It's okay. It's alright. It's alright.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate kisses him, looks confused, and runs off.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate!
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Michael, and Eko watching part of the film.]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARVIN CANDLE	From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor [splice] induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert [splice] utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer [splice] for anything [splice]. Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Alright, so you've been pushing that button every 2 hours since you got down here.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's right.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	How does that even work?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I set up 2 person shifts -- 6 hours -- everyone's on the roster.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Don't they want to know why?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think the film's pretty self-explanatory.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Really? All I heard was something about electro-magnets and an incident. What about all the missing pieces?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, you mean the splices? Yeah, just a frame here and there, I think -- nothing important. [to Eko] What do you think? About the film -- what do you think?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko doesn't say anything, but gets up and leaves.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sitting, teary, at Shannon's grave, as Sayid approaches.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sorry I missed it -- her funeral -- I had to be with Sawyer, so...
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why aren't you with him now?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because I'm going crazy. Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I saw Walt in the jungle just before Shannon was shot. Does that make me crazy?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Kate in handcuffs in a car with the Marshal on a rainy night.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	It's a long drive back to the arraignment, you comfy? [He laughs.] Why now?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Nice, corn fed farm girl like yourself -- no history of violence, straight A's, no record, couple of speeding tickets... I just got to wonder, why'd you kill him now? [Kate doesn't respond.] Oh, right, yeah, don't tell me. You wouldn't want to incriminate yourself, not after you were so smart planning it. That jury back in Iowa sure ain't going to get hung up on pre-meditation. And a gas leak, come on, it's -- it's amateur hour from top to bottom.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sounds like you've got it all figured out.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	I do have you all figured out.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You don't know anything about me.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	White trash mom divorces dad, starts up with some guy who's a drinker. Then he knocks her around a little bit, she marries him, because, you know, that's what happens. And then this drunk, this Wayne, he moves into your house, and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom right there in your daddy's old bedroom. And even that wouldn't be so bad if he didn't beat her up all the time. But she loves him. She defends him. If that don't make a person want to kill somebody I don't know what does. But the question is now, why now? Why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor Wayne up? He come knocking on your door late at night?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He never touched me.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly there's a black horse in the road and the car crashes into a pole. The Marshal is knocked out and Kate grabs the keys to the cuffs. He tries to stop her but she kicks him out of the car and starts driving off. She sees the horse standing there looking at her, and then drives off.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Michael and Locke in the hatch.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Why can't you just put the numbers in now?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It doesn't work that way. The alarm goes off at 4 minutes. You can't type anything until then. [Locke presses some keys to show nothing happens on the screen.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You mind if I check out some of this hardware?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sure. -- Just don't break it.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke walks toward the kitchen and finds Eko sitting at the table.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello again.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Hello. I have something I think you should see. If you don't mind, I will begin at the beginning. Long before Christ the king of Judah was a man named Josiah.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Boy when you say beginning, you mean -- beginning.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	At that time the temple where the people worshiped was in ruin. And so the people worshiped idols, false gods. And so the kingdom was in disarray. Josiah, since he was a good king, sent his secretary to the treasury and said: "We must rebuild the temple. Give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done." But when the secretary returned, he had no gold. And when Josiah asked why this was, the secretary replied, "We found a book." Do you know this story?
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, I'm afraid I don't.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	What the secretary had found was an ancient book -- the Book of Law. You may know it as the Old Testament. And it was with that ancient book, not with the gold, that Josiah rebuilt the temple. On the other side of the island we found a place much like this, and in this place we found a book. [Eko unwraps the book and pushes it toward Locke.] I believe what's inside there will be of great value to you.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke opens the book. A square has been cut out, and inside is a piece of film. Locke takes it out and has a look at the strip. He sees frames with Marvin Candle.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack chopping wood, as Hurley approaches.]
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey. [Jack doesn't answer.] So, Rose's husband's white. Didn't see that one coming.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is there something you need, Hurley?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, just taking a walk, thought I'd say hey. -- Who's taking care of Sawyer?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sun is.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, you're like, mad at him?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] Why would I be mad at Sawyer?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Maybe because he's the one that always comes down here and chops wood, and now you are? It's like, transference.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What, are you a shrink now?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, that's what they call it in the mental hospital.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not mad at anyone.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun in the hatch with Sawyer. Kate enters.]
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where's Jack?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I don't know. He didn't come back.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Has he said anything?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Sawyer? No, he's still sleeping. Can you watch him? [Kate doesn't reply right away.] I can stay with...
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I -- I can.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Thanks. [Sun exits.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Kate entering a recruiting office. We see Sgt. Sam Austen on the phone at a desk.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSTEN	Right, uh-huh. Yes, I'm sure that's the exact one you have, uh-huh. I'll send one over to you, right. [He sees Kate.] I'll call you back later.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hi, Dad.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSTEN	Katie, the police and the U.S. Marshals are looking for you. You shouldn't have come here.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I've been waiting outside for 2 hours, they're not here.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSTEN	Is it true what they're saying? [Kate doesn't answer.] Katie, what'd you come here for?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSTEN	Tell you what?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I was making a scrapbook -- a surprise for your birthday. So I called one of your COs to get some pictures of you in uniform. The pictures that he sent me had dates on the back -- photos of you in Korea up until 4 months before I was born. Why didn't you tell me that Wayne was my father? Why?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSTEN	I didn't tell you because I knew you'd kill him. And your mother loved him. You were 5 years old. I wanted to take you along with me. She wouldn't let me.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So why didn't you kill him?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUSTEN	Because I don't have murder in my heart. I'm going to have to call them.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Can I have an hour?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He nods, and Kate hugs him.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Bye, Daddy.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Kate and Sawyer in the hatch.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Can you hear me? Sawyer? -- Wayne? [Sawyer stirs.] I'm probably crazy and this doesn't matter, but maybe you're in there somehow. But you asked me a question. You asked me why I -- why I did it. It wasn't because you drove my father away, or the way you looked at me, or because you beat her. It's because I hated that you were a part of me -- that I would never be good. That I would never have anything good. And every time that I look at Sawyer -- every time I feel something for him -- I see you, Wayne. It makes me sick.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's about the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who the hell's Wayne? [He opens his eyes.] I'm in a bunk-bed?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, you're in a bunk-bed.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Are we saved?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, Sawyer. Not yet.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko and Locke splicing the film together.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	VoilÃƒÂ . What are the odds?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	The odds?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah. -- Here, hold this down on the table there nice and flat. I mean, think about it. Somebody made this film. Someone else cut this piece out. We crash -- 2 halves of the same plane fall in different parts of the island -- you're over there, I'm over here. And now, here's the missing piece right back where it belongs. What are the odds?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Don't mistake coincidence for fate.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate helping Sawyer walk through the hatch.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You've got to be kidding me.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Air lock's over this way.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on, admit it, we've been rescued.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[exiting from the hatch door] You got it? Sorry. Watch yourself.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[seeing the jungle] Son of a bitch.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Watch yourself, okay?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[sitting down] Oh, got it.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Home sweet home.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I really thought you were yanking my chain. What do you keep smiling at?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You need a haircut.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, really? [Sawyer sees something in the distance.] Maybe you ought to take me back inside.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate turns to see the black horse.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You see that?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If you mean the big ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle, then yeah.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate approaches the horse and nuzzles it before it walks away.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Do you know that horse, Freckles?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I do.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana sitting on the beach making a sharp pointy stick as Jack approaches carrying little bottles of liquor.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Tequila and tonic, that's your drink, right?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Where's the tonic?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're running a little low on mixers.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	You sure you want to waste that on me?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Figured you could use a drink. I know I could.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Are you going to try to convince me that everyone here doesn't hate me?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Only if you're going to try to convince me that every woman in the world's not crazy.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko and Locke watching the Film as Michael checks out the computer hardware in the other room.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARVIN CANDLE	When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert [splice] utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer [splice] for anything else other than the entering of the code. This is its only function. The isolation that attends the duties associated with Station 3 may tempt you to try and utilize the computer for communication with the outside world. This is strictly forbidden. Attempting to use the computer in this manner will compromise the integrity of the project and, worse, could lead to another incident. I repeat, do not use the computer for anything other than entering the code. Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. [Locke stops the film.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael hears a bing sound. He looks at the timer which is at 51:00. He hears the bing sound again. He looks at the monitor which displays a word.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	Hello?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing, not talking] Hello?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	Who is this?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] This is Michael. Who is this?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	Dad?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael stares at the monitor and begins to mouth the word "Walt".]
