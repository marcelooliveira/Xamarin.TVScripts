6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie sleeping.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	[off camera] Over here. Jack!
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[off camera] Where's Jack? [Charlie approaches] We need the doctor.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	He's right there. Right there.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What happened?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke walking into the caves carrying Claire.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	Jack!
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Doctor!
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Is she alive?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What happened?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is she alright?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[now carrying Claire] Where did you find her?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	About a mile north. We were looking for the dog.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Was she conscious?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	She collapsed in my arms.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Did she say anything?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Charlie, man! Is she injured?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Is she alright?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Everybody needs to back off, okay? Just give her some air. [Jack wipes Claire's brow with a cloth]. Claire, can you hear me? Wake up now. Hey, Claire, Claire. Wake up now. [Claire opens her eyes]. Hey.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire screams and scrambles away.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Claire? It's okay. It's okay.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire. You're safe.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Who are you? Who are you?! Who are you people?!
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of jungle, then of Claire at the caves]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I don't understand. I don't know any Ethan. I don't remember. I don't remember any of you. I don't remember any of this.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What do you remember?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Um, I was on a plane flying to LA from Sydney.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Claire, we were all on that plane. It crashed here -- on this Island. That was almost a month ago.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No, I'm, I'm due.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Your baby's fine. He's kicking, everything's normal. Okay?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Well, if it's been almost a month then why hasn't somebody come to get us?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack, Locke and Charlie looking around not knowing what to say, as Jin and Sun look on.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Ââ€žÃ«Å’â‚¬Ã¬Â²Â´ Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬Å Â¨ Ã¬ÂÂ¼Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬ÂÂ¼Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€šËœÃ«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬Â§â‚¬? [Subtitle: What do you think is going on?]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â â‚¬Ã«Ââ€ž Ã«ÂªÂ¨Ã«Â¥Â´ÃªÂ²Â Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Å¡â€. [Subtitle: I don't know.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã¬Å¾Â… ÃªÂ´Å“Ã¬Â°Â®Ã¬Ââ€žÃªÂ¹Å’? [Subtitle: Is she alright? The girl?]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â Å“ Ã¬Æ’ÂÃªÂ°ÂÃ¬â€”â€ ÃªÂ´Å“Ã¬Â°Â®Ã¬Ââ‚¬ ÃªÂ²Æ’ ÃªÂ°â„¢Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Å¡â€. [Subtitle: Yes, I think so.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢Â ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«Å â€? [Subtitle: And the baby?]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€¢Â ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«Ââ€ž Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã­â€¢ËœÃªÂ²Â Ã¬Â£Â . [Subtitle: I'm sure the baby is fine.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke and Boone.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You think she escaped?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You were right beside me, Boone, you know as much as I do.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Well, where did she come from? I mean, we were out pretty deep. Nothing's out there. [Locke gives a faint smile.] She didn't say anything at all about Ethan?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Apparently she doesn't even remember Ethan.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	The guy pretends to be one of us -- he drags her through the jungle for almost two weeks -- she doesn't remember him?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Apparently.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You think he's around?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I sure hope not.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Claire's journal]
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire, here's your journal. It might help. [Charlie sits down next to her.] And this is where you sleep. It's quite cozy, isn't it? When he -- Ethan -- when he took you away, he took me, too. The others came after us. They got me back, but you, you were gone.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Who is he, Ethan?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ethan? Ethan's the bad guy.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	So, we were together when...
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Why did he leave you?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning. You've had enough for one day.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Ah, I won't be sleeping.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, lucky for me. I'm not much of a sleeper myself. Finally, I'll have someone to stay up with.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	We're friends?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We hear the sound of someone snorting heroin.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	How's that feel, mate?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sodding fantastic.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Good, 'cause, uh, we're almost out.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	But we're not out yet. Carpe Diem, my friend.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Look, save your French for someone who appreciates it.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Latin, Tommy. It's Latin.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Well, is it Latin for I've got a pile of money so we can score vast quantities of illicit substances?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	I suppose you ought to clean up then. It's time to put you to work.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of girl in a bar.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	[off camera] Miss Lucy Heatherton, 22, and right in oh so many wonderful ways. Just graduated from Oxford, lives in Knightsbridge with her dear old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton who, my friend, is bloody loaded.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me, Tommy.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Ready to fall in love, Mr. Charlie Pace of the legendary rock band Drive Shaft?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Absolutely.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of money going into a Jukebox and You All Everybody being selected by Tommy. Charlie is with Lucy and other girls at her table.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Seriously, ladies. I demand you stop buying me more drinks. I'm a man of high moral standing. Your obvious plans to take me home and ravish me will not work, saucy sirens. I believe in monogamy. I will not be shared like a common curry.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Are we that obvious?
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Dreadfully. Call yourself ladies? Jane Austen would be ashamed. I personally...
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sound of the conversation goes down. Shot of Tommy watching.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - shot of the ocean pans to Sayid.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The girl is pregnant. Very pregnant. Are we supposed to believe that she escaped from him?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What are you getting at?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Ethan infiltrated us. Whoever he is and wherever he comes from, he's intelligent. Who's to say he didn't even send Claire?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You're off your head, mate! That-
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, calm down. That's a stretch, Sayid.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed actual amnesia and such a selective brand of it?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, it's rare. But she's been through a major trauma. It is possible that her memory reset to the crash.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And the chances of that memory returning?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know what? You boys talk about Claire all you want. I'm actually going to go spend some time with her. I get the impression she might still be a tad upset.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jin walking with his fishing net. Charlie comes running up.]
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oi, Jin. You heading back to the caves? Ã¬â€¢Ë†Ã«â€¦â€¢?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢Ë†Ã«â€¦â€¢.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Safety in numbers, right? Of course, you have no idea what I'm talking about. How nice it must be to not be involved in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn. It's quite beautiful, really. You take care of your wife. Everything else is someone else's problem. No need to be involved in the decision-making process. No tree-shaking behemoths, French transmissions, just sweet, bloody ignorance. You don't know how lucky you are, you know. Must be nice. You wake up and...
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Jin hear a whirring sound.]
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin gets pegged with a rock and collapses. Ethan walks up.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Charlie, I want her back.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What? I...
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	I want you to bring her back.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What did you do to her? [Charlie grabs a stick and tries to hit Ethan.] What did you do?!
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ethan grabs Charlie by the neck and lifts him up against a tree.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	You bring her here. If you don't, I'm going to kill one of them. And then, if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow, I'll kill another, and another, and another. One every day. [Letting him go] And Charlie, I'll kill you last.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ethan leaves.]
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie at the beach.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What do we do? We go out and we bloody kill him!
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Calm down, Charlie. We don't want the others to get upset and...
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Forget the others. He's out there right now, Locke.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I think he's right. The man threatens to kill one of us unless we bring him Claire, and what, we just wait for that to happen? We tracked him once before, we can track him again.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You both seem to have forgotten how that turned out. [to Jack] He bested you physically. [to Charlie] He hung you from a tree. Running into the jungle unarmed is not going to get the job done.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So what does get it done?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We circle the wagons, tell a select few about the threat. We post some sentries here and back at the caves.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Tell a select few? He does what he says he going to do and that blood's on our hands.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Okay, Jack, we tell everyone. But, you want to protect them, you need to start thinking defense.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We move everybody off the beach, back up into the caves.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What if Ethan isn't alone? What if he delivered his threat so that we would gather like sheep to the slaughter in a confined space where they can roll in and take us all in one fell swoop.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, John. Obviously, you have a plan. So, let's hear it.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sun ministering to Jin's wound.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«Ââ€žÃ«Å’â‚¬Ã¬Â²Â´ Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬Å Â¨ Ã¬ÂÂ¼Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬â€”Ë†Ã«Æ’ÂÃªÂµÂ¬Ã¬Å¡â€? [Subtitle: What do you think is going on?]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬Å Â¨ Ã¬ÂÂ¼Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬â€”Ë†Ã«Æ’ÂÃªÂµÂ¬? Ã«â€šÂ´ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€“Â»ÃªÂ²Å’ Ã¬â€¢Å’Ã¬â€¢â€ž? [Subtitle: What's going on? How would I know?]

252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Claire and Charlie.]
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	The others are avoiding me.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No one will talk to me. You know, it just feels like something is going on.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Anything coming back?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	After the crash, no. Some of this stuff's probably better forgotten anyway. [She closes her diary.]
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, I don't know about you, but the rest of us have been having a wonderful time. We even built a golf course.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You're sure there's nothing going on?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Absolutely.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Okay.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Lucy and Charlie walking in the door of Lucy's house.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	You're quite enamored with yourself, aren't you?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date and you want to appear demure, but, you know, if you want to invite me back for sex don't say tea, say sex.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Do you want tea, or not?
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'd love some.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Brilliant.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So where is the old man?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	I don't know. I think he's buying some paper company up in Slough.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, yeah? Do you two get on?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Dad's quite cool, actually. He was rather proud when I told him I was going on a date with a bona fide rock star.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie sizing up everything in the room while Lucy is making tea. Camera lingers on a cigarette case.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	[coming back in the room] It was Winston Churchill's. Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the empire. Hey, you should meet him.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Winston? No thanks. I heard he's quite moldy.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	My father. He's coming back tomorrow. You should come round for dinner.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'd love to.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Excellent.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie back on the Island. Shot of Jack sharpening a knife. Kate approaches.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You look hungry. [She throws him a fruit.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Locke told us what happened. Why do you think he wants her back?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Maybe it's time you use that key you've been wearing around your neck. There are 4 nine millimeters in the Marshal's case and-
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh-uh. No. I hand them out, someone hears something out in the jungle and gets scared, the chances of us shooting each other are much higher than of us shooting him.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We're beyond sharpening knives here, Jack.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I am not putting guns in untrained hands.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke, Boone and Sayid creating a perimeter trip wire signal.]
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Trip it!
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A bag of garbage falls making a warning sound.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Not bad.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	4 of these around the perimeter will do the job.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I have fires prepared at 20 meter intervals.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Excellent.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Some of the men have volunteered for sentry duty. I'm going to put them on rotating shifts.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'll take a shift.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Okay.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Absolutely, we're counting on you, Boone.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack and Charlie at the caves.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Maybe we should move her.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She's safer here.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What about the mountain? There could be another cave?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She's safer here, Charlie.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[yelling] Nobody's safe!
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's my fault he took her. I was responsible. I should have taken care of her. I should...
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, nothing's going to happen to her, okay?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, okay.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Charlie having dinner with Lucy and her dad, Frank.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Well, Charlie, I think my lovely daughter would agree that you're the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	My condolences, sir.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	I don't know if Lucy mentioned it to you, but I was in a band once myself, you know.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	They were called the Protestant Reformation.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Yes. Ouch. Dreadful, huh?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You gave it up then?
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Well, I was married, Lucy was on the way. Her mom, god rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying, but I was wanting to be more practical, responsible, I guess. You know, a man has to provide, take care of his family. A man has to think about the future.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	And, of course, your band was bloody awful.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Yes, there was that, too. Small detail. So, are you working on a new album, Charlie?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're in a bit of a hiatus right now. Liam, my brother, just had a daughter. So, you know, we're taking some time off. Quite a lot of time off, actually. It's been a year since we were together. I'm thinking of doing a solo project. Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch and there's been some problems with royalties. The fact of the matter is, sir, uh, I think that Drive Shaft might be dead.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of bar/pub.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	You took a sodding what?!
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	A job, Tom.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	A job doing what?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Selling copiers.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	You took a job selling copiers?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I like her.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	She's a moose.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Don't say that.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Are you off your bleeding chump, man? I've been getting you off on my skag for over a week now on spec. Spec means speculation.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yes, I know what speculation means.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	In this case, the speculation that you'll execute your end of the plan and steal something of value which I can, in turn, sell. And by the time the poor helpless bird realizes it's missing it never even occurs to her that rock star Charlie bloody Pace could be responsible for such larceny, and the bloody party continues.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Look, I -- I don't think Liam's coming back. I have to think about my future.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Your future?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Really?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yes.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	When do you start this job?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Monday.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOMMY	Today's Friday, isn't it? After a weekend without a fix, Monday should be bloody wonderful. Let's see how the future treats you then, hey, Charlie.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Boone, Locke, Sayid on sentry duty. Boone is falling asleep. One of the wires is tripped and a bag of garbage falls, waking Boone up. It's now daylight. Boone hears something and goes running after it.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Boone running after the sound. He falls and Vincent comes running and licks Boone's face.]
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[off camera] Over here -- through the tree line -- something tripped the alarm.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[seeing Boone and Vincent] I think we found another missing castaway.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear a woman scream and go running to the beach where there's a body in the sand.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What happened?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Is he alive?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Oh, god.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did he get past us?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie, Kate and Hurley at the beach.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I thought those guys had a full on perimeter set up?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Locke said it didn't matter -- he came in from the water.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You sure it wasn't an accident? I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	His neck was broken, both his arms, all the bones in his fingers.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, okay. Got it.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[entering] So, Steve drew the short straw.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, that was Scott.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a burial mound.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Scott Jackson worked for an internet company in Santa Cruz. He won a sales prize: two week Australian vacation, all expenses paid. He was a good guy. Sorry, I kept calling you Steve, man. Um, amen, I guess. I...
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEVERAL PEOPLE	Amen.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know how to end these.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Claire walking to the spring in the caves. Redshirts are staring.]
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[to Shannon] Hi. Why is everyone staring at me?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I'm not staring at you.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What's your name?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Shannon.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Shannon, you're staring.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You mean nobody's told you?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Told me what?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie walking in jungle.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[off camera at first] Why? Why did you lie to me?!
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, look...
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, what else didn't you tell me?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I just thought with your memory there wasn't anything you could do.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Nothing I could do? Why would you keep me in the dark, Charlie? I'm already in the dark.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry. I just wanted to take care of you.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I can take care of myself.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Charlie in a suit looking sick and sweaty.]
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Look at you. Charlie Pace, respectable businessman.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You didn't have to buy me this suit, Lucy.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Mmhm. And what did you intend on wearing for your first day of work?
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I have shirts... with buttons.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	You okay?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, just a bit nervous.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Don't be. Dad's put the fix in. He's already demanded they buy two copiers to boost your confidence.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie looking at the cigarette case.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	[off camera walking away] Have you memorized the manual?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Backwards and forwards.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Say something impressive.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Uh, the Heatherton C815 copy center's leading scan offerings combine the benefits of document capture with instant delivery anywhere, anytime.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Anywhere?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Anytime, baby.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	You've been on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. This is just some men who want to buy a silly copy machine. You're going to do great. I believe in you. Oh, almost forgot, wait here.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay. [He swipes the cigarette case.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Alright, now, I know you'll protest, but you simply can't be respected unless you have one of these. [She presents him with a briefcase.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, Lucy.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	You're welcome.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, well. I'm going to be late -- the bus.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	The bus? Are you daft? I'm driving you.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, no, Lucy. I'd rather you didn't.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	No argument. Have everything you need?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Then let's get you to work.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Boone sharpening a spear with a knife. Jack approaches Locke.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John, want to take a walk?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They walk away a bit.]
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you think happens after the sun sets tonight?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, if we don't bring Claire to him? Rhetorical, Jack. Same thing happens tonight as happened last night.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You think you can track him?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, I'm sorry?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie. Do you think you can pick up the trail?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Maybe, but I wouldn't.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wouldn't?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack, I'm not a cold man. I feel for the loss of one of our own, but nothing fundamental is changed. Wherever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf. He has the advantage. To him we're nothing more than a bunch of scared idiots with sharp sticks.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What if I told you I had a way to get the advantage back?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then I would ask: what way might that be, Jack?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Locke go to the gun case which Jack opens.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm guessing you know how to handle one of these?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack holds the gun out to Locke who then takes it apart and puts it back together.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie, Locke, Jack, Sayid at the caves.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are you insane?
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's the best chance we have, Charlie.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No bloody way!
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If you want to capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him. And the only way do that is by giving him what he wants.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You have no idea what you're talking about. This guy, he will kill all of you. You can't protect her...
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[entering] Charlie, I can talk for myself.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire, they want to use you as bait.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I don't remember Ethan. I don't remember what he did to me. But if I can help stop him from hurting anyone else, I have to do that.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm coming with you. You said there were 4 guns.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright, we should do this. Let's figure out a game plan. Alright, Sayid, you're the soldier. Locke, you're the hunter. . .
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Inside an office with people gathered around a table.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed of the C815 using one your technical manuals.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shots of Charlie fumbling around trying to get the copier to work; looking in the manual, getting more and more flustered, and finally puking on the copy machine.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Charlie. Shot of Locke and Jack.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Charlie's right.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	About what?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We have 4 guns, we should have 4 men.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack, Sawyer, Kate.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Help? Moi?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know how to handle a gun, or not?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, I know at least one polar bear that seems to think so. [Jack hands Sawyer a gun.] Where'd you get the hardware, Hoss?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I want to come.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry, we're out of guns. And no one goes out there unarmed.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How much ammo you got?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	100 rounds give or take.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All 9's, right? 9 millimeters -- the guns?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, why?
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because, if the lady wants to come... [Sawyer gets a gun out of his tent.] Lifted this off the Marshal back in the old days. Remember him, don't you? Surly guy, kind of square of jaw, carries a Sig 9.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I remember you shot him. And missed.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well, bygones. And hell, 5 guns are better than 4.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie watching the guys and Kate preparing to go.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He'll be surrounded at 5 points. Everyone will be in visual contact with you. Make sure you stay in the area I've shown you. And remember, guns are a measure of the last resort. We want him alive.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie watching them leave. Shot of cloudy sky. Shot of Claire standing in a clearing in the rain waiting for Ethan to come. We see Sayid up in a tree. Sawyer, Jack, and Locke hiding. Ethan enters and starts chasing Claire.]
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Ethan chasing Claire; Jack runs in and tackles Ethan, losing his gun. The others come to help as Jack and Ethan slug each other.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Over here! Over here! Jack's got him! Hold your fire. Don't shoot. We want him alive. Claire! [Locke runs over to her.] You alright?
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[running up with Kate following] Over here!
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Hey, hold your fire!
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Easy.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets up off of Ethan.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Winner by a knockout. Nice one, Doc. Now, maybe somebody can tell me just who or what this son-of-bitch is! [Ethan starts to get up, everybody points their gun at him.] Uh, uh, uh, jungle boy. Not even for one second.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ethan is suddenly shot in the chest 6 times. The camera pans to reveals Charlie as the shooter.]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie?!
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of the ocean. The rain has stopped. Jack sits down by Charlie.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why did you do it, Charlie?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Because he deserved to die.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He could have told us where he came from, what he wanted with Claire, why he...
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Do you really think he would have told us anything, Jack? I wasn't going to let that animal anywhere near her again. Ever.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Charlie knocking on Lucy's door. She opens it.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Lucy, I'm sorry. I've been having some problems. If I could just explain...
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Leave, Charlie.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Lucy, I made a mistake.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	You made a mistake? My father's sales manager comes here to my house to return a cigarette case that the EMTs pulled from your suit pocket at the bloody hospital, and it still smells of your sick.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[whispering] I didn't mean to.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Oh, you meant to, Charlie. You meant to from the start. You're a liar! I believed you and you lied! I thought you wanted to -- you said -- you selfish bastard!
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Lucy, if I can just explain.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	Tell me one thing, and don't you dare lie to me. I get why you pretended to like me. I understand why you stole, because you're a junkie. But I don't understand why you took the job. Why did you take the job, Charlie?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I guess I -- I wanted to be respectable. I wanted you to think that I could take care of you.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LUCY	You'll never take care of anyone.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She slams the door in his face.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Charlie back at the caves; Hurley with his headphones; Sun and Jin; Jack getting water; Shannon tending to Sayid's arm; Charlie alone when Claire walks up.]
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I remember peanut butter. Why do I remember peanut butter?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It was imaginary peanut butter, actually.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I don't know what happened to me. I'm scared. I want to trust you. Goodnight, Charlie.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Goodnight, Claire.
