6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer walks down the beach as castaways carry the remains of a ping-pong table]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ping-pong table? Where the hell did that come from?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jin found it when he was out looking for firewood. We made legs for it, paddles, now all we need is a ball.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Found it?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It must've landed in the jungle when the hatch exploded.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I thought the hatch collapsed.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, dude, all I know is the sky turned purple. After that I don't ask questions. Just make myself a salad and move on.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I can see that's working for you. Hey! You seen Kate around?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wow. She's not back yet? Hmm. [to the others] You guys find anything we could use as a ball?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BACKGROUND VOICE	No.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Paulo] Hey, that's my Guns and Ammo. Where the hell you get it?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	It was in the magazine stack. We share things now.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff. Stuff you all decided to have yourselves a little party with while you thought I was dead.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Listen, hillbilly, if you want it that bad, take it. [The magazine is moved to reveal a roll of DHARMA toilet paper on a stick]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just keep it. [walks away]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid, Kate, Locke and Rousseau walking through the jungle.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We need to eat.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Are we still on course?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're still heading north on a bearing of 3 0 5. Yes.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sensing a lack of confidence.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We've been walking for two days, following a compass bearing provided by the carvings on a stick!
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And?
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You really think we're just going to chance upon where The Others are?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't know what we're going to chance upon, Sayid, but my bearing is the only bearing we got.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm going to find some fruit, and then, John, we'll have a rational conversation regarding our next move.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke nods his head. Sayid goes off to pick fruit. He hears the rattles of a cowbell. He grabs his gun. He finds a cow in the jungle. A man whistles and the cow follows to a house with a barnyard. The man is revealed to be the man with the eyepatch.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You all looking for something like this? [holds up a whiffle ball]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Cool, the ball. [grabs for the ball, but Sawyer pulls back]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh-uh. We need to do a quick prid quo first. I know I've been gone a while, and you thought the General Store was having a "going-out-of-business" sale. But now I'm back. And I want what's mine.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Yeah, but it wasn't really yours to begin with.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	A, it was mine to begin with when I took it. B, who the hell are you? And C, because I'm fair, I'm going to let you play me for it.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Play ping pong?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's right, Avalanche. You bastards put up your best player. One game. And when I crush them, you all gotta bring me every piece of my stash back.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	If you lose?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't gonna lose, but if I do, tell you what, name it.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€ Å’Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã¬â€“Â´ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã«Â­ÂÃ«Å¾Ëœ?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Å¾Â ÃªÂ¹ÂÃ«Â§Å’, Ã«â€šÂ´ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã«â€šËœÃ¬Â¤â€˜Ã¬â€”Â Ã¬â€“ËœÃªÂ¸Â° Ã­â€¢Â´ Ã¬Â¤â€žÃªÂ²Å’. Ã«â€šËœÃ­â€¢Å“Ã­â€¦Å’ Ã¬Â¢â€¹Ã¬Ââ‚¬ Ã¬Æ’ÂÃªÂ°ÂÃ¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬Æ’ÂÃªÂ²Â¼Ã¬â€“Â´.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ooh, looks like crouching tiger and hidden dragon got something good. Lay it on me.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	No nicknames. If you lose, no nicknames for anyone for a week.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Nice!
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're on. Pick your player. I'll be back in an hour, then let the slaughter begin.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid is looking at the house through binoculars.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You sure it's completely isolated?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I've circled the house. Nothing but jungles surrounding it. Here. [hands binoculars to Locke]
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Does that dish still work?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A satellite dish of that size would have broadcasting capabilities for thousands of miles. Danielle, you once mentioned a radio tower. Is this it?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	I have never been here before.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The man in the house, you said you've seen him before?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	On a video feed from the Pearl Station.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So who is he?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Only one way to find out. We ask him. [hands Kate his gun]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's this for?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If I'm unarmed, he won't feel threatened. In case he is threatened, you cover me from here.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau starts to exit.]
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, where are you going?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	I have no interest in that man inside the house. I have survived on the island precisely by avoiding these types of encounters. I'll wait for you by the stream, for those of you who survive.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sayid is working as a chef. Arabic man approaches him.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARABIC MAN	Najeev. Najeev. [in Arabic] A man out front wants to see you.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid walks outside]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Did you cook this?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes, I did.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Wow, it is delicious. My name is Sami.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Najeev. Thank you.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Please sit. Sit. Where are you from, Najeev?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm Syrian.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Please. Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ™â€žÃ™â€¡ Ã™Å Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â®Ã™Å , Ã˜Â§Ã™â€ Ã˜Âª Ã™â€¦Ã˜Â¨Ã™Å Ã™â€  Ã˜Â¹Ã™â€žÃ™Å Ã™Æ’ Ã™Æ’Ã˜Â«Ã™Å Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â§Ã™â€ Ã™Æ’ Ã˜Â¹Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â§Ã™â€šÃ™Å  Ã™â€¦Ã˜Â«Ã™â€žÃ™Å . [Subtitle: You are as much as an Iraqi as I am, young man] [Literal translation: I swear, my brother, it's very clear to me that you're Iraqi like me.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you want from me?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	You're an excellent cook. And I, I have a restaurant. Much nicer than this place. Come take a look. If you like it, I will hire you at twice your pay here.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're offering a stranger a job because of a single meal?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	I'm offering you a job because we're outsiders here. And because, um, my chef just quit.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sayid is walking toward the house with his hands up. He notices a gray cat. A shot is fired and Sayid falls to the ground.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, he's been hit. He's been hit.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Not yet. Do you want to get shot too?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I didn't cross the line! We had a truce! This is my land! You said I could stay here!
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm not who you think I am! My name is Sayid Jarrah! I was on a plane that crashed here months ago!
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	A plane?!
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm unarmed, I swear!
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Stay right there!
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail comes out as Kate and Locke approach. Shots are fired.]
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Drop the rifle! Stop, right now. Back up. Back up. [picks up Mikhail's gun]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Sayid] Are you all right?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	You really did crash here?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Over 40 of us, yes.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'll go in first. Make sure it's ok.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Who are you?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	My name is Mikhail Bakunin and I am the last remaining member of the DHARMA Initiative.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Mikhail help Sayid into the house]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Watch your step.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Please. Sit. Here, let me... [looks at Sayid's gunshot wound]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You've had experience treating gunshot wounds?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I spent some time in Afghanistan. I had experience with field medicine in the Soviet Army. [to Kate] In the kitchen, on the top shelf there is a medical kit. Will you bring it please?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's alright, Kate.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate goes to the kitchen]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you get here?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I almost don't know where to begin.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why don't you begin with the DHARMA Initiative.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I grew up in Kiev and joined the Soviet Army. I was stationed at a listening post at Vladivostok. After the Cold War, after we lost the Cold War, my unit was decommissioned. I was dismissed from my life in the military. And after years of conducting unpleasant actions against our enemies, I found myself wanting to do something good. So I replied to a newspaper advertisement.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	An advertisement?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	'Would you like to save the world?' it read. That's how I met them, the Initiative. They're very secretive, very rich, very smart.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	So, when did you come to the island?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	11 years now. I like computers, communications equipment, being alone like a lighthouse keeper. So they put me in this station. They called it The Flame.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What is the purpose of the flame?
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	To communicate with the outside world, of course.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke walks past a computer, which reads, "READY TO PLAY? Y/N"]
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COMPUTER VOICE	Ready to play? Ready to play?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke pushes Y and it reveals a game of chess]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COMPUTER VOICE	Your move.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What happened to the DHARMA Initiative?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	They're all dead, of course. They foolishly initiated a war against The Hostiles, the purge they called it.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you survive this purge?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	By not participating in it. I told you, I like being alone.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And the hostiles allowed you to stay here?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	After it was over, four men appeared in the yard. They offered a truce. They said to imagine a line that extended all the way across the valley. As long as I did not cross it, I would be left alone. Then they took two cows and I never saw them again.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	They weren't interested in the satellite dish in the yard?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Why would they be? It hasn't functioned for years.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who are they, these Hostiles?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I do not know. But they were here a long time before we were. A very long time.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid screams as Mikhail takes out the bullet from his arm]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sayid is walking down the streets of Paris near the Eiffel Tower. He walks into Sami's restaurant and sees a group of men eating]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I am looking for Sami.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Sami!
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Najeev! I'm so glad you came. What do you think? It's a simple place. We have simple customers. [Amira walks through the door] Ah, here's my wife. She is in charge of the kitchen. Amira, come meet the chef.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid shakes Amira's hands and notices that it has burn marks all over it.]
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Pleasure to meet you.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A man grabs Sayid]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	[to Amira] Are you sure this is him?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMIRA	Yes.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Look, I do not know who you think I am--
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The men beat up Sayid as Amira watches. Sami kicks Sayid in the face.]
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back in the Flame on the island, Mikhail places the bloodied bullet on a plate. Sayid and Kate grimace. The gray cat scratches at a rug. Mikhail speaks to the cat in Russian and Sayid recognizes the name "Nadia".]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What did you just say?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I told Nadia to be polite because you are my guests.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nadia?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Mm hmm. After Nadia Comaneci, the greatest athlete the world has ever known. We have the same birthday. Excellent work if I say so myself.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Thank you, Mikhail
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Perhaps I can begin to earn your forgiveness by offering you some iced tea. I will also check on your friend.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke continues to play the game of chess on the computer. A screen pops up saying "CHECKMATE YOU LOSE." Mikhail walks in.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Ha! Don't waste your time. For ten years I have tried to defeat that game. But it was programmed by three grand masters. And it cheats.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hmm. Well, I've played a lot of computers and I'm pretty sure they don't know how to cheat. That's what makes being human so distinctly wonderful.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate bandages Sayid's arm]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's wrong?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It just doesn't make any sense. Why would they let him stay here with all this stuff, all this equipment?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Actually it makes perfect sense.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you talking about?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The reason they let him stay here is because he is not DHARMA. He is one of them.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He shot you and you just let him- Why are we still sitting here?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We are sitting here, Kate, because I am certain he is not alone.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The castaways are standing around the ping-pong table]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So, you really the number one draft pick, Grimace?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yep. Are we playing with the mercy rule?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Mercy rule?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, if I am like up 11-0 I, you know, automatically win.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're going to go up 11-0.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, any one of us.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sure, we can have a mercy rule.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wanna volley for serve?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Tell you what, you can be my guest.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[crowd cheers]
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Take him down, Hurley!
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	0 serving 0.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley easily gets a point on Sawyer. Crowd cheers.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yes!
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	1-Nothing
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back in the Flame, Mikhail brings Sayid and Kate ice tea.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I grow the tea myself. So pardon the sweetness.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Any tea is good tea.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You know how long it's been since we've seen ice?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I noticed a series of thick wires as I walked around the station.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	This is the hub. But they go around to various stations on the island.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And these cables, do any of them run into the ocean?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Yes. There is an underwater beacon that emits solar pings to help guide in the vessels.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	By vessels, you mean submarines.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Yes. The Initiative used it to bring us to the island. But I can only imagine that the Hostiles have either destroyed it or commandeered it by now.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That explains how they are able to get around my position and capture our sailboat.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	You have a sailboat?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Until we lost it to your Hostiles.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	That's very unfortunate.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Well, at least we were able to kill one of them.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Why are we continuing to play this little game when we all know it has moved to the next stage?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail throws the pitcher of ice tea against the wall and begins to attack Kate and Sayid. Sayid and Mikhail struggle, but Kate holds up Mikhail with the rifle. Locke comes out of the room with his gun drawn.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Get some rope.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sayid is chained to the floor in the stockroom. Sami walks in with a bag and a bowl of water.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Drink.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid frantically drinks the water.]
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	You were a torturer, were you not, in the Republican Guard? Do you not recognize one of your victims? Do you not recognize the woman you tortured? Do you not recognize my WIFE?!
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No I have never seen- You are confusing me with someone else.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Amira was arrested for harboring an enemy of the state. She was held for three months while she was questioned. Her arms bear the scars of those questions. So I assure you, Najeev, I am NOT confused.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	My name is not Najeev. I'm Sayid Jarrah. I was in the Republican Guard and, yes, I was an interrogator. But I have never seen your wife. Maybe she saw me at the same facility, but I do not know her. I can remember every face of every person I interrogated.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	She remembers your face. She remembers it so well that she recognized you from a mere glimpse as we walked by the restaurant where you worked!
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you want from me?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	I want you to admit what you did. And if you don't, you will leave this room in a bag.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - In the Flame, Kate, Sayid and Locke tie up an unconscious Mikhail.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How do you know he is not alone?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The horse is still saddled outside, and the stirrups are set for someone much shorter than this man.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You think the Others sent someone out here to keep him company?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I think they sent someone out here because they lost communication.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Maybe when the sky turned purple.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That would be my guess.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, if they sent somebody out here, they're hiding pretty good. I checked every nook and cranny of this place.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid pulls back the rug to reveal a door in the floor]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Not every nook and cranny, John.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sami walks into the storage room with a chair, a club and Amira at his side. Amira sits down on the chair.]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Are you ready to tell me the truth?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I have already told you the truth. [to Amira] I do not know you.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sami hits Sayid.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	You tortured her.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, I would never touch a woman. [Sami hits Sayid again] Do you think this will do any good? To make me confess to something I didn't do?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	My wife confessed to something she didn't do. She confessed when you poured a pan of boiling water all over her arms!
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No I did not-
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Admit it!
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sami hits Sayid again.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	Admit it!
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I can not admit to something I didn't do.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sami walks to get the club, but as he does Amira stops him.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMIRA	That is enough for today.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAMI	[to Sayid] Then I will see you tomorrow.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Kate and Sayid go into the room underneath the floor. They notice a DHARMA symbol that says "The Flame." Upstairs Locke watches the unconscious Mikhail as the computer in the other room talks.]
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COMPUTER VOICE	Your move.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Downstairs, Kate and Sayid notice a mysterious box on the wall.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What is it?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	C4. Explosive. The entire place is wired.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Upstairs, Locke walks toward the computer and resumes playing the chess game. Downstairs, Sayid finds a stack of DHARMA notebooks, one in particular that says "Operations Manual." Upstairs, Locke makes a move on the game and the words YOU WIN and CHECKMATE appear and music plays. The screen fades to fuzz as Dr. Candle appears.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. CANDLE	Manual override complete. For pallet drop enter 24. For station uplink enter 32. for mainland communication enter 38.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke enters 38.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. CANDLE	The satellite dish is inoperable. Communications are down. For sonar access enter 56.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke enters 56.]
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. CANDLE	Sonar is inoperable. Has there been an incursion of this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Locke is about the enter 77, Mikhail draws a knife to his throat.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Keep your voice low, and your hands in front of you.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Downstairs, Kate finds a rack of workman shirts. All of a sudden a woman jumps out at her and attacks her. They struggle for a bit. Sayid draws his rifle.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Stop right there. Put the gun on the ground, now.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks at the woman, who is Ms. Klugh, and punches her.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you doing?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's her! She was there! She was at the dock! She was there when we got kidnapped! She knows where Jack is!
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[draws his rifle again] Are there any more of you here?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She doesn't answer.]
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Let's take her upstairs. John, we're coming up! [Upstairs] John!
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Out here!
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside Mikhail has a gun to Locke, while Kate and Sayid have a gun to Ms. Klugh.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	This is simple. Send her over to me and I release him, and we all go our separate ways.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Don't listen to him. If he was going to kill me, I'd be dead already.

568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Looks like that last slam didn't cause any long-term damage to your forehead. And you got three points which is better than nothing.

582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Get bent, Hugo.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the Flame, Locke is at the computer. Kate is downstairs]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Ready to go, Locke?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Be there in a minute!
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. CANDLE	Has there be an incursion on this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, Sayid is walking with a gun to Mikhail.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Danielle! Danielle! Tell me something. Were you ever a member of the DHARMA Initiative? Or was everything you said a lie? Of course, I'm wasting my breath.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I was never a member. But everything else I told you was true. I moved into this station after the purge.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The purge? In which a group of scientists attacked your people?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Believe what you want, but that is what happened.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	Your friends, did he kill them?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No. They are collecting whatever is useful from the farmhouse. And now we have our ticket to where the Others live, where we will find your daughter, and Jack, and finally, perhaps, a way home.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	There is nothing you could do to me to make me lead you there.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I didn't say you were our ticket, did I? [He pulls out a map from his backpack] This is a map showing electrical and data cabling running from the Flame, here, to a place called the Barracks, here. It's comprised of houses and dormitories, with water and power large enough to accommodate an entire community. Sounds like a place well worth visiting, don't you think?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	There will come a time when your guard is down. And when it is, I will not hesitate a moment before killing you. You should know this before you--
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	He is making an excellent point. You have a map. Why keep him alive?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Amira walks into the storage room with a gray cat and sits in the chair]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMIRA	After my husband and I first arrived to Paris, I was afraid to ever leave our apartment. So I would stare out in the window into the alley, and I would see this cat looking for scraps. One day some children came into the alley and trapped him in a box. I watched them light firecrackers and drop them in the box. I could hear him howl from three stories above. So finally, I had a reason to leave my apartment. I rescued this cat and I brought him home. He sits with me when I read, sleeps with me, and he purrs. But, every once in a while, he will bite me or scratch me. He does this because sometimes he forgets that he is safe now. So I forgive him when he bites me, because I remember what it is like to never feel safe. And that is because of you. So today, I ask only one thing of you: I ask you now to show me the respect by acknowledging what you did to me. That it was you who questioned me, tortured me and that you remember me.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I remember you. I remember your face. Your face has haunted me ever since I left Iraq. [crying] I am sorry. I am so sorry for what I did to you. I am sorry.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMIRA	I forgive you. When my husband returns, I will tell I made a terrible mistake, that it was not you, and he will release you.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why? Why are you letting me go?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AMIRA	We are all capable of doing what those children did to this cat. But I will not do that. I will not be that.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Outside the Flame, Rousseau has a gun to Mikhail.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	We should kill him, Sayid. He already told us he would kill us.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No. He's my prisoner. I will decide his fate.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Locke come outside.]
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to Locke] I can see you didn't see anything worth taking.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Actually I just played that silly chess game again. And now [to Mikhail] I can see why you didn't want me to beat it.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Meaning what?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The farmhouse explodes, knocking them to the ground.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What have you done, John? That place was our one hope of communication with the outside world!
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The computer said that if there was an incursion of the station by the Hostiles, I should enter 77. So I entered 77.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We should go. If anyone is around this explosion's going to attract their attention.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group leaves as Sayid shines his light on the gray cat.]
