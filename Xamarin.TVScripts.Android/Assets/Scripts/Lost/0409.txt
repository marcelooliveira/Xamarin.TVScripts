4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sitting by the shore, Kate lowers the strap of her tank top to sponge herself with water. She sees Jack and waves at him. Jack waves back and keeps walking, holding his side. In a tent, he opens a suitcase holding the prescription medications.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You got a prescription for that?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate peeks in the tent.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. I wrote it myself.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You look terrible.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, thanks.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack takes some pills with water.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are those?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Antibiotics. I just got a... a stomach bug.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You should eat some crackers. Crackers always make me feel better.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack chuckles, and Kate chuckles.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why aren't they back from the boat yet, Jack?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, Sayid said the engine was down. My guess is they're trying to fix it and wondering why the hell they can't get in touch with us.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	And you're not worried?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. My gut says we're getting off this island.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I thought your gut was sick.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They laugh. They hear Vincent barking. A man shouts.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[Off-screen] Help! I need some help! Help!
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Kate run down to the shore. Vincent barks.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Help! I need help! I need some help down here!
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard has found a body washed up onshore. Juliet comes running too.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	The dog was barking. I didn't see him.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Jin and Daniel and Charlotte arrive at the scene. Jack, Bernard, Juliet and Jin hoist the body ashore. Jack turns the body over. It's a man with a small cut on his upper cheek and a larger one across his throat. Daniel and Charlotte look on apprehensively.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you know who this is?
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	He was on our boat. He's the doctor.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We're all gonna die.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the Barracks, Sawyer, Locke and Hurley sit around a table in heated deliberation.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Calm down, Chicken Little. The sky ain't falling just yet.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This is exactly what he wants--to fight amongst ourselves. You're making a big mistake, dude.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's his to make, Hugo. [To Sawyer] Let's get on with it.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Right... I'm attackin' Siberia.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A loaded board game of Risk sits on the table. Hurley holds Aaron in his arms. Sawyer and Hurley roll the dice, and then Sawyer laughs, picking off some of Hurley's pieces.]
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[laughs] Sorry.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Can't believe you're just giving him Australia. Australia's the key to the whole game.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Says you.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer rolls again.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, the military team from the freighter leads Alex, her hands bound and her eyes blindfolded.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Stop here. On your knees. Get on your knees.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He shoves Alex to the ground, then removes her blindfold. She's at the edge of the sonar fence, a numbered keypad before her.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Hey. Turn this thing off.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	P-please. There's a baby with them. Just promise you won't-
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy cocks a pistol at her head.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Turn the fence off.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She enters 1-6-2-3.]
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Okay. It's off.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear the woosh of the fence deactivating.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back in Ben's house in the Barracks, a black telephone rings in the room where the game of Risk is taking place. Hurley, Sawyer, Locke and Aaron turn their heads toward it. Locke gets up and picks up the phone. He hears a beep and an automated female voice.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE	[Over phone] Code 14-J. Code 14-J.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Who is it?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think it's for Ben.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In a different house, the one where Jack stayed, Ben plays the piano. Sawyer and Locke barge in.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What's "code 14-J"?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben's eyes go wide.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Where did you hear that?
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The phone rang. I picked it up. A voice kept repeating, "code 14-J."
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben jumps to his feet, opens up the piano bench, and extracts a shotgun. Sawyer steps back in threatened shock, going for his pistol. Before Sawyer can draw, Ben cocks the weapon and hands it to Sawyer.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We need to get to the other house. It's easier to fortify, and we'll have better position on the tree lines.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben rushes for the door.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you talking about?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	They're here.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben opens the front door and walks out.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Ben comes to consciousness, lying sprawled supine in cracked, dry beige earth. He's wearing a parka with an as-yet-unseen DHARMA Initiative logo patch on the right chest, and a "HALLIWAX" nameplate on the left. Some sort of mist dissipates around him. He sits up and scans the horizon. Brown earth and mountains. Not another living thing in sight - not even a plant. No footprints can be seen around him.]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUBTITLE	Sahara Desert
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben gets to his knees, and becomes sick, vomiting a little. A gash on his right arm leaves that part of the parka blood-soaked. Unsteadily, he gets to his feet and looks around. Ben hears the galloping of horses. He looks around. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Suddenly, two Bedouin men ride up, turning a corner around a low ridge of earth. The shout at each other. They both wield AK-47s. Ben raises his uninjured arm in salute. One Bedouin wears a red keffiyeh on his head, the other, a gray one.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Red speaks an unintelligible language and cocks and points his weapon at Ben.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, no, no, no. Wait.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Red and Gray talk to each other in Arabic.]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RED	[Unintelligible]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRAY	[In Arabic] Look around! He doesn't have any trail.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Red looks around and sees no trail in the sand.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RED	[In Arabic, agitated] Where did he come from? Fell from the sky?
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Wait. I can explain. D-do you speak English?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They do not answer. Ben tries different languages.]
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[In Arabic] Do you speak Arabic? [:Ã˜ÂªÃ˜ÂªÃ™Æ’Ã™â€žÃ™â€¦ Ã˜Â¨Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¹Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â¨Ã™Å Ã˜Å¸]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Still no reply.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[In Turkish] Do you speak Turkish? [:TÃƒÂ¼rkÃƒÂ§e biliyor musunuz?]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Red looks at Gray. Gray dismounts and moves toward Ben.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRAY	[In Arabic] Do not move! [:!Ã™â€¦Ã˜Â§ Ã˜ÂªÃ˜ÂªÃ˜Â­Ã˜Â±Ã™Æ’]
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Sure. Sure.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben unzips his parka. Gray pulls it off. Ben winces as the parka pulls his injured arm. Gray pats Ben down. Coming to his right pocket, he feels something hard. Gray motions to Ben to remove the thing by patting it with the barrel of his gun.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Ah. Okay. Okay, okay.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben smiles and waves innocently as he removes the object. A small metal cylinder. He holds it up. Red shakes his head uncomprehendingly.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Chuckling and gesturing] This...
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRAY	[To Red, in Arabic] What is this? [:Ã˜Â´Ã™â€ Ã™Ë† Ã™â€¡Ã˜Â°Ã˜Â§Ã˜Å¸]
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Red gestures "I don't know".]
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRAY	[To Ben, in Arabic] What is this? [:Ã˜Â´Ã™â€ Ã™Ë† Ã™â€¡Ã˜Â°Ã˜Â§Ã˜Å¸]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[With a press of his thumb, Ben telescopes the small cylinder into a baton and whirls around, hitting the off-guard Gray in the head. Before Red can react, Ben has twirled Gray's body around in front of him as a shield and commandeered his weapon to fire into the chest of Red. Red's horse takes off in the other direction as Red's body slips limply to the ground. Ben flips Gray to the ground and Gray puts his hands up.]
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRAY	Surrender! Surrender!
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Oh, so you do speak English.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben knocks Gray unconscious with the butt of the rifle. He tears off a piece of Red's keffiyeh to use as a makeshift tourniquet on his injured right arm, pulling it tight with his mouth. He mounts Gray's horse]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[to the horse] Yah!
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He rides off the way they came.]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Ben leads Sawyer and Locke across the grounds of the Barracks.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let me guess. "14-J" ain't the code for the pizza boy.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	It's an early warning system.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Warning for what?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Somebody tripped the panic switch at our security fence. That means one of my people's been captured.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They arrive at the front of Ben's house.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Shrugging] Five minutes.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, so much for our head start.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He turns to go inside the house.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hold up. If we're hunkerin' down, I gotta grab Frenchie and the kids.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Don't bother. They're safe. I sent Rousseau, Alex and Karl away yesterday.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Indignantly] Away where?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben remains silent.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'. I'll grab her.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer tosses the shotgun to Locke.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	There's no time!
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll make time.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke turns to go with Sawyer. Ben stops him.]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	It's very important that you survive what's about to happen here, John. So I need you to stay close to me.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And why would I do that?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me. You want to live? I'm your best chance.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the beach, the living doctor examines the dead one.]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	His throat was slit.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[No one speaks.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Know anything about that?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte stays silent.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	No. Uh, he was fine when I last saw him.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Which was when?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	When? "When" is kind of a relative term.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	We don't know anything about this.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Any luck fixing the sat phone?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Uh, yeah. Sorry, no. The, uh, the mic was... smashed up pretty good. Best-case scenario, we'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch. Beeps and boops.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, yeah, but you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	If I had some strips of ferrous metal, uh, a 9-volt battery clip and some ... wiring.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Great.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll show you where it is.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They go away, leaving Jack, Charlotte and Bernard.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Bernard, you got a second?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In Ben's house at the Barracks, Ben and Locke move furniture around to block doors and windows.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	These people who are coming - you're scared of 'em, aren't you?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's right, John. I am.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron cries. Hurley rounds the corner with the baby in his arms.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's going on?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben and Locke move a bookshelf, tipping it over, dumping its contents.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Get away from the window, Hugo.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He's not.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, Sawyer comes around to the front of a house to find a redshirt in a plaid shirt gathering firewood.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey! You see if Claire left her house this morning?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOUG	What's going on? Why do you have that? [Indicating Sawyer's pistol]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Shouting] Just get back inside and wait until--
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A gunshot explodes the air, hitting the redshirt. He falls backward, dropping the firewood. Sawyer steps back as red blood splatters across his beige shirt. He points his pistol toward the tree line and fires a few shots. Gunfire erupts from the treeline. Bullets ricochet off the swing-set, causing sparks. A female redshirt runs out of the house in the midst of the commotion.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYWER	[Shouting] Get back inside!
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A bullet cuts the woman down. Another man runs out to check on her.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Shouting] Get inside!
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[But too late - another gunshot, a third dead body. Sawyer fires another shot into the treeline. Machine gun fire erupts from the jungle. Dodging a hail of bullets, Sawyer makes a run for it. He briefly takes cover behind a picnic table, lifting it up as a shield. He gets up to fire at a man firing a machine gun from the jungle.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Shouting] Claire!
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer ducks down behind the picnic table again, then makes a dash toward Claire's house, bullets impacting all around him, the pickets of the short white wooden fence he's running along flying off ahead of him as he runs. He fires off a few more rounds before taking refuge behind a barbecue grill. From the trees, someone launches a rocket toward the Barracks. Sawyer sees where it's going and runs the last few yards toward Claire's house.]
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Claire!
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The rocket strikes the house, which explodes in a fireball and collapses. Sawyer dives and rolls. He gets up to see little left of the house.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	CLAIRE!
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Grizzled and dirty, and still wearing the red keffiyeh tourniquet, Ben steps into the open-air lobby of a busy Tunisian hotel. He steps up to the desk, where the attendant, a young woman in an orange headdress, has her back turned. Ben rings the bell. She turns around; her nametag gives her name. She speaks with an English accent.]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	Good afternoon, sir.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	Of course, sir. Is this your first time in Tunisia?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No. But it's been a while.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	Your name?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm actually a preferred guest. It should be under "Dean Moriarty."
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben hands her a passport. She looks through the register, then up at him in a bit of shock.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She hands him a key.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	May I help you with anything else?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes. Um, today's date is...
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	October 24th, sir.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Embarrassedly] 2005?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NARJISS	Yes, sir. 2005.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He shakes his head - "silly me" - and turns away.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Thank you.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Ben climbs the stairs, new footage playing on a television set attracts his attention. The footage, narrated by a female newscaster in Arabic, shows Sayid hounded by cameras as he tries to get into a car.]
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[On television] I just want to bury my wife in peace.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - In Ben's house in the Barracks, Hurley, holding a bawling Aaron, peers through a curtain at the smoldering wreckage that was once Claire's house. Locke and Ben stack a couch in front of the front door. Locke shouts and points at Ben.]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Right now, I need you to tell me what's going on.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I think the technical term is "shock and awe." They're trying to frighten me into surrendering.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, why did they stop shooting?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Was that Claire's house?! Claire was there!
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hugo, get the baby away from the window. Put him in the back room.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley goes. Ben reloads a pistol.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You said I need to survive this. Why?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because there's only one person that can help us now, and that's Jacob, and we have to go to him together.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What makes you think I can find him? I-I don't even know where the cabin is.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I know, but Hurley does.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, Sawyer shouts, searching for any trace of Claire as he goes through the wreckage.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Claire! Claire! Claire!
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He spots legs sprouting from under a blanket.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Claire!
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pulls the blanket away and examines her bloody face.]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Are you okay?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Coming to] Charlie?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He hoists her into his arms.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Where's Aaron? Where's Aaron?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He's with us. It's okay. We're gonna move now. Let's go.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside Ben's house, Hurley takes a laundry basket and sets it on Ben's bed, placing a pillow inside it to create a makeshift cradle for the baby. He sets the crying lad in it.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Screaming from outside] Open the front door!
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks out the window to see Sawyer running with Claire in his arms. He hastens to the front door and tries to move the couch away. He hears a weapon cock.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hugo, you don't want to do that.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, Sawyer rounds a corner and comes to the front door of Ben's house. He tries kicking it.]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Open the damn door!
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside, Hurley becomes determined.]
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Shouting from outside] Open the door! Open the damn door!
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The door pounds with a kicking sound. Hurley lifts a large ottoman and chucks it through the front window. Sawyer runs to it and deposits Claire inside, handing her to Hurley.]
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Careful.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer climbs inside.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is she all right?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke pulls the drapes shut. Sawyer crouches in a doorway, trying to catch his breath.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They just started shootin'. Why? Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Those people were murdered to make you angry, James. So you'd be more likely to come storming in here and throw me to the wolves.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs Ben by the lapel.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, what's wrong with that? Sounds like a great plan to me. [To Locke] What do you say, on three?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The doorbell rings. Ben is saved by the bell as everyone turns to look at the door. They all point their guns. Locke runs to the door.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Sing-song] I wouldn't if I were you.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Shut up!
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer peers through the drapes, pointing his pistol. He nods, then runs to the door and helps Locke move the couch and bookshelf away. Ben points his rifle, Locke cocks his pistol as Sawyer opens the door and pulls in the man standing outside. Sawyer slams the door shut again and points his pistol.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Miles?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who the hell let you out?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	The people who gave me this. [He shows a walkie-talkie.] They want to talk.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - An American military truck rolls through a dirt street, with an American soldier guarding it as he walks along behind. Arab women in black clothes and headscarves clutching their children line the edges of the street. More American soldiers follow. Behind them, a funeral procession on foot, with a wooden coffin being carried on the shoulders of pallbearers, all Arab men. Up on a balcony, a woman lifts her son up so he can watch the procession. A man in front carries a framed picture of the deceased. It's Nadia. The men in the procession chant the shahadah in Arabic. Women in the procession carrying a framed photograph sob. A white van with the word "Press" painted on the corner of its windshield pulls up.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUBTITLE	Tikrit, Iraq
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The van stops. Out of the driver's seat steps Ben Linus. He crosses the street, turns a corner, and goes up the stairs of a building, passing a man in a turban as he climbs the stairs through a chain link gate to the roof. He removes his sunglasses, scans the street below, and pulls out a camera and a telephoto lens, assembling them with a snap. He first focuses on a dark-skinned bald man enjoying coffee leaning up against a corner of a building as the funeral processing goes by. Snap. Snap, snap. Then Ben focuses on a pallbearer in a black Western suit. Snap. It's Sayid, who looks up directly into the camera as Ben takes the picture. Startled, Ben ducks, hides, then runs down the stairs, across the street, making a beeline for his van, but before he can get there he is tackled to the ground and mounted by his assailant in a black suit.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You vultures, you followed me to Tikrit? You spy on me?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid lifts his fist to pummel the paparazzo, then realizes who it is. He lifts Ben up by the collar.]
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you doing here?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid lifts Ben to standing, and leads Ben to a corner strewn with debris.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you get here?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I came across the Syrian border. It's really not as difficult as you might-
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you get off the island?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Your friend Desmond had a boat. Remember? The Elizabeth. I followed a heading to Fiji. Then I chartered a plane.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why now?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You remember the name Charles Widmore, don't you? The man who tried to convince the world that your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What does it have to do with me? With Nadia?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	There was a man at her procession. He goes by the name of Ishmael Bakir. He's one of Widmore's men.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben extracts a photograph from his pocket and shows it to Sayid. It looks like it's from an automated traffic camera. The man behind the wheel is the one Ben took photographs of from the rooftop moments earlier.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Bakir was last seen five days ago in Los Angeles, caught by a traffic camera, speeding away from the corner of La Brea and Santa Monica.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That's three blocks from where Nadia was killed.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben nods.]
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why would these people want to murder her?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I don't know. But they did.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid crumples the photo in his fist.]
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back in Ben's house, Sawyer pats down Miles while Locke interrogates him. Ben is in a corner, thinking quietly.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How many of 'em are there?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Maybe six. I'm not sure.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The hell you mean, you ain't sure? You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	They told me they were just security.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Security for what?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	[Indicates Ben] For him. Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, Miles, sounds like you're not gonna collect your 3.2 million dollars.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Just take it. [Hands over the radio]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Why would I talk to them?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Because they have a hostage.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, then they've badly miscalculated, 'cause every single one of my people is prepared to die in service to this island.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	It's your daughter!
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben looks, frightened. He takes the walkie-talkie.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	[Over walkie] Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's right.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	My name is Martin Keamy. I'm an employee of Charles Widmore.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Whispers to Locke] Who's Charles Widmore?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Later.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	I'd like you to go look out your east window so we can talk about this face-to-face.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben goes to the window, peeling back the drapes.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	To the left. You see me?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy stands outside on Ben's front lawn, just paces away.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yeah, I see you.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	All right, Mr. Linus, these are my terms: You're gonna step out the front door, put your hands above your head, and you're gonna walk straight to me. Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you that no one else in that house will be harmed.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You and I both know that once you have me, there's nothing to stop you from killing everybody else on this island.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	[Smiling] What kind of guy do you think I am?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Martin Christopher Keamy - former first sergeant, United States Marine Corps, served with distinction from 1996 to 2001, but since then, you've worked with a number of mercenary organizations, specifically in Uganda. So I know exactly what kind of man you are, Mr. Keamy, and we can dispense with the formalities.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Okay, Ben. You got it.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy whistles. Another man in fatigues pushes Alex forward.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Get down.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy pushes Alex to her knees.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	[To Ben] Get your ass out here right now... or I'm gonna kill your daughter.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben thinks.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'd like to present a counterproposal.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	I'm listening.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You and your friends... you turn around. Walk back to your helicopter. You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Tell your daddy goodbye.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He hands Alex the walkie-talkie]
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	[Sobbing] Dad... they're serious. They killed Karl and my mother.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Alex... I have this under control. Everything's gonna be okay.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Please, daddy! Just please, please...
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	You have 10 seconds, Ben.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Okay, listen.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Nine...
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	She's not my daughter.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Eight...
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She's a pawn, nothing more. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it-
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A muffled gunshot interrupts Ben. Alex falls to the ground, limp, Keamy standing over her, his gun pointed down where her head was. Ben is shocked, dumbfounded. Keamy steps away.]
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Alex's dead body lays in the foreground, Claire's house burning in the background. Still looking out from the window, Ben stares in horror. Sawyer paces.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't see 'em. They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They won't be gone for long. It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes, and then they're gonna come for him.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Then let's just hand him over.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't think these people have any intentions of letting us walk out of here alive, James, no matter what we do.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He changed the rules.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke approaches Ben. Ben gets up and walks past him. Locke closes the curtains.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What? Who? What rules?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Whispers to Locke] You know I'm right.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben bolts.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Locke turn to see Ben pulling aside a bookshelf to reveal his secret room.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey! Where you goin'?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer chases, but too late. Ben vanishes inside, triggers a switch, and a steel security door comes down over the opening. Sawyer pounds.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Open this damn door! Open up!
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside, Ben pulls aside a rack of suits and removes a false wall to disclose an ancient stone portal with ancient markings. The thick door gives to his body weight as Ben pushes inside.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A calm Tikrit cafe. Ben sips a cup of pale tea at the counter, eyeing Bakir, who sits outside reading a newspaper, through the cafe's large mirror. Bakir gets up. Ben abandons his beverage and follows. He looks around through the streets, and gives chase through a crowded marketplace, pushing aside shoppers and a beaded curtain, finding himself in an empty alleyway. Suddenly, Ben feels a gun at his back.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BAKIR	Walk.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bakir frisks Ben, pushing him into a corner.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BAKIR	Who are you and why are you following me?
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	My name is Benjamin Linus...
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The name seems to mean something to Bakir, who lowers his gun slightly.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	...and I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BAKIR	And what message is that?
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A silenced gunshot, and Bakir falls forward, dead, revealing Sayid behind him with a gun. Sayid turns the gun down, away from Ben, toward Bakir. Another shot, and another, and another, and another, and another, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That should do it.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben walks away.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Wait. Where do you think you're going?
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We're finished here, Sayid. Turn around and walk away. Mourn your loss. Get on with your life.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben turns to leave again.]
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I have no life. They took it from me.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Go home, Sayid. Once you let your grief become anger, it will never go away. I speak from experience. This is my war. It's not yours.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben tries to leave once more, by Sayid catches him.]
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I spent the last eight years of my life searching for the woman I love. I finally found her and I married her. And I buried her yesterday. So don't tell me this is not my war. Benjamin... Who's next?
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'll be in touch.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben walks away. As he does, the corners of his mouth curl upward.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back in Ben's house, Sawyer pounds on the closed outer secret door.]
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Open the damn door! Son of a bitch just left us here. Open the damn door!
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley emerges with Claire, who's carrying Aaron.]
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What's going on?
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Claire?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You all right, sweetheart?
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The secret door slides up, and Ben emerges, pushing past Sawyer.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Excuse me, James.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	'Scuse you?
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben picks up the walkie-talkie from the couch and pockets it.]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What were you doing in there?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Okay, listen to me very carefully: I need all of you to do exactly as I say. In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can. At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head straight for the tree line.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You mean towards the guys with guns?
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, we want to be as far away from them as possible.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The house starts to shake. An earthquake? Glass shatters. Ben peers out the window. A giant billowing centipede of smoke barrels out of the tree line like a freight train bound for hell, lightning arcing inside the black smoke. It roars and chitters and sweeps up a little tail of smoke behind it as it passes Ben's house.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Okay, outside. Outside now!
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Ben, Sawyer, Hurley, Claire, and Aaron rush outside. Ben leads and watches as the muzzle flashes and lightning bolts light up the night in strobe. Gunfire can be heard, and shouting, and the terrible deep roar of the Monster. Black smoke curls and twists around in the jungle. Distantly, men shout orders in chaos.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What did you do?!
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben does not answer. A tree uproots.]
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did you just call that thing?!
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A man in fatigues carrying a machine gun runs toward the group. Sawyer readies to shoot him, but no need. The soldier kneels down and fires his weapon vainly into the smoke. The monster envelopes him and shoots a tentacle at him that knocks him to the ground, wraps around him, and drags him away, clawing at the turf, leaving his gun behind. The man disappears into the jungle screaming in terror. Miles looks on incredulously, then turns chicken and runs the opposite direction.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DISTANT VOICE	Fall back!
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Claire and Hurley] Go! Go, go!
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey, where are you going?
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben extends a hand. Locke hands him one of the shotguns he carries, then runs off. Ben solemnly staggers to the dead body of his daughter Alex, and turns her over. He kneels down and sobs, then kisses her tenderly on the forehead, which is streaked with blood.]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - On the table under the kitchen awning at the beach camp, Daniel taps on a jury-rigged telegraph key. Little electrical sparks inside the apparatus supplement the torchlight.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	I can't believe it. Might actually have a signal.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate smiles approvingly.]
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you sending?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	[Tapping] "What... happened... to... the... doctor?"
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dits and dahs come back in reply.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Okay. They didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor, but your friends are fine, and the helicopter's coming back in-in the morning.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Bernard] Well...
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	He's lying. What the message said was, "What are you talking about? The doctor is fine."
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	[Discomfited] You know Morse code.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What does that mean, "The doctor is fine"?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	I don't know.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why are you lying? Why did you say that the helicopters are coming back?
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs Daniel by the shirt.]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack!
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Were you ever... gonna take us off this island?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	...No. No, no.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks like he is about to cry, then doubles over in pain.]
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pushes Kate away and staggers off, clutching his lower side.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, at night, the survivors gather.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I think your chopper buddies ran that way, if you wanna catch up.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for-for now.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer hands Miles a torch. Locke and Sawyer draw their guns as footsteps approach. It's Ben.]
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sorry about your daughter.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Thank you, John.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That being said, you lied to me. You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hang on. "Jacob"? Who the hell's Jacob?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You know what? I'm done with all this. I never should have followed you wackos in the first place. I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid are comin' with me. [To Claire] You good with that?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron begins to cry.]
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, I'm good with that.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	I'm coming with you.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let's go. You too, Hurley.
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer takes off. Locke cocks his gun and points it at Sawyer. Sawyer stops in his tracks, exasperated.]
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Have you lost your mind?
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hugo stays with us.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer whips around and cocks his gun, pointing it at Locke. Locke doesn't shoot him. It's a Mexican standoff.]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Not a chance.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait. Leave me out of this.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sorry, Hugo. We need you to find the cabin.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He ain't goin' anywhere with you, you crazy son of a bitch.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Stop! Put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hugo.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's okay, Sawyer. [To Locke] Please, put your gun down.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke puts his down.]
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[To Sawyer] You, too.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You don't have to do this.
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer desists.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Locke] You harm so much as one hair on his curly head... I'll kill you.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Fair enough.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron starts crying.]
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let's go. Go. Move.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Miles, Claire and Aaron move off through the jungle.]
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Which way?
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Follow me.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A black taxicab pulls up to a curb on a city street. Ben steps out. He looks up at the building that is his destination.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUBTITLE	London, England.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Thank you.
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He hands payment to the cabbie, then, putting his hand into his coat pocket, walks through the gates of the building. Ben opens the doors and steps inside. A gray-coated doorman leans over a front desk. Ben walks right past the doorman. The doorman halts Ben with a few words.]
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOORMAN	Good evening, sir. May I help you?
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Whirling around] Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOORMAN	[Incredulous] At this hour, sir?
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Shrugging with his eyebrows] They're expecting me. [Challenging] Feel free to call up.
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben smiles. In his hands, behind his back, he clutches the closed baton we saw him use on the Bedouins in Tunisia. As he is speaking, he moves the baton further outward, as if in cautious preparation for opposition to his plan to go upstairs.]
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOORMAN	No need, sir. Good night, sir.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben, hiding the baton deeper into his hand again, turns and heads toward the elevator. He steps in, and the door closes on him. He pulls off his black gloves and inserts a lockpick into the lock next to the P button: Penthouse Suite. It lights up, and the elevator begins moving. With a ding, Ben steps out of the elevator into the darkened penthouse. He steps into a bedroom.]
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Wake up, Charles.
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charles Widmore pulls on a bedside lamp.]
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	I wondered when you were gonna show up. I see you've been getting more sun.
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Iraq is lovely this time of year. When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	When the nightmares started.
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore pulls back the covers and pours himself a glass of MacCutcheon.]
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore sips the whiskey.]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We both know I can't do that.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Then why are you here?
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm here, Charles, because you murdered my daughter.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Don't stand there, looking at me with those horrible eyes of yours and lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me, when we both know very well I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin - you did.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, that's not true.
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Yes, Benjamin, it is. You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night - like a rat - and have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore leans forward.]
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	I know who you are, boy. What you are. I know that everything you have you took from me. So... once again I ask you: Why are you here?
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm here, Charles, to tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter. Penelope, is it? And once she's gone... once she's dead... then you'll understand how I feel. And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore shifts in his bed.]
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	You'll never find her.
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben turns to leave.]
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	That island's mine, Benjamin. It always was. It will be again.
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Turning] But you'll never find it.
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I suppose it is. Sleep tight, Charles.
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben leaves, pulling the door shut behind him.]
