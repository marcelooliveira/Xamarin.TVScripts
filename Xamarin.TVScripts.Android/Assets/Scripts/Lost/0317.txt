Catch-22
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Jeff Pinkner & Brian K. Vaughan
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Stephen Williams
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, Desmond leads a team of Charlie, Hurley and Jin through the rain and undergrowth.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You're insane mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by The Flash.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Er, for charity. And Flash would totally win cause he can like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Sarcastic] Oohh vibration, whatever would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, no smashing allowed.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No flying, no smashing, any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite...
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie steps on a wire.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	The hell?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He lifts his foot off, causing a trap to swing in motion. A crossbow in a tree fires as a mechanism. The arrow pierces Charlie's neck straight through.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Charlie!
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	ÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã«Â§Å’Ã­Å¾Ë† Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´!
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Don't, don't touch it.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Just breathe, just breathe huh.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie chokes.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Don't try to talk mate. We've gotta get back.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No, you help!
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I can't help! [To Charlie] I'm sorry mate.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie continues to choke and then stops moving. Other images suddenly flash before Desmond. Hurley pulling out the cable from the sand.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, here it is.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A red light in the sky at night. The picture of Desmond and Penny. An image of Jin, Hurley and Charlie holding a tarp as a net.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Superman, can fly around the entire planet...
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[An image of Penny looking at Desmond.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the beach, Desmond opens his eyes. The entire event has been some sort of flash or vision. He pauses by the shore, looks at Charlie, and then runs to Hurley.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey. Where's the wire?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	D'you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Listen to me, there's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. Do you know what I'm talking about?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This is future crap isn't it?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	The cable, do you know where it is?! This is important.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees the red light in the dark sky, feet hanging from trees. The group holding the tarp.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Superman can...
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The photo of Penny and Desmond.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[To Hurley] Because someone's coming.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Desmond is in a monastery, reading from the Bible. He puts down the book as a monk enters. He hands Desmond clothes, religious garb.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	God tests our faith in many ways. So, as you well know, we have our own test here. A vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fit. This challenges both one's patience, and his faith. For some, it may last a week. Those we are less sure about, a month. Personally, Desmond, I never thought you'd last. And so now I stand corrected. For whatever reason, your path has led you here. And now you're one of us. Welcome, brother.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Thank you, brother.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They smile.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At the beach, Desmond and Hurley approach Jack.]
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Morning, Jack. Must be nice to wake up in your own bed.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yep, home sweet home.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Listen I was wondering if I could borrow your first-aid kit. Er, twisted my ankle.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You want me to take a look at it?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Nah you're alright. I've taped my fair share of ankles.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Right.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs the kit and gives it to Desmond.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Thanks.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack notices Hurley staring out into space.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Something wrong Hurley?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nah, uh uh, just, keeping Desmond here company. Cause, we're friends.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Desmond] Bring that back when you're done with it, OK?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Absolutely.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They walk away.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What the hell was that? Do you want him to get suspicious?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Suspicious of what? Oh this is like when you knew Claire was drowning isn't it? That's why you got the first-aid kit, someone's gonna get hurt. Is it me?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No. It's just a precaution.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, dude. You want me to take you to the wire, I want an explanation.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I saw a sequence of events. Things that are gonna happen.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What'd you see?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It was, it was like a sorta jigsaw puzzle. Only I didn't have the picture in the box so, I dunno how the pieces fit exactly but, but one of the pieces, the first one...
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees the image of Hurley picking up the cable in the sand.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	... It was you, pulling the cable out the sand.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So what are the other pieces?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	If I tell you that, it'll change the picture in the box.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So what? Isn't that the point? Preventing something bad?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Not this time.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So you're not trying to stop something from happening, you actually want it to happen.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees himself and Penny posing for their photograph, of him wiping Penny's tear at the stadium, of her kissing him in their flat.]
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	More than anything.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Further down the beach, Sawyer goes to Kate's tent, and stands outside.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey Freckles, you home?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thought you weren't allowed to use nicknames.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, you weren't around when I lost the bet, so you're-
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer enters the tent to see Kate getting dressed.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	... Exempt.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks at Sawyer as he ogles.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's up?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh, I wanted to ask you something.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yep.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate notices Sawyer ogling her breasts.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm up here.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh ... so did you tell him?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Did I tell who what?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You know, did you tell the Doc? About you and me.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No. But he knows. He saw us on one of those surveillance monitors.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I thought you said the camera was broken?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well they had another camera.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Mumbles] Perverts.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Anyway, he knows.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well now that, that's out the way, maybe a little afternoon delight.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate doesn't look impressed.]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It means sex.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I know.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate pushes Sawyer out of her tent and walks away.]
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on, Freckles, wait, now look, you need me to make ya a mix tape?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah why don't you do that.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond and Hurley watch Jin preparing to fish.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, you're gonna have to tell me again. What do we need Jin for?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Because he was there with us.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	On the beach, when I find the cable.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond flashes to see Hurley lifting the cable, and Jin helping him do so.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[In the flash] Here it is!
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[To Hurley] That's right.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	In one of your puzzle flashes.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	That'd be the long and short of it. But I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Watch the master.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley walks toward Jin.]
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Camping?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, you know, like sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach. Marshmallows.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Nodding] Camping.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He stands thinking.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Yes.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[To Desmond] Everybody likes marshmallows.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[To Jin] Good man. Get food, water.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He walks away.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Where are you going?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We need one more.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sits speaking to Charlie.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	How daft do you think I am? This isn't a camping trip. You've had another one of your visions haven't you? What was it this time?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Someone's coming to the Island.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Coming? As in someone whose not already here, how the hell is that gonna happen?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Can't tell ya.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's got nothing to do with me?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well you're a part of it, yeah. As are Jin and Hurley.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right, but with all due respect, you haven't previously told Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond flashes to see the arrow shoot at Charlie and go through his neck.]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well that's not gonna happen. Not this time.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Pauses] Can I bring my guitar?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Smiles] Absolutely.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Alright I'm in. You had me worried there for a second.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time later, the foursome are whistling while they trek down the beach.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This is it.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	But, how can you tell?
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Where is it then?
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin finds the wire under the sand.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬ÂÂ´ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬Â§â‚¬?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Way to go, dude!
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley pulls up the cable.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Here it is!
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond flashes to see Hurley repeating the phrase. He then sees the red light in the darkened sky, along with inaudible words from Hurley.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Just one thing, last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabed by one of Rousseau's spiky death-trap things.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond flashes to see Charlie getting hit by the arrow, as well as a chute falling from the trees.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[In flash] Cut her down!
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We're not going in the jungle, well not yet. It's getting late, so we'll, er, we'll camp here the night.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Smiles] Camp.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin and Hurley go to set up.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So when do they get here? Your mysterious someone.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Soon.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Desmond and the monk stand labeling bottles of wine]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	You do realize you are free to talk again, Brother Desmond.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Used to being quiet I suppose.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He looks at the "Moriah Vineyards" label]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Moriah. I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here, interesting.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	And why is that brother?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well, Moriah's the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac. Its not exactly the most, festive locale is it.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	And yet God spared Isaac.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well one might argue then, God may not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Well then it wouldn't have been much of a test, would it brother? Perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another monk enters.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK 2	Brother Desmond. Brother Desmond. I met this man waiting at the gates, he says he needs to have a word with you.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man punches Desmond in the face, then gestures the sign of the cross with his hands.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[To monk] Sorry, sir.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man leaves, and the monk looks at Desmond.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Forgive me, brother.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At camp, its night as Kate is eating some food. Jack arrives.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The oatmeal's awesome.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It is huh.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's strange huh.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's that?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Being back, not, looking for a way out of a cage not, finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again, I almost don't know what to do with myself.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well enjoy it, I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate laughs.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well my big dangerous adventure for tonight is gonna be doing the dishes, in the ocean.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Be careful.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll try.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Erm, can I borrow that spoon.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate licks it clean as she passes it to him.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks. Goodnight.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah goodnight.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate grabs the dishes. As she goes, she sees Jack sat eating with Juliet, laughing and chatting. She goes to Sawyer's tent.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What my doorbell busted again? What the hell are you doing?
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gets on top of him.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Shut up and don't talk.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She kisses him.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You crying?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I said shut up.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She continues.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got it.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He lifts her up and they continue kissing. Kate unzips her pants.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the cable, Charlie and Hurley are listening to Jin.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[speaking in a high pitched voice to mimic that of presumably a child] 'Ã­â€¢ËœÃ«Å ÂÃ«â€¹Ëœ, ÃªÂ°ÂÃ¬â€šÂ¬Ã­â€¢Â©Ã«â€¹Ë†Ã«â€¹Â¤.

404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley screams and they all laugh. Desmond stands away looking at his photograph of him and Penny.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, I love the part about the bird. It was a bird right?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[To Hurley] You.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Me? OK erm, have you heard the one about the Chupacabra..
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Chupa...?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, like a bear with spines...
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Their conversation becomes inaudible as Charlie goes to give Desmond a drink.]
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Thanks.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie notices the photograph.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Who's that?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond gives Charlie the photograph.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Her name's Penny.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That's not bad, Des. Not bad at all. So how did you manage to leave her behind and come here?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Because I'm a coward.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You and me both pal. You know I tried to run away from her and she, she tracked me down. With enough money and determination you can find anyone, she said. And I used to wake up in nights, thinking if she actually meant it, that she never gave up, then maybe she's spent the last three years looking for me.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As they sit, the chopping sound of a propeller can be heard.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's that?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is that a helicopter?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Rescue!
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As they watch, the sound begins to change to that of grinding metal.]
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Er, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sounds change again, the engines seem to be struggling, the propeller dies out. A crash in the ocean signifies that the vehicle has crashed into the sea.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We gotta go out there.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Out there?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well yeah.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	In what?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well we gotta do something.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Look.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He points to the sea. A small red light flickers in the darkened sky, and heads inland over the Island.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh my god.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group rush around discussing what to do next.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Pallet.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nah dude, it's not a food drop, you saw the beacon thing, someone like ejected.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah but that was a helicopter, you can't eject from a helicopter.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well maybe they jumped. All that matters is that they're here.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	They, how do we even know its a person?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Gestures towards Desmond] Cause he said someone was coming.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie sees Desmond packing a bag.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Where you going?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Out to where it fell. Come on let's go.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, whoa, slow down. We're not gonna trudge out into the jungle in the middle of the night.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Yes we are.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death-trap? Now it going to be light in two hours, we'll wait until then.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	She can't wait.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	She?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	They. Whoever it is, could be hurt. We have to go all four of us now.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Because that's the way its supposed to happen.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right well I guess its supposed to happen without me.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees flashes of the photo of him and Penny, Charlie stepping on Rousseau's trap, the arrow piercing his neck, a flight crew gas mask, a pilot falling from the trees.]
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Pauses] We'll leave at first light then. Together.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Terrific.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Desmond knocks on a door in a suburban street. The man who punched him earlier opens it.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Is your sister in?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Leave. Now.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Let him be, Derek.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Derek goes inside.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hello, Ruth.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside, she and Desmond drink tea.]
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RUTH	So you're a monk now are ya?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well technically I'm still what they call a novice, 'til the abbey...
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RUTH	[Interrupting] Why are you here Desmond?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well now that my initiation's done, I felt like I owed you an explanation.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RUTH	Desmond. You can never begin to explain what you did. You left one week before the wedding, everything was planned bought and paid for. You just disappeared completely.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I had a calling.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RUTH	We dated for six years, and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	OK, yes, I was scared about the wedding, so I had a few pints too many, maybe I, I raised my eyes, and I asked am I doing the right thing, and that's the last thing I remember. And when I woke up, I was lying on my back in the street, and I dunno how I got there and, there was this man standing over me, Ruth. And he reached out his hand and he said to me, can I help you brother. And the first thing I noticed was the rope tied round his waist, and I looked at him and I knew, I knew, I was supposed to go with him. I was supposed to go with him, I was supposed to leave everything that mattered behind, sacrifice all of it, for a greater calling.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RUTH	Well its a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up, or as I suppose you'd be off with the sheep wouldn't you? Next time you want to break up with someone, Des, don't join a monastery. Just tell the girl you're too bloody scared.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At the beach, Juliet is working on her tent with Jack.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You a doctor or a carpenter?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What your dad never taught you to use a hammer?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No my dad taught me how to drink.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh at least it's something.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer enters.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hope I'm not interrupting. You two arguing over who's your favourite Other?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you want Sawyer?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well what I wanted Doc was to inform you there's been some developments since you were AWOL. So tell me...
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He holds up some table ping-pong bats.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	...How's your backhand?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time later, Jack and Sawyer are playing ping pong.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So where'd you get the table?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't you recognize it? Fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo. We don't play every hundred and eight minutes, the Island's gonna explode!
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer wins the point.]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Finally, something I can beat you at.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know, considering I haven't played since I was 12, I wouldn't be too proud. What's that, 18th point?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's kinda strange huh? Being back.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack laughs.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Something funny?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Er, Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She did huh.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She did.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack plays on and Sawyer flinches.]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nineteenth point.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So you guys ate together, huh?
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, Juliet and I had dinner together last night.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Huh.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They play again, and Sawyer wins the point.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Best two out of three?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got it.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inland, Desmond leads Charlie, Hurley and Jin.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So what's next?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Next?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah you saw the wire, the flashy thing falling out of the sky. Now what? Maybe I can help you find--
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Interrupting] That's it, there is no next. We find the beacon.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why you lying to me mate?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Look, mate. I've saved your life three times now. If that hasn't bought me your trust, I don't know what will. Let's move.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They continue on through the jungle.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, seriously I'm gonna have a coronary.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Actually you're not. And if you don't get a move on we're not gonna make it before nightfall-
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie picks up a hula doll.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Look at this.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬ÂÂ´ÃªÂ±Â´ Ã«Ââ€žÃ«Å’â‚¬Ã¬Â²Â´ Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€â€Ã¬â€žÅ“ Ã«â€šÅ“ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It can't be Rousseau's. If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees something in the trees.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Don't move.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He climbs on Hurley and uses him as a leg-up.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What are you doing? Ow. Ah, ahh!!!
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond pulls down a bag and tips out its contents.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did that come down with the flashing red light thingy?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond finds a copy of Joseph Heller's Catch-22, though it is in Portugeuse (Ardil-22). Jin finds another item.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Walkie-talkie!
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Taking it] No dude. That's a satellite phone.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He turns it on, but it quickly turns itself off.]
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Crap, it's dead.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Shocker.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the book, Desmond finds a copy of the photograph of him and Penny, being used as a bookmark.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh my god.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Is that you? And who is she?
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That would be Penny.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At camp, Kate is washing the back of her neck with water from the trough. Sawyer approaches, and hands her a cassette tape.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's this?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Your mixtape.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate laughs.]
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, you gonna take it or ain't ya?
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate does so.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The best of Phil Collins, huh?
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't get picky. And if Bernard asks, I don't know a thing about it.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thanks, James.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So why'd you jump me last night?
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Was it cause you saw the Doc hanging out with Juliet?
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It is not like that.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's not? You ain't gotta use me Freckles, all you gotta do is ask.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inland, a storm is rolling in as the team continue their trek.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You think it's her don't you?
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Who?
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Your girl. Penny. You think its actually her who bailed out the helicopter.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Earlier I hoped it. Now I know it.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why didn't you tell us?
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Would you come if I had?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Of course. Why wouldn't I?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I didn't wanna tell you because... I didn't want anything to change.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Fair enough. Look if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued, why would we want to change anything, right?
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Smiles] Right.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond flashes to see the arrow piercing Charlie's neck.]
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Mutters] Right.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Thunder sounds, and it begins to rain.]
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Thanks for the heads up about bringing an umbrella, dude.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Desmond sits in the monastery drinking the wine and singing]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Singing] Well its a grand old team to play for, and its a grand old team to see. And if you know your history, its...
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Brother Desmond. What are you doing?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well I believe I'm, getting pissed on our lovely wine.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	That bottle of our lovely wine fetches over a hundred quid. We've only bottled a hundred and eight cases this year.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well its just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then isn't it?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	We've also taken a vow of charity.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Right.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond takes another sip of wine and passes the bottle to the monk. He pushes it away.]
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Something tells me Desmond that you're not cut out to be a monk.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well ... ah, you know, I, I've had a tough week. I'm sorry for the wine. I'll take the penance.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	I'm afraid you're beyond penance, Desmond.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Brother Desmond.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Not any more.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Are you firing me?
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	I am indeed.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You can't do that, I heard the call.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	I'm sure you did hear the call, but the abbey clearly isn't where you were meant to end up. I have little doubt that God has different plans than you being a monk, Desmond. Bigger plans-
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh aye, I'm sure he does.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	He does! You've just spent too much time running away to realize what you may be running toward.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The monk moves to leave.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey. What am I supposed to do now?
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Whatever comes next.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - The group is still trekking through the rain.]
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Who's Penny?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	She's a chick Desmond used to date. And now he thinks she fell from the sky. So we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued... Dude, even if I spoke Korean it wouldn't make any sense.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking. She might be hurt.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm moving as fast as I can. In case you haven't noticed dude, I'm not exactly the Flash.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	The Flash is pathetic.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You got something against the fastest man alive?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You're insane, mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Sup woulda got dusted by the Flash.
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, for charity. And Flash would totally win cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Sarcastic] Oohh vibration, and what would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees the crossbow in the trees.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, no smashing allowed.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No flying, no smashing... any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite ballet slippers...
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie steps on the wire.]
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	The hell?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Ahh, Charlie, duck!
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond tackles Charlie to the floor, causing the arrow to hit his guitar over his shoulder rather than him.]
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group continue walking through the jungle.]
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	This way.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No, the beacon fell this side of the rise.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No, there.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How about we split up? Me and Charlie go that way, you and Jin go round, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there.
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Uh, you and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They split up, with Charlie following Desmond.]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You said "duck."
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Sorry.
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You shouted "duck." You knew, even before we set off. You knew all this time didn't you?
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well then why didn't you say anything?
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Because if I'd told you the truth you wouldn't have come!
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, and you needed me to come. Cause I was part of your vision. You thought that the only way you could get your girl back was if I took an arrow in the head. You would have sacrificed me!
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	If the flashes don't happen exactly how I saw them, the picture changes. I was supposed to let you die Charlie.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's that supposed to mean?
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It means it's bloody pointless. I keep saving your life, and what good has it done? Its just gonna keep happening again and again, maybe that's the point, eh? Maybe it's a test.
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Test?
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Like God, testing Abraham, except I failed, because I changed what I saw.
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â¹Â¨Ã«Â¦Â¬ Ã¬â„¢â‚¬, Ã¬Â°Â¾Ã¬â€¢ËœÃ¬â€“Â´!
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond and Charlie run over. They find a parachutist stuck in the trees, the parachute stuck in the branches.]
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Å¡Â°Ã«Â¦Â¬ Ã­â€¢ËœÃ«Å â€ Ã«Â§Â Ã«â€œÂ¤Ã«Â Â¤Ã¬Å¡â€?
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! Hey, can you hear me?!
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Hello! ÃªÂ´Å“Ã¬Â°Â®Ã¬â€¢â€ž?
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, she's not moving.
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Desmond enters the monk's office holding his religious clothes.]
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	I was afraid you'd let without saying goodbye.
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He lays the clothes down.]
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I nearly took this with me.
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond heads to leave.]
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	If you're not in a hurry, Brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours; he can give you a ride. That is, if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting.
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond laughs.]
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, Desmond wheels cases of the vineyard wine to a car, as the monk chats with a woman]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	All 10 cases are ready to go. Desmond there is just getting the last one.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Thank you, and my father sent the check in advance.
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Please thank him for his generous donation. Always a pleasure to see you.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The monk leaves, shaking Desmond's hand as he goes.]
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONK	Goodbye Desmond.
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond carries some of the crates round to the back of the car. He sees Penny and though they are meeting for the first time, he looks at her in awe.]
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	I think we should be able to fit it all in the back, and if not we'll put the rest in the front. [She turns and looks at Desmond] Is that alright?
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Absolutely.
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The scene begins to overlap with Desmond climbing the tree to release the caught parachutist.]
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You better drive safe, Miss. This vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year.
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Is that so?
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye, it's cause the monks are lazy.
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Penny laughs.]
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Yeah, its easier making grape jelly than wine.
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	And how do you know so much about monks?
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Cause I'm an ex-monk.
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Really?
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	As of last night. I was fired.
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Penny laughs again.]
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh, it wasn't that funny.
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	I'm sorry, I never, I, I didn't know monks could be fired.
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh they can. You know I was told under no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up. Just a, step along a path. You know, 'God allegedly has bigger plans for me.'
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the Island, Desmond cuts free the chute, and the others catch it.]
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Something tells me you don't entirely believe that.
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I suggest that's because I don't.
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Well, maybe they're right. I mean, just think, if you hadn't have got fired, we wouldn't have met, and then, how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle.
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Not yet.
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the Island, Charlie, Hurley and Jin spread out the chute as a net to catch the parachutist. Desmond cuts the strings, and the person drops into the chute.]
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	I mean, of course if an ex-monk already has plans, then...
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You know I don't usually get into cars with strangers.
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Well in that case I'm Penelope. [Pauses] Penny.
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Desmond. Very nice to meet you, Penny.
948	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They smile and laugh.]
950	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - The scene now switches back to the Island fully. The parachutist stirs.]
952	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	She's alive!
954	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond rushes toward them.]
956	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Stand back! Get away from her! I'm here, I'm here, Penny.
