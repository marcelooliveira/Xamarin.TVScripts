2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Stephen Williams
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki runs frantically through the jungle. She grabs something out of her bag, and buries it in the dirt quickly, before getting up shakily to resume running.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Nikki steps down the stairs in a strip club, wearing a white jacket and hat.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANNOUNCER	And now, dancing on stage three, the pride of Saint Paul, Corvette!
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki pole dances, stripping off her jacket. She notices a man in a suit enter a back room. She follows him into the room, entering to find the man opening a case full of money, and another man in a purple hat facing CCTV feeds.]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	No! That's the money for the orphanage. That means, Mr. LaShade, you're the Cobra.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BILLY DEE	Sorry, baby, it's just business.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	All this time it was you.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BILLY DEE	Pretty and smart. What a shame.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He looks to the other man, who attacks Nikki. She kicks the gun out of his hand and karate chops him in the neck.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Razzle-dazzle! Ha!
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She bends down and grabs the gun, but "LaShade" pulls out another gun and shoots her three times. She collapses. He gets up and shoots her again. Two other strippers enter and see Nikki's body.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BILLY DEE	Autumn, Crystal, bad news. Corvette was working for the Cobra. But fear not: he will pay.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	And, cut!
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A man with a clipboard signals the scene's end. Production crew rush around. Nikki lifts herself up.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BILLY DEE	Oh, let me give you a hand. [helps Nikki up]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Oh, thank you. Billy Dee, it was so great working with you.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BILLY DEE	Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine; thank you so much.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You're sweet.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BILLY DEE	Take care.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You too.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki heads over to meet the director, Howard L. Zukerman.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Alright, that's a series wrap for Corvette! Let's hear it for Nikki!
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Most of the production crew clap and whistle.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Thank you.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Brilliant, Nikki. As always. You know, you don't need to die. We can bring you back next season.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[laughs] How?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Well, let's say that, uh, Corvette was wearing a bullet-proof vest?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki pulls away her jacket to remind Zukerman that she is wearing nothing but a bikini underneath.]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Bullet-proof breast!
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[covering back up] Look, I'm just a guest star, and we all know what happens to guest stars.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Now that your work's done here, I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney and heading back to LA.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They step off-set to look at Sydney Harbour.]
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	No, I'm not leaving Sydney. I love you.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	I love you too.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They smile and kiss.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Hurley and Sawyer are playing table tennis. Hurley wins the point.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son of a bitch! Alright, come on, let's go one more.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You said best out of five.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, now we're going best of seven.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly someone approaches from the jungle. It's Nikki, who stumbles onto the beach looking dazed.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ah.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, you OK?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki falls to the ground, struggling to breathe. Hurley rushes over, and Sawyer follows.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What happened?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[struggling for breath] Pa... lies...
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The hell's she saying?!
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I dunno.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let's get her some water! Get help!
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer gets up and moves toward the jungle, peering through the trees to see where Nikki came from. As Hurley watches, Nikki stops moving. Sawyer turns around and sees Hurley sitting there.]
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What are you doing?! Get moving!
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude... Nikki's dead.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	... Who the hell's Nikki?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 84 days ago, Nikki sits in Zukerman's house eating breakfast with him.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Mmm. Howie, the frittata is amazing.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Hm hm! My new chef; he's fantastic. Paulo, come in here.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	[walking in with a bread basket] Yes, sir?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan. I'd like you to meet Nikki.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	The food is amazing.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	You're too kind. The secret is the shaved truffles. Luckily for you, they are in season.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[in a mock whisper] You know, you should ask for a raise.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo chuckles, and Nikki bursts into laughter.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Excuse me. [walks away]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	He just came to Sydney. Heard I was hiring, and showed up at my office every day until I gave him the job. Apparently, back home, he's the, um, "Wolfgang Puck of Brazil".
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Wow.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	[grabs the bread basket] Here. Try one of these home-made rolls. [Nikki laughs] Please, please do.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki takes a slice, revealing a diamond bracelet underneath.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Oh, it's... beautiful. Howie, you shouldn't have!
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZUKERMAN	[laughs as Nikki puts the bracelet on] I realize, of course, it's not a ring. Not yet. But, uh, when my wife--
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki looks up from admiring the bracelet as Zukerman abruptly stops. Zukerman suddenly starts to choke and grab his chest.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[standing up, urgently] Paulo..! Paulo!
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo hurries in. Both stand over Zukerman as he moans, then stops moving. Paulo checks his pulse.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	He's gone.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki moves to touch him softly, but instead pulls open his shirt and grabs a key on a necklace he's wearing. She snaps the necklace off of Zukerman.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[scornfully] I would have loved it if you could have figured out a way where I didn't have to eat the same food as him.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They move to a walk-in closet and find a safe.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	So nobody else knows about this thing?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Everything in here is way off the books.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki puts the key in the safe and starts to open it. Paulo pulls out a cigarette and prepares to light up, but Nikki grabs it out of his mouth.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Ashes are evidence, Paulo. We poisoned him; let's not poison ourselves.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo reluctantly snaps his lighter shut. Nikki opens the safe and pulls out a Matryoshka doll. She opens three layers of dolls to get to the core. Nikki and Paulo smile down at it.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Razzle-frickin'-dazzle.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Nikki's body is lying on the beach, as the survivors assess the situation.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What happened?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We dunno. She's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite, nothing.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Maybe it was something she ate.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Maybe she was poisoned.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	We should check the food supply to see if anyone else is sick.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[checking Nikki's limp hands] She's got gunk. Under her fingernails. [to Sawyer] Where'd you find her?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Right here. She stumbled out of the jungle, face-planted, said something like "plywood", and... and, sayonara.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Actually, I think she said "power lines."
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, who the hell knows what she said - she was five seconds from dying. Probably seeing a light at the end of the tunnel-
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[interrupts Sawyer with a shout] "Paulo lies!" That's what she said! "Paulo lies," not "power lines." "Paulo lies."
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who the hell's Paulo?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Paulo's her... husband, or... boyfriend, or... whatever. They lived down the beach.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, where the hell is he? 'Cause if he lies, that might be a good place to start.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 80 days ago. Paulo looks at a newspaper article on Howey's death as he and Nikki sit in Sydney Airport.]
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	English ex-pat, Howard L. Zuckerman, the creative force behind such hit shows as ExposÃƒÂ©, Strike Team Alpha and Dr. Kincaid Esquire, was found dead in his palatial Sydney estate from heart failure.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both laugh, and Paulo kisses Nikki.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Are you chewing gum?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo opens his bag, inside is the Matryoshka doll. He pulls out a pack of nicotine gum.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Nicotine gum. I quit.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They pick up champagne glasses.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	A toast. To our new life together.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Cheers.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Behind them, two people arrive.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	There's nowhere to sit. No tables, no chairs, nothing. Good call, Boone.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Do you wanna just grab a chair from the restaurant?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	No, forget it, let's just leave. You already screwed us out of seats in first class, why would you be able to find them here?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[To Paulo and Nikki] Hey, can I have this chair please?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Yeah. Be my guest.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone, let's just go!
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Thanks anyway.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both walk away.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone!
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm coming, Shannon.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	If you quit flirting with random guys, maybe you could actually get on the plane.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Promise me we'll never end up like them.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	I promise.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss again]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AIRPORT PA	Paging Captain Stewart, please pick up the courtesy call Captain Stewart.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The scene moves to the beach, but still in flashback. Its the moments following the crash. Shannon screams at the top of her lungs. Jin shouts for Sun, as Nikki appears in the background]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	BOONE!!! BOONE!!! BOONE!!!
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki rushes past, seeing Jack with Claire, Boone with Rose. She then sees Locke helping carry a man. Locke turns to another man near the turbine]
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey, hey, get away from there! [To Nikki] Hey, get back, get down. Get away from there!!!
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man is pulled into the turbine, causing it to explode. Nikki carries on walking, and sees a man lying face down]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Paulo! Paulo!
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She turns him over, to find it is not Paulo. It's Leslie Arzt.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Are we alive? Did we survive? Look at me, am I OK? Am I OK?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[Runs up to Nikki] Hey. Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen? [Runs off] Hey does anybody have a pen?!
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki finally sees Paulo looking out at sea with shocked eyes]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Paulo. Paulo, are you OK?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Yeah. I think so.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Baby look at me. Look at me.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo does so.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Where's the bag?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What?
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	The bag, Paulo, where is it?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo looks shocked.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Sawyer, Hurley and Jin can be heard approaching Paulo's body in the jungle.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm telling ya, this is the trail.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What do you know about tracking?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well I know what a footprint is.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Over here.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They find his body]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wow.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm guessing that's Paulo.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He's just like Nikki, no wound, nothing.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬Â¹Å“ÃªÂµÂ¬ Ã¬ËœÂ·Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬â„¢Å“ Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å¾Ëœ?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah I know.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer sees one of Paulo's shoes stuck in a tree]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why are his pants undone? And why's his shoe in that tree?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Maybe he stepped on something.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks out into the jungle as Jin opens Paulo's bag]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You see something? Sawyer?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nothing.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin uncaps Paulo's bottle of water]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No! Don't.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pours all the liquid out]
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, what are you doing?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Two people are dead - you ever think they mighta been poisoned?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's evidence. You're messing up the crime scene.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Crime scene? There a forensics hatch I don't know about?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	STOP! Monster.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 75 days ago. At night, Nikki and Paulo look through some of the unclaimed luggage.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	How many times do I have to tell you, there's no such thing as monsters.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Maybe it was a dinosaur.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Its not Jurassic Park, Paulo, its the South Pacific.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Then what was it? You saw the trees move.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Would you start focusing? We've been here for six days, OK, the coastguard is gonna get here any second, and I really don't think that they're gonna take "hey, you know what, I'm looking for my script bag" as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	OK, OK, OK.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Hey. You guys lose your luggage? Yeah I lost mine too. I found some other stuff though, so if you need anything, pants or sweatshirt, I can help you find some that fit. I'm Ethan, by the way.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Hi, I'm Nikki, and this is Paulo.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Nikki.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Hi.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Paulo.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	And you are so sweet Ethan, but actually we're not looking for clothes. Yeah, see, Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Ouch. You might have more luck looking inland.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	In the jungle?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	The plane split apart when it was over the Island [Possibly says "Islands"], so some of the stuff might have rained down in there.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Commotion can be heard, and Arzt runs past.]
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Boone. Boone took the water.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Many survivors chatter.]
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What is going on?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Someone had to take responsibility for it, it would have never lasted!
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group start to fight, Sayid holds back Charlie.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Leave him alone! Its been six days, we're all still waiting for someone to come. We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. Now I found water. Fresh water up in the valley. I'll take in a group at first light. If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute. Because every man for himself is not gonna work. But if we can't live together, we're gonna die alone.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - The group have brought Paulo's body back to the beach to keep it with Nikki.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm with Jin. It's the Monster.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah because that makes the most sense.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It does. Locke said when Eko died, his last words were "You're next." And Nikki and Paulo were with them. He was talking about them.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He wasn't saying you're next about them, he was saying you're next as in you're all next.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah that's not really better.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alright, so here's how I see it. We wanna know what happened, we gotta find out whatever we can about these jabronis.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Jabronis?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nina and Pablo.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, show some respect. You know their names, its Nikki and Paulo.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Whatever, Hugo. Where's their tent? And we better get some shovels.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 57 days ago. Nikki wanders the beach and goes to Arzt's tent, where he is examing bottles with insects inside them.]
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Hey Dr. Arzt.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Oh hi.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You're a scientist, right?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	And an educator, yes.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	What are you doing with all this stuff?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Oh, erm well, since we've been on here, I've discovered 20 new species. I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki picks up a glass.]
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Ah, ah, that is a Latrodectus regina. Very dangerous. They call her the medusa spider. Her pheromones are very strong, one whiff and every male of the species would be here in seconds. Not unlike you I guess.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	So, you're probably too busy to help me then.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	No, no, not at all, I'm fine, er, I can help you, what can I do ya for?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Well I'm trying to find my luggage, and since the plane broke apart over the jungle, I was wondering if you knew about trajectories and stuff.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	[Laughs] Do I, do I know about trajectories? Allow me to draw you a map, madam.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki looks to see Paulo watching her.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Later, they trek through the jungle together carrying the map.]
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Are you sure we should be listening to a high school science teacher?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Junior high, and yes. What's your problem with Leslie anyway?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Leslie?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Oh ho, you're jealous!
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Of him? Ha, never.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Yeah, his spiders turn me on so much, I had to sleep with him to get the map.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	I wouldn't be surprised. You slept with Zuckerman.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki stops walking.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	I did that for us.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She continues walking.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	OK I'm sorry, I just, I don't trust that guy. We should have gone to Ethan, he would have helped.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Paulo, look.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both look up to see the smugglers' plane dangling over the cliff edge, caught in the vines.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Another plane. Looks like its been here a while.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Go up there, maybe there's a radio or some-
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Are you insane? If I go up there that thing's gonna fall.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You're not gonna fall.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What? You want me to die? [Pause] Come on. Let's keep going.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They carry on, walking over soil.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	What's that?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo looks to see hatch doors poorly covered in dirt. They uncover it and try the doors.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	OK, let's do it.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They pull the doors open to reveal a deep drop and a ladder by the side.]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Let's check it out.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Wow. So our carry-on bag fell from the sky, opened a manhole, crawled inside and closed the doors behind itself? You don't wanna climb up to a plane, but now you wanna climb down a ladder into a dark tunnel. I don't think so.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki shuts one of the doors and walks off]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Sawyer rummages through Nikki and Paulo's tent as Hurley watches.]
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, man, be careful.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why? They don't live here any more.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So Sun checked the food. They were eating the same as us and no one else is sick. Could it be a virus?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, Monster. [Looks over] Creepy, they collected bugs.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah, I think these were Arzt's. Collected all kinds of creepy crawlies before he, exploded.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	They must have been friends.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie pulls out a script-book]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	ExposÃƒÂ©.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did you just say ExposÃƒÂ©?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell's ExposÃƒÂ©?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Only of the most awesome hour of television ever. It's like "Baywatch" only better. Its about Autumn and Crystal, two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their swarve smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How'd I miss that one?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Check it out, look at the cast list, Nikki Fernandez. That's gotta be why she was in Australia. This must have been her big break.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well it certainly sounds like it.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No way. Mr. LaShade was the Cobra?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is that supposed to mean something?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude the Cobra's this big bad guy. His identity's been shrouded in mystery for four seasons.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer finds a walkie in Paulo's luggage, and turns it on.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	They had a walkie talkie?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Every damn one of those bastards on the other side of the Island had one exactly like this hanging from their belts.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll tell ya how. They were working with the Others.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 48 days ago. Shannon and Arzt stand arguing with Kate as Paulo and Nikki approaches]
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What gives you the right?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You have to understand, we thought it was best for everybody.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	I'm sorry, you my mother? Cause she knows what's best for me - other than that, I decide.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki and Paulo walk over.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Hey, what's going on?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Kate and her two boyfriends found a case of guns that fell out of the plane, but they decided they didn't really need to tell the camp.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Look. The case is locked. The key is around Jack's neck, alright. I promise you they're safe.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	You're all out of control. The pigs are walking. [Shouts] Huh, the pigs are walking!
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both Shannon and Arzt leave.]
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[to Kate] So, where did you say you found that case?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the waterfall, Nikki and Paulo stand discussing.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Its just water, Paulo. Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Why me?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Well as you had no trouble reminding me, I slept with Howie Zuckerman. So the least you could do is go for a swim, and Kate said they found the case on the bottom.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Lemme ask you something.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	What?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	If you didn't need me to find that bag, would we still be together?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	That bag is worth eight million dollars. Just dive in, Paulo.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo does so, and finds the bag between some rocks. He resurfaces.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Well?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Nothing.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	There's nothing down there?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Just dead bodies.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki leaves, and Paulo goes underwater once more.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - The survivors stand over Nikki and Paulo's bodies.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	OK, so they had a walkie talkie. You think they were working with the Others, like how?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Like Michael.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	If that's the case, then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who knows why those people do anything? What matters is they could be out there right now waiting to get us.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I dunno, dude. I was with the Others, like, two weeks ago, they're on a total other side of the Island.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Then who dragged me into the jungle? [Charlie and Sawyer glance at each other.] The Others came into our camp, they grabbed me, put a bag over my head. And if I hadn't gotten away, they would have killed me.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look y'all stay here. [Pulls out a gun] Lemme see if I can see any sign of 'em. I'll do a perimeter sweep.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Where'd you get the gun?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Got it off one of them.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And when were you gonna let us know?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I guess right now.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer leaves.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What exactly is a perimeter sweep?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Shakes his head] Hey shouldn't we cover them up?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes, of course.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		Flashback - 32 days ago. At night, Paulo is on the beach digging through his carry-on bag that he found in the waterfall earlier. He opens and chews some nicotine gum before beginning to bury the Matryoshka doll in the sand.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nice night.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo is caught by surprise and hides the doll.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What you doing?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Nothing.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It looks like you're digging a hole. Every man's entitled to his secrets Paulo, but can I give ya a piece of advice?
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Please, John.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You should put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Why is that?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Things don't stay buried on this Island. The beach is eroding. Winter's coming, high tide. Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure you pick a spot that won't wash away. See you back at camp.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo looks at the doll, thinking.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time later, Paulo enters the Pearl station with a flashlight and investigates. He finds a toilet, and hides the Matryoshka doll in the plumbing behind it. Before he can leave, he hears voices and hides.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who left this open?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Tom was down here a couple of days ago.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Have him cover it up with the plane.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben and Juliet enter the main room and turn on one of the monitors, revealing the Swan station with Jack in the shot.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	That him? Shephard?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He's cute. Why are we doing this? Shephard will never agree to do the surgery.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, I can convince him to do it.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	How?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Same way I get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, and I exploit it.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	So, what? We just grab all three of them, Ford and Austen too?
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No they need to come to us.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	And how do we make that happen?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Michael, of course.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Are we done here? This place gives me the creeps.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben turns off the monitor and they leave, shutting off the lights too. Paulo creeps out of his hiding place, and finds a walkie on the table.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Hurley rushes over to the food tent.]
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! Desmond! You hear about what happened to Nikki and Paulo?
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye. Tragic.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, do you know anything?
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How'd you mean?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Can you, you know use your psychic powers?
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Doesn't work like that. I only see flashes.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No offense dude, but as far as superpowers go, yours is kinda lame. Thanks anyway.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I do know that she was with your mate this morning.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	My mate?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I saw her with your boy Sawyer. The dead girl, Nikki.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He said he didn't know her.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Then why was she yelling at him?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yelling?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	At Sawyer, this morning?
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Right before she died.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Further down the beach, where Paulo and Nikki bodies are lying, Vincent pulls away the blankets covering them.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Vincent! Dude!
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fighting. That doesn't prove anything.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look at the facts, and ask yourself. Why is Sawyer so gung-ho about investigating this? What's in it for him? He pretended he didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with Nikki.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Sawyer's not a murderer. He went all the way across the Island to help Michael. It is the Others, I know what they can do.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	OK, you know what, I'll go get Desmond. He'll tell you exactly what he saw.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley leaves.]
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sun. It was me.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What?
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It was me who took you, not the Others. I wasn't myself. After Locke hit me. After he humiliated me. Sawyer told me I could get even by helping him steal the guns, we just made it look like, the Others. I didn't mean to hurt you.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun walks away with a tear in her eye.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Mutters] Sorry.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 9 days ago. Locke, Sayid and Desmond approach a group of survivors, including Nikki and Paulo]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station, there's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody wanna come along?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[Raises her hand] I'll go.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Great.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes, and bring water.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	You're not serious.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the Pearl, the group try to fix the monitors. Meanwhile, Paulo sneaks into the side room to retrieve the doll.]
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Hey guys. What are these other TVs for?
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sorry?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	All these TVs. This guy says that there's six stations, [inaudible]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The Pearl Orientation video is replayed with Nikki pointing out the pluralized form "projects." Paulo retrieves the bag of diamonds and flushes the toilet before entering the main room. The rest of them turn from the sound of the toilet.]
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	The, toilet still works.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group shrugs off the interruption.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - The survivors are busy digging Nikki and Paulo's graves. Sawyer approaches.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Give me the gun.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The hell you talking about?
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Give it to me.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pulls out the clip.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ain't even loaded.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Then how are you sweeping the perimeter? Quit lying dude. Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki this morning.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh I see what this is. Villagers have got themselves some torches.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did you kill them?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No. No I didn't kill them. Yeah, me and Nikki went at it this morning. Cause she wanted a gun.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why didn't you tell us this before?
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Cause of the dirt under her nails.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She was digging. And when we found him I saw a fresh mound of dirt. She was burying something. And if you take the time to dig a hole right before you die, then what your hiding's probably pretty damn good.
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	So what was it? What did she hide?
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer throws Sun a pouch. She sprinkles out the contents onto her hands. Diamonds.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Go ahead, take 'em. Cause whatever happened to those two, I had nothing to do with it.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer walks away.]
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 12 hours ago. Nikki sits on the beach, and Paulo joins her.]
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Did you know Thanksgiving was two weeks ago?
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo shakes his head.]
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	We missed it, Paulo, just like we're gonna miss everything.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	They're going to find us. We'll get rescued. You'll see.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[Laughs] OK where did this sudden burst of optimism come from?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	I dunno, I guess, it's how we look at things. Like the bag. I mean, maybe not finding it was good for us.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	How do you figure that?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Look what it did. It might have torn us apart.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Yeah.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both smile.]
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Wait here. I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[Smiles] OK.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss briefly. As Paulo leaves, Nikki notices something on the sand. Nicotine gum, which was in the same bag as the doll.]
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki goes to see Sawyer.]
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	OK, I know you have them. Give me a gun.
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't have the guns. A-team took 'em all.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Right, except for the ones you kept for yourself.
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Even if I had a gun I wouldn't give it to you. Judging by the fire you're breathing, I got a feeling no good would come of it.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Sawyer, give me a gun.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Across the beach, Desmond notices the two arguing.]
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I got a better idea, sister. How about you go stick your head in the ocean and cool yourself off?
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Thanks for nothing.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She leaves. Sawyer shouts after her.]
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And who the hell are you?!
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Sawyer goes over to Nikki's body.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Whispers] Thanks for nothing.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He closes her eyes and begins to dig. Sun approaches him.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Charlie told me it was your idea. To kidnap me.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Sighs] You gonna tell Jin?
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	No.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why not?
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Because then we'd have to dig another grave.
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun takes Sawyer's hand and gives him back the diamonds.]
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why are you giving me these?
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Because they're worthless here.
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	See, and I thought I was going to get out of this without a lesson-
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun slaps Sawyer hard across the face and walks away.]
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time later, Nikki and Paulo's bodies have been placed in the grave. A group of survivors have gathered for their funeral.]
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nikki and Paulo. I guess we didn't really know you very well. And it appears, you killed each other for diamonds. But I know there are good parts to you too. You were always nice to me. And you're a member of the camp. And... I really loved ExposÃƒÂ©. OK then, goodbye-
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Wait.
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pours the diamonds into his hands, and throws them over the bodies]
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 8 hours ago. Nikki leads Paulo through the jungle.]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Come on. You can just tell me.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Na-uh, it's a surprise. We're almost there. OK, ready?
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Yeah.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	I found the diamonds, Paulo.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	[A shot of confusion goes across his face] What? Where?
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Right here.
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo looks on the ground as Nikki frowns.]
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Give 'em to me.
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What're you talking about?
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	What am I talking about? [Pulls out the gum] What's this? Your nicotine gum. You wanted to stop looking for the bag cause you'd already found it. I know you have them, Paulo, so where are they?!
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Calm down, OK?
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki unscrews a glass bottle with a spider inside.]
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What the hell's that?
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki opens the bottle and thrusts it at Paulo, causing the spider to land on his neck and bite him.]
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Are you out of your mind?
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You remember Dr. Arzt's friend. Did it bite you? Does it hurt? He told me why they call it the Medusa Spider. Wanna know why?
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo begins to shake and grabs Nikki.]
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What did you do?
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Because one look from Medusa will turn anyone to stone, just like one bite from the spider will paralyze you, for about eight hours. It won't kill you, it'll just slow your heart rate down to the point of where even a doctor would have a hard time-
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo falls to the ground.]
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	-hearing it beat. You won't be able to move a muscle, so I'll be able to do, all sorts of nasty things to you. And since it bit you on your neck, I'd say paralysis will happen fast. I'm guessing that you have the diamonds on you. Huh?
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nikki searches Paulo.]
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	In a shoe, maybe?
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Finding nothing, she throws the shoe away, and it catches in a tree.]
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	[Pauses] I think I know where...
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She undoes Paulo's belt and zipper, and pulls out the pouch from his underwear.]
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Son of a bitch.
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	I'm sorry.
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You're only sorry cause you got caught.
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	I was, afraid, of losing you. If you found the diamonds, you wouldn't need me any more.
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Nikki looks on forgivingly, the clicking sound of the Monster can be heard. As Nikki looks around, numerous male Medusa spiders approach. One crawls on Nikki's leg, and she shakes it off, but not before it bites her.]
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Ow, dammit! Oh no! No! No, no.
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She runs through the jungle and buries the diamond pouch in the dirt. She then arrives at the beach, finding Hurley and Sawyer.]
