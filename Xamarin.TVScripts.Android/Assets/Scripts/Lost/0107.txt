10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie looking very sweaty trying to play guitar.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Charlie. Charlie. How about you and I go for walk?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No. No thanks, Locke. I think I'm going to stay in today.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Come on. Fresh air will do you good.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie looks terrible. They stare at each other a moment.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cut to Jack holding Kate's mug shots.]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[entering] I take better pictures than that. Smaller, too, if you want something for your wallet.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I just came by for a few things and this was. . . this was with my stuff. [He hands it to her].
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So you're not staying?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Call me a broken record, but caves are a natural shelter. And a hell of a lot safer than living here on the beach.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're mad at me.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. Kate, I'm -- I just don't understand why you won't come with me. Us. It's maybe a mile up there, if that.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We crashed 8 days ago, Jack. I'm not setting up a house here.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I want off this Island too, but we both know that's not going to happen any time soon.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid has a plan.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, to find the source of the distress code, I know.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The signal's coming from somewhere on the Island. If we can find it. . .
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The signal has been running on a loop for 16 years, Kate. And the woman that left it, she wasn't rescued. What makes you think it's going to be any different for us?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I believe it.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I wish I shared your faith.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[entering] Wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you want, Sawyer?
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Heard the doctor was vacating the premises. Thought I'd best lay claims to my new digs before somebody else did [he drops his suitcases]. I could fix this place up real good. Might even find somebody to share it with me [looking at Kate].
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Kate] I'll talk to you later.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate watches Jack leave with a sad look on her face. Sawyer, smiling, waves.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie walking in the jungle. We hear animal grunting sounds.]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Locke, is that you?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[running, slow motion, VO] Bless me father, for I have sinned.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[in a confessional with priest] It's been a week since my last confession.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PRIEST	Go ahead my son.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Last night I had physical relations with a girl I didn't even know.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PRIEST	I see. Anything else?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. Uh, right after that I had relations with another girl. Then straight after that I watched while they had relations with each other. You see, it's, it's my band, father, Drive Shaft. We've been playing the clubs in Manchester. And, uh, we've been getting some heat, a following, you know, and, uh, the girls. There's some real temptations that come with the territory, if you know what I mean.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PRIEST	Well, we all have our temptations, but giving in to them, that's your choice. As we live our lives it's really nothing but a series of choices, isn't it?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, then, I've made my choice. I have to quit the band.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie leaving the church. Someone is there drumming on the pews.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	And the meek shall inherit the earth.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Liam, what are doing? This is a church.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Relax, choir boy. I bring good tidings of great joy. We've just been signed. A recording contract. You're going to be a rock god.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Charlie running from a boar. Some luggage falls, the boar is trapped in a large net trap.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nice work, Charlie. You make excellent bait.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[angrily] I'm glad I could oblige. Now give me my bloody drugs.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Did you hear what I said? I want my drugs back. I need 'em.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yet you gave them to me. Hmm.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	And I bloody well regret it. I'm sick, man. Can't you see that?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think you're a lot stronger than you know, Charlie. And I'm going to prove it to you. I'll let you ask me for your drugs three times. The third time, I'm going to give them to you. Now, just so we're clear, this is one.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why? Why? Why are you doing this? To torture me? Just get rid of them and have done with it?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	If I did that you wouldn't have a choice, Charlie. And having choices, making decisions based on more than instinct, is the only thing that separates you from him [indicating the boar].
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke grabs the boar's ear and goes to slash it's throat. Charlie looks away.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of an antenna on a pole. Sayid, Boone and Kate on the beach.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Three antenna. Three points of a triangle. One here on the beach. Another, Kate will position in the jungle, roughly two kilometers in, and the third I'll take to high ground, up there. If the French transmission is coming from somewhere within our triangulation, I'll be able to locate the source. But there are two complications.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Of course there are.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The power cells I grafted onto the antennas are dry. There's no telling how long they'll last. A minute -- maybe more, maybe less.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So we have to wait until we're in position before we switch them on.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Wait. Wait a second. How are we going to be able to tell that we're actually in the right position? We have no way to communicate with each other.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid grabs bottle rockets from a pack.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Bottle rockets?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Thank God for fireworks smugglers. Now, when I'm in position I'll fire off my rocket. When you two see it, you fire yours. As soon as the last one has gone up we all switch on our antennas.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay, but you said there are two complications.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The battery in the transceiver is dead. Without the transceiver all of this is for nothing. Something from a laptop computer would probably work, but I've not been able to find anything.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I think I might know where to look.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate at Sawyer's place.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're hoarding like a pack rat since the crash and you don't have a single laptop?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We are testy. Still upset about your little break up? You and Jacko?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It must be exhausting.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's that?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Living like a parasite -- always taking, never giving.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, you got me pegged, don't you?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I get it now. You don't want off this Island because there's nothing for you to go back for. Nobody you miss. And no one misses you.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, you're feeling sorry for me.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't feel sorry for you. I pity you.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks hurt, then smiles, then reaches into a suitcase, pulls out a laptop, and gives her the battery.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All you had to do was say please.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She reaches for it, and he pulls it away and then hands it to her again.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie playing guitar. Charlie notices Hurley and Jack carrying luggage into the caves.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, what's in these things, cinderblocks?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I packed everything I thought might be useful here without leaving the others shorthanded.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, you guys need a hand? [Hurley and Jack drop what they're carrying]. I used to load the band's equipment, before we had roadies, way back in the day. Here let me.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, the zipper's...
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie grabs a bag and everything spills out.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	...broken.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry, just trying to help.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know, I know, it's okay. [to Hurley)] Hey, want to help me grab the rest of those bags?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, could I?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie riffling through the bag looking at the Rx bottles.]
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you doing?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, uh, I have a headache.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[grabbing the bottle Charlie's holding] Diazepam. That's for anxiety.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I was looking for aspirin.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Pretty strong stuff for a headache.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, right.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, you okay? You're looking a little...
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, it's nothing, it's just a headache.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie starts cleaning up the spilled suitcase.]
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, leave it. Go get some water. Maybe you're dehydrated. Charlie, I got it. Go take care of yourself, man. We don't need you right now.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie goes back to his guitar looking grumpy and lonely.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We hear the sound of church bells.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Come on, Charlie boy. We can't do this without you. You are bloody Drive Shaft.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see nuns walking by.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Watch the language.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	[holding the record contract] This is our shot at the big time. What? You don't want to be famous?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's not about all that. I only care about the music.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Yeah, your music. Your songs that got us signed. I'm just a clown with a pretty face that sings them. And you want to take away my chance to be somebody?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Liam, it's not about you. It's -- I love the band. It's not who I am. Sometimes I just get lost in it.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Won't happen -- because I'll be there looking out for you. We'll look out for each other. That's what brothers do, right? Right?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Liam starts horsing around with Charlie.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Wait, wait, wait wait wait. Just promise me one thing. If things get too crazy no matter what, if I say we're done, we walk away.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	We walk away.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Liam, promise.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	We walk away. You're the rock god baby brother.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Big smiles and then they run around, playing.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Jin getting water in a bowl from the spring. Shot of handcuff still on his wrist. Sun approaches.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€ ÂÃ«ÂªÂ©Ã¬Ââ€ž Ã¬ÂËœÃ¬â€šÂ¬Ã¬â€”ÂÃªÂ²Å’ Ã¬Â¢â‚¬ Ã«Â³Â´Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã¬Â¤ËœÃ¬â€¢Â¼ÃªÂ²Â Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Å¡â€. [Subtitle: You should have the doctor look at your wrist.]

242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Hurley walking into the caves carrying a guitar.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, dude. This yours?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh yeah. You're probably wondering because I play bass in Drive Shaft. I wrote a bunch of tunes on that -- You, All, Everybody.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Listen, uh, man. Jack just wants you to find another place for it. He's moving supplies and says it's in the way.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[walking inside the cave where Jack is] You know? A lot of people look up to me. They respect me. And you, you just treat me like I'm some bloody child! Like I'm some useless joke!
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you talking about?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Charlie's not good enough to do this, Charlie's just in the way. Put Charlie onto that.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sit down. Let me take a look at you man.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, you're going to look out for me, yeah?! We'll look out for each other, that's how it is?! I'm not interested!
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, just calm down, alright. You're not yourself.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You don't know me! I'm a bloody rock god!
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Then the cave caves in.]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, no.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin and Sun look. Hurley, Jin and Sun run up. Charlie runs out of the rubble.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Charlie, where's Jack? Where's Jack?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie points to the blocked cave.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack, Jack can you hear me?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know what happened. We were just talking and it -- and it came down on us -- all happened so fast.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, we gotta get help. Charlie, go down to the beach and get help.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, I'm on it.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And make sure you tell Kate!
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate and Sayid walking in the jungle.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What we're doing -- chasing some phantom distress signal -- what are the odds of this working?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No worse than the odds of our surviving that plane crash.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	People survive plane crashes all the time.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Not like this one. The tail section broke off while we were still in the air. Our section cart wheeled through the jungle and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes. How do you explain that?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Blind, dumb luck?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No one's that lucky. We shouldn't have survived.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sorry, Sayid, some things just happen, no rhyme, no reason.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie running onto the beach.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, hey, we need help.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What's wrong, man?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's Jack, he's trapped.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	A cave collapsed. We don't even know if he's alive. Come on, we've gotta go.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, uh, uh, Scott?
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STEVE	I'm Steve.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SCOTT	I'm Scott.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We've got an emergency, grab a couple of guys and let's go.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We've got to go now.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone starts running off with them, but runs back to Shannon.]
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon, you have to be ready to do something really important, okay? At 5 o'clock sharp you have to be ready to turn that antenna on over there. There's a switch at the base.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Why?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Because Kate and Sayid are triangulating the French signal. But the antenna's power's really weak so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets. Then you fire this one. Then you turn on the antenna. Got it?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	The switch is where now?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Did you hear a word I said? Can you or can't you do it?
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah, I can.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Okay, [hands her the bottle rocket] okay.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[running to go back to the caves] Wait. Kate. Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sorry sport, you just missed her. Her and Mohammad headed into the woods about 10 minutes ago.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Which way?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't sweat it, amigo. I know which way they went.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, but-
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll tell her. You just keep doing... whatever it is you do around here.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Drive Shaft on stage. Liam takes Charlie's part singing. We see Liam being greeted back stage and Liam pouring booze. Charlie's pissed.]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What the hell was that?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	That was another kick ass show. You were bloody brilliant.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I sing the chorus to You All Everybody.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Oh yeah, sorry about that. [a photographer approaches]. Got caught up in the moment. The crowd wanted it, you know.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, I know. If I start and then you come in after me...
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	[to security] She's cool. Let her in. (to Charlie) I won't let it happen again. I promise. (Liam gets the groupie, pulls out some drugs and Charlie sees). Chill, baby brother.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Charlie back at beach.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see people at the caves moving rocks out of the way. Michael runs up with Walt and Vincent.]
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Wait. Hey wait.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack's in there.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Let me check it out before you start moving things around. If it's unstable...
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, how do you know-
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	8 years of construction work. Hey Walt, get back, man, I don't want you near the rocks, okay, and take the dog with you.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	You guys need Mr. Locke.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Locke's out in the jungle killing stuff. Who knows where he is.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael looks around at the cave.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Alright, this area here is load-bearing. We've got to dig where there's no danger of the wall buckling in on itself. Here, we dig in here so the wall doesn't collapse. Four at a time, by hand, until we can find some kind of shovel. We take shifts, and go slow. Whoever isn't digging should be clearing the rocks that we clear out and bring the water to whoever is working, okay. Let's move.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Walt looking on, proud of/surprised by his father.]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Sayid in the jungle. Sawyer enters.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What the hell are you doing here?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Easy. Just came to tell you something.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What makes you think I'm interested in anything you have to say?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[after a long pause] Just came to tell you, you were right about me that I don't help anyone but myself. Well, here I am, ready to pitch in.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're here to help?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Sayid walk away.]
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, you act anymore surprised and I'm going to get offended.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke skinning the boar and Charlie enters looking bedraggled.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Something wrong, Charlie?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, Jack. He's a -- there's been an accident at the caves. Jack's trapped in a cave-in.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is anyone trying to get him out?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, there's a bunch of people there now.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then why aren't you with them? You didn't come here to tell me about Jack, did you?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[looking like he going to cry] I want my stash, Locke. I can't stand feeling like this.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Come here. Let me show you something. [They walk to a plant with a cocoon on it]. What do you suppose is in that cocoon, Charlie?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know, a butterfly, I guess?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, it's much more beautiful than that. That's a moth cocoon. It's ironic, butterflies get all the attention; but moths -- they spin silk, they're stronger, they're faster.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That's wonderful, but...
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You see this little hole? This moth's just about to emerge. It's in there right now, struggling. It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now, I could help it, take my knife, gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free. But it would be too weak to survive. The struggle is nature's way of strengthening it. Now this is the second time you've asked me for your drugs back [he holds the heroin up]. Ask me again and it's yours.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of people moving rocks. Michael struggling at the opening, then something gives.]
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, we're through, we got a hole.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack? Jack? Can you hear me, Jack? Come on dude, answer me.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sounds of moaning.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I hear him.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[to others behind him] He's alive.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack, bro, you okay?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm pinned. I can't move. I can't move.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Michael] What do we do? How do we get him out?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie was with me.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He's okay. He made it out.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey listen, Jack, we're going to get you out of there, okay?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack moaning and coughing.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid, Kate, and Sawyer hiking. They reach the 'high ground' area.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We'll place the second antenna here. [to Sawyer] You want to help?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer nods, Kate pulls the antenna out of Sayid's pack and hands it to him. Sayid hands it Sawyer.]
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Attach this antenna up in that tree, as high up as you can.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Golly, thanks, boss. [He walks toward the tree].
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[in a lowered voice to Kate] Five o'clock. Watch for my flare, then it's your turn. I don't trust him.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Who does?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't trust him with you.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I can handle him.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid leaving. Sawyer up in the tree.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of people at the caves, Michael moving through the shot.]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Okay, we can't safely make that tunnel any bigger, but since Jack can't get out, one of us is going to have to go in and un-pin him.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What, crawl through that?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I think we need someone smaller.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€šÂ´ Ã¬â„¢â‚¬Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã­â€â€žÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã«â€œÂ¤ Ã«â€¢Å’Ã«Â¬Â¸Ã¬â€”Â Ã¬Å“â€žÃ­â€”ËœÃ¬â€”Â Ã«Â¹Â Ã¬Â§â‚¬Ã«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â¸ Ã«Â³Â¼ Ã¬Ë†Å“ Ã¬â€”â€ Ã¬â€“Â´.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, we don't understand Chinese.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Korean, man. They're Korean.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[off camera, entering] I'll do it.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Charlie?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No, man. Look, you're still too shook up. I might be able to squeeze through...
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, who's going to take care of your son if something happens. [he points to Sun] She's got a husband, [to Boone] he's got a sister. I'm alone here, no one on the Island. Let me do this.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer sitting on the ground. Kate is standing with the bottle rocket, looking at her watch.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Still ain't five, just like the last time you checked your watch.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I just don't want to miss Sayid's signal. Remember, I'll fire the flare, you set off the antenna.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I just thank the good lord I've got you here to keep reminding me.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So what is it about that guy -- Jack. [Kate sits down by Sawyer] What it is about him makes you all weak in the loins.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do you try to be a pig, or does it just come naturally?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So, he's a doctor, right? Yeah, the ladies dig the doctors. Hell, give me a couple of band aids, a bottle of peroxide, I could run this Island too.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're actually comparing yourself to Jack?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[looking hurt] The difference between us ain't that big, sweetheart. I guarantee you, if he had survived a few more weeks on this Island you'd have figured that out.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What did you just say?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ah, damn. Didn't I tell you? Word from the valley is Saint Jack got himself buried in a cave-in.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look at the bright side, now you have someone else to pity.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate tossing the bottle rocket at Sawyer's feet and running off.]
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie, Hurley, Michael back at the caves.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Listen, man, go slow. Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Anything else?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, good luck.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[handing Charlie water] Be safe man.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Good luck, Charlie.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Alright, thanks guys.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie looking into the opening, then looking back at everyone. He starts into the tunnel.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Charlie after a gig. People shouting "Drive Shaft! Drive Shaft!" He goes into the green room. Liam is there, sitting on a couch with a girl on either side.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	[to the girls] Everybody wants more, everybody wants to have a piece. All these people, they can't leave you alone when you're...
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Bloody hell.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Hey, baby brother, grab a bird and sit down.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to a girl standing at the buffet table] Get out. [to another girl] You too, get out.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Oh, I spilled on myself.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to the second girl] Out!
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Out?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to the girls on the couch] Come on, now!
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Come back in five minutes.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The girls leave the room.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sound check, you missed sound check, you don't show up for rehearsal. We've got a show in an hour.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	[clearly high] Oooh, show. I like shows.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Liam gets his drugs. Charlie looks on worriedly.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Alright, that's it. After tonight, we cancel the rest of the tour.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	What?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We walk away.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Are you off your head?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're walking away like we said we would if things got...
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Walk away and go where?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Liam, you're killing yourself with this junk, you're destroying Drive Shaft!
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	[yelling] I am Drive Shaft! Nobody even knows who the sodding bass player is! This is it, Charlie -- end of the rainbow. You really think you can walk away? Then what, eh? Face it, if you're not in this band, what the bloody hell use are you?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Liam staggers out.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Liam?
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Piss off!
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie, devastated, alone. He sits in front of the mirror and takes a long look at himself. He pushes a bottle out the way and notices the drugs Liam left behind. He picks up a bag and begins to cry.]
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Charlie squeezing through the tunnel. It starts rumbling and bits of dirt start falling. Shot of Michael and Hurley looking in from the entrance.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Charlie? Charlie move! Charlie?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie crawling as fast as he can to the opening cave-side. The tunnel collapses. Charlie finds Jack.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hi. I'm... I'm here to rescue you.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack smiles at him. Charlie smiles back.]
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Hurley, Michael, Boone at the caves. Shot of Kate entering.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I say we try again.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We can't just leave them.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	If we don't move, they're going to run out of air.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Would you stop talking, I'm trying to think.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where is he? Where is he?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Kate.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where is he? Where's Jack?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of everyone looking helpless, and they don't want to tell her.]
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[nodding toward the now rubble-filled tunnel entrance] He's in there.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Does anyone know if he's alive? Is he alive?
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We don't know. Charlie went in there through a tunnel that we dug, but it collapsed.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why is nobody digging? [she starts digging, the others follow.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack and Charlie in the cave. Charlie is trying to get some leverage on the rock pinning Jack.]
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, one, two, three. [He moves the rock, Jack yells out in pain, and holds his shoulder]. Sorry, Jack. Sorry. You alright?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My shoulder's dislocated.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[looking terrified] What?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're going to have to pop it back in.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, I can't.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I need your help on this, man.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I can't do it, Jack.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes you can. Yes you can.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, what do I -- what do I do?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Take my hand...
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This hand? Okay, okay, wait, okay, okay [Charlie positions himself].
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Now, when I tell you to, pull as hard as you possibly can.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Jack, I don't know, I don't, I don't...
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You can do this, Charlie.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Now.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie pulls his arm. Jack yells out, grabs his shoulder.]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of a wind chime on a porch. We see Charlie walking up to the door of nice house, and the door opens.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	[off camera] Charlie? What are you doing here?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	A bloke can't pay his big brother a visit once in a while?
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Of course you can. Why didn't you call, you lunatic. [They hug]. What are you doing in Sydney?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie and Liam in the yard. Liam is pushing his young daughter on a swing.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's all lined up, Liam. 8 weeks on tour opening for some band called Meat Coat. First gig's in Los Angeles. LA, Liam. This is a chance to get back on a label, a real one.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Liam sets is daughter in a sandbox. Liam and Charlie sit down at a table.]
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This is our comeback.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Charlie, I don't want to come back.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, right. Well, here's the thing. They won't book Drive Shaft without you. So I'm asking as a brother, the way you asked me.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	You were with me the night I missed Megan's birth. You were the one I was stumbling around Dresden with trying to find a sodding fix. Oh man, you're still using, aren't you?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Don't change the subject.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	That's why you haven't been returning my calls.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Look, are you going to go on tour with us or not?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	You said you were going to get some help, man.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I lost your sodding number, okay?
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	You're still a junkie.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You did this to me! It was about the music! The music, Liam. You took that away from me.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Listen, why don't you stay with us for a few weeks. Karen and me, we can get you help. Sydney's got some really good programs.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Forget it. [He gets up and walks away]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Don't go.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Thanks for your help, brother.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Stay, please. I'm just looking out for you!
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[angry] You never looked out for me! I have a plane to catch.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Slow motion of Charlie walking away.]
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie in the cave. His hand is shaking.]
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How long has it been, Charlie?
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know what you're going on about.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How long since your last fix?
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Almost a day and a half.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How's the withdrawal treating you? Any hallucinations?
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Apart from the conversation I had with you about an hour ago in the jungle, no, not really.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why didn't you say anything? I could've helped you through this.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, you think I'm useless, and a junkie to boot.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Useless? You're not useless. That took a lot of guts getting in here and trying to rescue me. I won't forget that.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[ironically] For the rest of our lives?
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	At the rate we're using our oxygen in here, that won't be too long.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This place, it reminds me of confession, those little claustrophobic booths.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I wouldn't have taken you for a religious man.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I used to be. Hey, you want to hear my confession? Might take a while.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, I'm no saint, either. [Charlie sees something] What's wrong?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's a moth.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	A what?
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right behind you, look. There's a bloody moth in here. Look. [Charlie starts to follow it.]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, what are you doing?
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie is feeling around in the cave.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of people on the outside pulling rubble away.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey Kate, you need to take a break.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm fine.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We've got enough people to dig. You keep going at this pace your going to kill yourself.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back in the cave.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	There's light.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I can see light.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside they are digging. Inside Charlie is crawling. Shot of ground outside. Then Charlie's hand comes up through the ground. Shot of people outside digging. Shot of Walt. Vincent barks.]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Hey, it's the doctor.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Charlie enter. Kate gives Jack a huge hug.]
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ow, easy, my shoulder, careful.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How'd you get out?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, Charlie found a way out.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, you rock.
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Congratulations all around. Shot of Charlie looking proud/happy.]
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid as he looks at his watch. He says a quick prayer and lights the bottle rocket.]
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to himself] Alright everyone, now it's your turn.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon laying on beach talking to a female redshirt.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	We're in Malibu part of the year, but the guys there are such idiots.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We can hear the sound of the rocket exploding. The redshirt points to the sky].
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[hurrying] Dammit! Dammit, dammit, dammit. [She lights the rocket].
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[seeing the beach rocket explode] Come on, come on, one more. Come on Kate. Come on.
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the third rocket go off.]
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes. Yes. [He gets the transceiver out of his pack and turns it on. The little screen says, acquiring signal.] Where are you? [The little screen says Receiving Signal] Yes!!! [The little screen shows a strong signal] Where are you? Where are you?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see movement behind Sayid. We hear some noise. Then Sayid gets whacked on the head with a big stick and falls to the ground unconscious.]
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Hurley getting some water from the spring. He gives water to Charlie and Jack.]
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Charlie] Dude, you feeling okay? You look a little...
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Flu. He's got the flu.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh man, that's rough after all you've been through. Take it easy, man.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie looking gratefully at Jack. Shot of Locke waiving a palm frond over the boar which is cooking on a spit. We see Charlie watching him.]
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I think I'm going to stretch my legs.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Walt and Michael]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	This place is cool. Can we live here?
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael looks over at Sun. She returns his gaze. Shot of Jack looking at the fire. Then we see a rag being put over his head. Kate has brought him a sling.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Made you something.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Awww. My very first sling.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How's that?
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good. Thank you.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So these are the safe caves you've been going on about.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This was a fluke. Michael checked out the integrity of the rest of the caves and gave them an okay. So you're heading back to the beach, huh?
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid should be back there by now and if his plan worked then...
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then we're one step closer to getting off this Island.
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks down (thinking about getting off the Island).]
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks for the sling, Kate.
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're welcome.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke brushing the boar. Charlie walks up.]
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Give them to me.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	This is the third time. Are you sure you really want them?
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I've made my choice.
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke hands the drugs to Charlie. Charlie looks at them and throws them in the fire. Locke smiles.]
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm proud of you, Charlie. Always knew you could do it.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie looks up and sees a moth.]
