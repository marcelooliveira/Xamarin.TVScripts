6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley, Sun, Jack, and Frank have just arrived at the Man in Black's camp.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello, Jack. I was hoping you'd come.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley hands Locke his torch.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think we have some catching up to do.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks up to Hurley.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley. This was your idea. You alright with me talking with him alone?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Handing Jack a gun.] It's all you, dude.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Locke] Alright, let's catch up.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Locke walk away. They arrive at a clearing. Locke sits down on a log. Jack remains standing, facing Locke.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look just like him.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Does it bother you?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, what bothers me is I don't have any idea what the hell you are.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sure you do.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack kneels.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why John Locke?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because he was stupid enough to believe that he'd been brought here for a reason. Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He had to be dead before you could look like him.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's right.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack nods.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who else have you looked like?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The third day we were here I saw... I chased my father through the jungle... my, my dead father. Was that you?
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes, that was me.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why?
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You needed to find water. This may be hard for you to believe, Jack, but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	To help me? To do what?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Leave. But because Jacob chose you, you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here. Now Jacob's dead. We don't have to be trapped anymore. We can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If we can just fly away whenever we want, why are you still here?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because it has to be all of us.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks momentarily emotional.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John Locke was the only one of us that ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this island.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	John Locke was not a believer, Jack. [They both stand] He was a sucker.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Locke is in an ambulance.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #1	[Talking into a radio.] Sinus tach at one-thirty. BP dropping. Last read was sixty-two over thirty possibly due to internal bleeding.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN ON RADIO	Any signs of neurological damage?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #1	No response in lower reflexes.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's because he's a paraplegic.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #1	You know this man?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes, he's a substitute teacher at my school. His name is Locke... Mr. Locke. I don't know his first name, but he uses a wheelchair. Where is it?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #1	Smashed to pieces. That thing probably saved his life.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I saw the man that did this... the, the hit-and-run driver. He, he was at our school--
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #1	When we get to the hospital you can talk to the cops. Do you know anyone we can contact for him?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I have no idea. Like I said, I barely know him.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Helen.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What did you say?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Helen Norwood. I was gonna marry her.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, you're still gonna marry her 'cause you're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	John. My name is John.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[An EMT opens the doors to the ambulance and Locke is wheeled out.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #1	Blunt-force trauma victim. Late forties, male. He needs a CT scan.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun is being wheeled out of another ambulance right next to the one Locke was just wheeled out of.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #2	We got a gun shot wound here. Female, entry wound. Upper right quadrant.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Walking next to Sun's stretcher.] Baby! Baby!
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #2	Yes, sir, I understand. She's pregnant. We're gonna take good care of her. Five-hundred cc's
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Baby!
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #2	External blood loss.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Baby!
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMT #2	We're gonna do everything we can.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€¢Ë†Ã«ÂÂ¼... Ã¬â€¢Ë†Ã«ÂÂ¼! [Subtitle: No...No!]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â„¢Å“ ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å¾Ëœ? [Subtitle: Sun, what is it?]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã«Å¾Å’... Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã«Å¾Å’Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã¬â€¢Â¼! Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã«Å¾Å’... [Subtitle: It's him! It's him! It's him!]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Locke and Jack are walking through the jungle.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke hears something and they stop suddenly, looking into the darkness.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is it?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You can come out!
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire appears and approaches them.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You following us, Claire?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	'Cause he's my brother.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire smiles.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Looks like you two have a lot of catching up to do. I'll leave you to it.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke leaves, handing Jack the torch.]
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th--
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Did he tell you? That he was the one pretending to be our father?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Yeah, he told me.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You know, I pretty much gave up hoping that you'd ever come back. Now that you're here...
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Clare pauses, sighs, then smiles.]
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	It's... it's good to see you, Jack.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, it's good to see you too.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You know, I-I never really had much in the way of family, so it...really means a lot that you're coming with us.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Actually, I haven't-I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, you have.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you mean?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You decided the moment you let him talk to you, just like the rest of us. So, yeah, whether you like it or not, you're with him now.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the Man in Black's camp.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Has he got a submarine?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispers] Keep your voice down, damn it. Yeah, Widmore's got a sub. We can use it to get off this rock.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Are we gonna tell Sun?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kate's telling her now. Thought we might want to avoid huddles.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What about Sayid?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sayid ain't invited. He's gone over to the dark side.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, Anakin--
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who the hell's Anakin? Look, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothing to no one.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, Claire.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey, Hurley.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You look great.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks past Hurley and Claire embracing at Locke and Jack returning to camp.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's so nice to have everyone back together again.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Sawyer eating an apple and walking in police station.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Want an apple?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate doesn't respond.]
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, Schaub, I'm the one who brought her in. Wanna give us a minute?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Officer Schaub nods and leaves.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Katherine Anne Austen. You're wanted for arson, assault on a federal officer, murder in the first degree.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Background indistinct police radio chatter.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Funny, you don't strike me as the murdering kind.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That's because I'm not.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You be sure and mention that to feds when they get here.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	There something you wanted?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You remember me? The airport? We were on the same flight from Sydney.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I remember.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, don't you think it's weird--you and me being on the same flight, having that little meet-up in the elevator? And a week later--boom, of all the cars in Los Angeles, you smash into mine. Almost like someone's trying to put us together.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you hitting on me?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[laughs] It'd never work, sweetheart. I'm a cop, you're a murderer.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I already told you, I'm not a murderer.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So, why didn't you arrest me?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I did arrest you.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, in L.A.X., the elevator, you saw I was wearing handcuffs.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I didn't see any handcuffs. All I saw was a pretty lady who needed the door held open for her.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You know what I think? I think you let me go because you went to Australia, and you didn't want anyone to know you were there. Should I tell that to the feds when they get here?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, I like you.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Mm.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Jim, got a live one. Come on.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sorry, duty calls.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	We caught a multiple homicide at a restaurant. Victims were a lowlife named Keamy and three goons on his payroll. Korean female GSW at the scene, and her boyfriend witnessed it, but he doesn't speak English.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Any suspects?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah, an ATM surveillance camera grabbed this jabroni fleeing the scene.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All righty. Put a name to that face. [Security tape film shows Sayid leaving a building.] That's our bad guy.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At Locke's camp, Kate and Jack are sitting together looking at Sayid across the camp.]
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's different now.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[nods] Guess we're all different now.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So what did Locke say to you?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Said that he wants to leave, and we all have to go together.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	And do you believe him?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not sure yet.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sound of a rifle cock as Zoe walks into camp.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Hands up. Stop right there.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Where's the man in charge?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Who's she?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's Widmore's number two.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke comes out of a tent and smiles at Zoe.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What can I do for you?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	You took something from us, and we want it back.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Zoe reaches for something in her back pocket. Rifles cock.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's okay.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	[speaking into walkie-talkie] Do you have fix on my position?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Roger that.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Show them what we're capable of.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Whistling sound overhead, followed by a loud explosion. Everyone ducks, except Locke, who does not flinch.]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	You have until nightfall to return what you took; or next time, we won't miss.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Zoe tosses walkie-talkie to Locke, who catches it.]
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Call me when you're ready for us to pick him up.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Zoe walks off. Locke drops walkie-talkie to the ground and smashes it with the stick he had whittled.]
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well...here we go.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Claire enters a building and speaks with man at reception desk.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh, hi. I have an appointment with the Western Pacific Adoption Agency.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Fifteenth floor, and sign in, please.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Sure. [Claire signs in. Looks up suspiciously at Desmond as he addresses her.]
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey there. How are you? Uh, we met at the airport. The, uh, the baggage claim.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, yeah, right.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Nice. I'm Desmond. Desmond Hume. Um, I never got your name. Uh... [looks at the sign-in sheet.] "Claire Littleton." So--So how you doin'?
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Um, I'm okay. Better now. I actually had a bit of a scare, ended up in the hospital.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you...
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, no. All good now, so... Oh, by the way, uh, you were right. It's a boy.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I have a nose for these things. Look, um...excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but I couldn't help noticing you're going to an adoption agency...alone.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh...yeah. You're right. It is personal.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No, I just meant that you should have some--some legal representation.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What, are you a lawyer?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No, no. But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my to see one. You know, adoption contracts are complicated; and, you should be careful because you could find yourself in a situation that's irreversible.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, I-I don't have money for a lawyer.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond follows Claire onto an elevator, she presses 15th floor button.]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What floor?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Um...I'm--I'm going to 15 as well. Look, this, um, this attorney I'm seeing--she's excellent. Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor. So...why don't you just come and meet her? You know, I think she could really help you.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire and Desmond leave elevator.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Look, I promise you it won't cost you a cent. Please. It'd be my absolute pleasure.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh, sure.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Great, this way.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond holds a door open for Claire. They enter a law office and stop at receptionist.]
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hi. Uh, Desmond Hume to see Miss Verdansky, please.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RECEPTIONIST	[types at computer] Oh, yes, Mrs. Hume, she's expecting you. Have a seat.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Great.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey, um...thank you.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're very welcome.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	[with an American accent] Desmond!
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They embrace and kiss on the cheek.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Ah, Ilana. Uh, Claire, this is Ilana. Ilana, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Claire Littleton.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Claire Littleton, um...
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I was hoping you'd be able to help her, um...
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	I'm sorry...Claire Littleton from Australia?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Um, do I know you?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	No, but this is a quite a coincidence. We've been looking for you. Desmond, do you mind if I speak with Miss Littleton alone for a few minutes?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No, absolutely fine. Go right ahead.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire follows Ilana away from reception area.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Claire walks into Locke's camp and goes to Hurley.]
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Listen up, everyone.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey. What's going on?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	People trying to kill us again.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All this is happening a bit sooner than I'd expected, but these people have forced our hand, claiming we stole something from them, trying to provoke us into a confrontation. Well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get. Gather your things, we're going to the other island and we're getting on that plane. James, I need your help with something.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They walk away as Jack watches them.]
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	There's a boat moored just a few hours down the shore from here. I want you to get it and meet the rest of us on the other side of these bluffs. [Locke shows James a map] We'll all sail over to the other island together.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How come we're not all heading for it together?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The bigger the group, the slower it moves.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All right. I could use another pair of hands.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Take whoever you want.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How about it, Freckles? Know anything about sailing?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I know enough.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Good. We'll be waitin' for ya. Sayid, you got a minute?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack watches Sayid follow Locke. Sawyer approaches Jack.]
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[whispers] Give me a hand with something? [Jack follows Sawyer] Listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. We're not going to that rendezvous point to pick up Locke. I got a deal with Widmore.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What kind of deal?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just listen. First chance you get, double back, hoof it to this spot. [points to map] There's an old dock. Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus. Kate and I will meet you there.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What about Sayid and Claire?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sayid's a zombie and Claire's nuts. She gave up her ticket when she tried to kill Kate. And I ain't gonna let that happen again. It's Hugo, Sun and the pilot. Only them. Understand?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	But, how am I supposed to get us away from--from Locke?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You figure it out.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer hands map to Jack and goes to Kate.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ready to roll?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What was that all about?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Guy talk.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks at Jack as she leaves with Sawyer.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke and Sayid, away from camp.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I need you to go out to where I've got Desmond.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I thought you weren't going to give him back.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm not. You're gonna kill him. And that's not gonna be a problem, is it, Sayid? You do still want what you asked me for, right?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes, I do.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then, go do what I said.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid walks away. Locke heads back to camp.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid, gun in hand, walks toward the well. Points gun at Desmond, who is bloody and sitting in shallow water.]
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So what did he offer ya? If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...I think I have a right to know what you're getting in exchange for it.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He told me I could get something back I lost.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	And what did you lose?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The woman I loved.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	And where is she now?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Dead.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I died...and he brought me back.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So, what will you tell her?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you mean?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	This woman--when she asks you what you did to be with her again...what will you tell her?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Sayid rushes into the home of his brother and Nadia. He grabs a bag and suitcase.]
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	[smiling] Sayid. What's going on?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Everything will be okay for you now. I took care of it.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	What do you mean? Where are you going?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I have to leave.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Did you hurt someone?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nadia, I'm leaving. And I'm never going to be able to come back again.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Doorbell rings.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	What did you do, Sayid?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID [whispers]	Stall them.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nadia goes to the door.]
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Who is it?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	LAPD.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	May I see some identification?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles holds his badge up to the window.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Can you open the door, please. [Nadia opens the door.] Mrs. Jarrah, I'm Detective Straume. I need to ask you some questions. You have a few minutes?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles sees the suitcases and looks at Nadia. Sayid leaves through the rear door, but is tripped by a hose held by Sawyer, who points a gun at Sayid.]
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's good, stay down. [Handcuffs Sayid.] Sayid Jarrah, you're under arrest.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sawyer peers out from the jungle to a boat off shore.]
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thar she blows. [Sawyer and Kate walk onto the beach.] You ready to get wet?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Ah. You sure this is a good idea?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You see a bridge?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Going back to get Locke.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Course not. It's a terrible idea, which is why we ain't doing it.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We're gonna ditch Locke. You, me Jack, Hurley, Sun and that pilot that looks like he's stepped off the set of a Burt Reynolds movie.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	When were you planning on telling me this?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Wait, you didn't say Claire.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She ain't coming. The Claire you came back for is gone.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I promised I would bring her back.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That was before she started drinkin' Locke's kool-aid. She's dangerous, you really want her around Aaron? Let's go. We ain't got much time.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Kate swim to boat.]
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke leads his group through the jungle.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, Claire.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Jack.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How long have you been with Locke?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Ever since you left.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So you trust him?
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACKS	Why?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	'Cause he's the only one that didn't abandon me.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke's followers are walking single file and go in the direction that he points. Locke looks down the line and talks to Sun.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sun. Have you seen Sayid? He was supposed to catch up with us about a half a mile back. [She doesn't answer.] Oh, the silent treatment?
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She takes out a note pad from her bag and writes]: "You did this to me!"
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[scoffs] I'm sorry, Sun, but I didn't do anything to you. [Locke touches Cindy's shoulder.] James should be on his way by now. Just keep everyone moving to the beach, I'll catch up with you there.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Where are you going?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack watches Locke leave.]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, wait up.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah?
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sun.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Lapidus go over to Jack and Hurley. Claire is observing.]
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We have to go now.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Go where?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	There's no time. We just gotta go. Follow me.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Um, I think we should stick to Sawyer's plan, or he'll be really pissed.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go!
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire angrily watches as Jack, Hurley, Sun, Lapidus run away.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid is walking through jungle, with gun in hand.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sayid. Where have you been?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Doing what you asked.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then, what took you so long?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I just shot an unarmed man. I needed a moment.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Did you kill him, Sayid?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Of course, I did. [Sayid smirks.] Go and check, if you like.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Come on, we have a boat to catch.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke walks off. Sayid hesitatingly follows.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Hurley, Sun and Frank are running along the shore, looking for Sawyer's pick up point. They stop, and Jack checks his map.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Hope you know where you're going. Because that smoke thing runs a hell of a lot faster than we do.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer said there'd be a dock around here somewhere.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	There they are!
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Sawyer are waiting on the boat.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alright, let's go. Everybody on board, let's go!
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack's group board the vessel.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Sailin' home on this, huh?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Won't work, not without a bearing. For three years the only DHARMA folk ever got on or off this Island was by sub, so that's what we're doin'. Nice job, doc.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh oh.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire emerges from the jungle, rifle cocked.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Where are you going?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Claire...it's okay.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We're leaving the Island.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Then, uh, why aren't you waiting for John?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because that's not John, and whoever he is, he's not one of us. Claire, come with us. I can get you back to Aaron.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Wait a damn minute-
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer shut up. She is coming or I'm not. Come with us Claire.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[shaking her head] John promised me-
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No I'm promising you. I was there when he was born, and I never should have raised him, it should have been you. I came back to get you so you can be with him again. It's the only reason I came back to the Island, Claire. So please come with us. Let's go home.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire lowers her rifle and approaches the boat.]
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alright, get on the boat before Locke gets here.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate takes Claire's rifle from her.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	He finds out we're gone, he's gonna be mad.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack and David are enter a building. Jack's cellphone rings.]
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to David] It's your mom. [answering the call] Hey. Yeah, we just got here. Thank you. Uhh, I don't know, I'll have him home as soon as I can, maybe like 5 o'clock?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[David gestures to him.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Actually, um, we might grab a bite to eat afterwards, so...maybe more like 7? Alright. Yeah, yeah I'll drop him off.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He closes the phone.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to David] Hey. You know, hearing your grandfather's will being read, I know it's not the most fun, but it'll be over soon, I promise, and it's okay to be sad.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I'm sad for you, Dad.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the Sweetzer-Verdansky offices.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Mr. Shephard.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[shaking her hand] Hello.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	And you must be David.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[shaking her hand] Hi.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	We're set up in the conference room. I've got a surprise for you. Do you believe in fate?
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[David looks to Jack, who gives a dismissive expression. They enter the conference room.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	This is Claire Littleton. Claire, this is Mr. Shephard and his son David.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[shaking her hand] Hello. I'm Jack Shephard.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hi, it's uh, it's really nice to meet you.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You found her.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Actually, she found us.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh. You were in my father's will. Do you mind if I ask you how you knew him?
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I...he was my father too.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack's cellphone rings.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sorry, excuse me. This is the, um, this is the service. [answering the call] Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard. No-no it's not a very good time. Yes, they can go ahead and prep him. I'm 20 minutes away. [he closes the phone] I'm, so sorry, there's been an emergency at the hospital. And, um, we're going to have to reschedule.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - On the boat, Jack is sitting at one end and staring off into the ocean. At the other end, Kate is with Sawyer, who is steering. Lapidus walks to them.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	I know I'm a little late to the party, Captain, but, you mind filling us in on what your game plan is?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	My plan, Chesty, is to land on Hydra Island, get ourselves nice and cuddly with Widmore until we get a chance to jump on that sub. Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's face and make 'em take us home.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	I like that idea...I saw some canned food down in the galley. Anybody else starving?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley, Sun and Claire follow Lapidus. Sawyer interrupts Kate.]
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Freckles, take the wheel a minute?
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sure...Be nice.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, yeah.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer goes to Jack.]
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Didn't think you'd show up, doc.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Taking orders ain't your strong suit. Nice to see you finally came around.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This doesn't feel right.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What doesn't feel right?
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Leaving the island.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Wanna tell me why not?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I remember how I felt last time I left...like a part of me was missing.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They got pills for that, doc.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We were brought here because we're supposed to do something, James. And if Locke--that...that thing--wants us to leave; maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Get off my damn boat.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got a decision to make and you make it now. Either you're with us, you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself, or you're going in the water.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	James, this is a mistake. And I know there's a part of you that feels that. The island's not done with us yet.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well, I'm done with this island. So, if you wanna take a leap of faith, Jack, then take it...Get off my damn boat.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at Kate.]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack jumps overboard, feet first. Kate looks at Jack in the water.]
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack? Jack?! [Kate turns boat.] What did you say to him?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He changed his mind.
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer takes the wheel, stops boat from turning.]
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you mean he changed his mind? What did you say to him?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He ain't coming with us.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We have to go back and get him.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We're done going back, Kate.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - In a hospital room with monitors beeping. Sun awakens to see Jin asleep in a chair and holding her hand. They converse in Korean.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Subtitle: Jin? Jin?.]
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He awakens.]
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Subtitle: You're awake.]
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Subtitle: What happened?]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Subtitle: You were shot. But, you're going to be okay--]
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Subtitle: The baby?]
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Subtitle: The baby's fine. [Sun cries with joy.] It's over...and we're all going to be okay.]
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside the room David and Jack are walking down the hallway.]
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	So, all these years, you had no idea your dad had another kid?
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nope. None.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Wow. I can't believe he never even mentioned her.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, well, your grandfather kept a lot of things to himself.
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Is that where you get it from?
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughts] Yeah, probably... All right, uh, you gonna be okay hangin' while I do this?
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Yeah, sure...Good luck, Dad.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks.
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack scrubs up for Locke's surgery. Views scans and consults with female surgeon.]
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE SURGEON	Car v. ped.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How bad?
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE SURGEON	Bad. But, here's the kicker--the victim was already in a wheelchair, pre-existing spinal condition.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Dural sac's obliterated.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE SURGEON	That's why we called you. We're in a bit over our heads here.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I got this. [In operating room.] We're ready to cut?
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE SURGEON	Say the word.
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Scalpel.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks familiarly at the reflection of Locke's face in a mirror attached to the operating table.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE SURGEON	What is it?
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I think I know this guy.
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack wearily gets to the beach after swimming from the boat. Jack falls to his knees and hands to catch his breath and hears Locke's voice. He looks up to see Locke and some armed members of his group.]
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nice day for a swim...[Jack stands.] Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The boat is moored a short distance from shore. Sawyer, Kate, Lapidus, Hurley, Claire and Sun are getting out of the water after swimming from the boat.]
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Everybody stay close. Camp's over here. Not gonna have much time before Locke figures out we made off with his ride.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore's team appear with rifles drawn.]
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Hands up!
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey! Whoa!
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Drop your weapons!
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Whoa! Take it easy!
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Drop them now! [Sawyer's team drops their weapons]... It's all right. We know him. Who else is with you?
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore team's guns are lowered.]
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nobody. You wonder where Locke is, he's still back on the main island.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	[into walkie-talkie] Turn the fences off. [Jin appears.] Ford just showed up on a boat with five of his friends. [Sun sees Jin.]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sun?
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Jin? [they run toward each other] Jin?
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sun! [they embrace, kiss and cry]
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I love you!
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I love you, too.
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Hurley smile.]
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I never stopped looking for you.
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Lapidus smiles.]
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Looks like someone got their voice back.
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	We'll never be apart again. I promise you.
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Jin kiss. Kate and Sawyer are affected by the reunion.]
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	[speaking on walkie-talkie] Are you sure? I-I understand, Charles.
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That Widmore? [guns are cocked and pointed] What the hell are you doin'?
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	What's it look like I'm doing? Hands up, now! [they raise their hands] On your knees. All of you!
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[to Sun and Jin] Down!
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Jin comply.]
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We had a deal!
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Deal's off...[into walkie-talkie] We got 'em. If you've got a sightline on Locke, fire when ready.
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Roger.
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At beach where Locke's team and Jack are, whistling is heard overhead. Everyone looks up.]
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Get down!
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everybody scrambles for cover, except Locke, who does not flinch. An explosion hurdles Jack to the ground, injures him and distorts his hearing. He sees Locke running toward him as another missile explodes. Locke grabs Jack and carries him to safety.]
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack. You all right? [whistling overhead and loud explosion nearby] Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. You're with me now.
