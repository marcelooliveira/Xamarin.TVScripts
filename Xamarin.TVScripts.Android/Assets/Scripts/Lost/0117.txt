178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Perhaps with an overweight aunt? It's a very sad image.

186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Thanks. You are going to love New York, Walt. No city like it. You know, what I really want to show you in New York are the buildings, the architecture...
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Buildings?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, I used to say that, too, 'til I saw the Flat Iron Building.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What's that?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oldest skyscraper in the city, built in 1902. And it's flat. That one building inspired me to start drawing and, you know, designing things.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Why?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You've just got to see it, man. You want to see it, right?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I guess. Could I go throw the ball to Vincent?

248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	He wasn't always like this. He used to tell me how beautiful I looked to him. He was so tender. And then he was different.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What changed him?

388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Let me tell you about my sister. She likes older men, guys who can take care of her. My guess is, in this place, you fit the bill. She'll make you feel like the greatest guy ever while you get her food, or whatever it is that she needs. And when she gets whatever it is that she wants, she'll move on. When she does, don't take it personally, man.

400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah, in trying making it collapse.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're very capable, Shannon. I'm sure you'll be alright building it on your own.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What's going on?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Perhaps you should find another friend to help you with your shelter.

422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What do you mean you don't know? You two are like jungle pals.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sorry, I haven't seen him.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Well, if you do see him, tell him to keep his stupid mouth shut. And if he does have something to say, he can leave Sayid out of it, and come say it to my face.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Should I be writing this down?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Just tell him to stay the hell out of my business.

438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Are you serious?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because if you do -- like him, what's it got to do with your brother? You're a grown woman. Sure, you can yell at Boone 'til you're blue in the face, but all you're doing is giving him what he wants.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah, what's that?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Your attention. Everyone gets a new life on this Island, Shannon. Maybe it's time you start yours.

606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Okay, it's personal, but why take it out on our best chance of getting off the Island? Why would any one of us block an attempt to get home? We're so intent on pointing the finger at one another that we're ignoring the simple undeniable truth that the problem isn't here, it's there! [pointing to the jungle] They've attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us! Maybe it's time we stop blaming us and start worrying about them!
