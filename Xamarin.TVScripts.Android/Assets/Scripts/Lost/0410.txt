4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Stephen Williams
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is asleep in his tent.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack! Jack! Jack? Jack, I need you to wake up. Jack! Can you hear me? You okay?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Come on! Come on! I just wanna know why.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What happened?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Here.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	He knows somethin'!
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outisde, the survivors question Daniel and Charlotte.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I want the truth!
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	I don't know. That's the truth. I'm telling you, I don't know why, but there's no signal now.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Signal? What, there was a signal when you called them last night.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	That's right.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	So-so-so what? Now they're just ignoring us?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	How are we supposed to know why they're not answering?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh, who's talking to you?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	And in case you haven't noticed, we're not on the bloody boat, are we?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Just watch your tone, Red.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I just wanna know why.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey! Everybody just needs to calm down, okay?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Jack, these people are lying to us.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know they're lying. I know it. Sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them, and when they do, we'll be waiting for them.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Unless they run off again.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Listen to me.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Jack, are you all right?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I'm fine. We just have to be patient, okay? I've gotten us this far. I said I was gonna get us off the Island - all of us. I promised that I would.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack doubles over in pain, falling to the ground.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Woman gasps.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Jack? Jack?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Jack?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Is he all right?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Breathing erratically.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack? Jack.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack is lying in bed with his eyes open. Birds chirp in the distance. The phone rings. It takes Jack a few moments to realize.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Telephone rings.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hello?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JANE	Dr. Shephard? Just confirming your 11:00 consult with Ms. Berenberg. It was moved up yesterday, and I know how you are with your calendar.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JANE	Thank you, doctor.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright . Bye.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He gets up, wraps a towel around his waist and notices a pair of panties on the ground. He picks it up and puts it in the hamper. He then goes downstairs to the kitchen, stubbing his toe on a toy lying on the ground.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ow. Son of a bitch.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He puts wine glasses from the previous night into the sink and makes coffee. Picking up a copy of the day's paper, he sees the sports-page headline, "Yankees bludgeon Red Sox in series sweep.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Scoffs] A-Rod.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He puts the paper down and goes to the bathroom, where the shower is running.]
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Morning.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Morning yourself. I bought you a razor.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What, you don't like the scruff?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	[Laughs] Razor's by the sink, Jack.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shower shuts off. Jack grabs a towel. The shower door opens, and the woman is revealed to be Kate. He wraps her in the towel.]
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Morning.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A child's room. We see a mobile from which cut-out stars and planets dangle. The camera moves down, and we see Jack reading to Aaron.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack notices Kate smiling in the doorway.]
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[continues] But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Aha, that's the great puzzle."
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron has fallen asleep. Jack turns off the lamp and leaves. Kate closes the door. They stand in the hallway.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're a natural.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] Yeah?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My old man used to read me that story.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Really?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's just... it's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] I don't say nice things about my dad? Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that. Hey. You okay?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. Just, I... I love seeing you with him. I'm so glad you changed your mind. [Whispers] I'm so glad that you're here.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Whispers] Me, too.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss. He lifts her up and she laughs as he carries her down the hall.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Juliet and Bernard help Jack rest his head on a tree]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water. Give--give him some air, guys.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Grunts]
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You okay?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate arrives at the scene.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, what happened?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He passed out.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You fainted?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm fine. I'm just, uh... I'm just a little dehydrated.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, Jack. You're not okay. You're burning up.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... just need to get a little rest.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack-
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm fine.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Exhales deeply.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Claire, Miles and Aaron are trekking through the jungle on their way back to the beach camp.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh!
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You okay?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, just a bit woozy.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How's your head?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	It's better. Bit of a headache, but at least I'm not seeing things anymore.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah? What'd you see?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Back off, Donger.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron cries.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	I'm just making conversation.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let's make some time. I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight. If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Voices echo indistinctly, bullets whizz. Miles stops, concentrating on the sounds.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Alex's voice "no!"]
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gunshots, voices continue echoing indistinctly.]
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron fusses. Miles doesn't say anything.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey. Hey!
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Who's Danielle and Karl?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Y-you mean Rousseau? The French woman?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron cries. Miles begins digging in the ground. He comes across a face in the dirt, the body half buried.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Gasps] Oh, my God.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Insects buzzing.]
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Is this your French woman?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He begins digging a few feet away and uncovers another dead body, half buried.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Karl. How'd you know they were down there? Your buddies do this?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	They're not my buddies, man. I didn't sign up for this.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Can we just-can we just get out of here, please? Can we just go?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Whispers] Yeah, yeah, of course. But don't worry. Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine. All right? [Claire nods] Come on. Let's go.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron cries.]
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach camp, Jack is in his tent. Juliet enters.]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ahh. [Groans] I hate being sick.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What do you think it is?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's food poisoning.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What makes you think that?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I respectfully disagree.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] Do you?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You want to lift your shirt up?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack demurs.]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pauses and then lifts his shirt. Juliet presses, trying to assess his condition. Jack winces in pain.]
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's your appendix, Jack. When did the pain start?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yesterday.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Has it ruptured?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not yet.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Well... I guess we're just gonna have to take it out.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Do you remember where the medical station is or don't you?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes, I remember.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	These are the instruments that I need you to bring back. You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	"Clamps"? "Sutures"? Juliet, I don't know what these look like.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. Uh...
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I thought you were a physicist.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if-if-
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	We can't trust them.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[Scoffs] See, Dan? I told you. They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em. Might as well keep playing the part.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Damn it, Charlotte. That right there, that right there. Your-your attitude - your very bad attitude - it's exactly why they don't trust us. [Whispers] Come on. [Normal voice] Juliet, please. Don't blame us for-for this, for whatever is happening. We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt. We just wanna help. Please let us help.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet hands the supply list to Dan.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[To Jin, as she hands him a gun] If either of them tries to run, shoot 'em in the leg. Get back here as fast as you can.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Okay.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Thank you.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We need to create a sterile environment. Find a hard surface, wash it down, gather as many tarps as you can.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey Juliet. If everything that we need is at the medical station, then why don't we just bring Jack there?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Because if we move him, there's a good chance that his appendix will rupture. And if that happens, he's gonna die.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire, Aaron, Miles and Sawyer are by a creek. From a higher ledge, Miles looks down at Claire holding Aaron.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't even think about it.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	What?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't look at her. Don't talk to her. Don't mess with her. You got a restraining order. Twenty feet.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Zips up backpack.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	What are you, her big brother?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face unless you say, "Yeah, I getcha."
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah, I getcha.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the beach camp, Bernard sets down a table. Rose brings a bucket of water and a cloth.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay. An appendectomy is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	That's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking, "Why did he get sick?"
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Why? It's just-it's just bad luck.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	The day before we're all supposed to be rescued, the person that we count on the most suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition, and you're chalking it up to bad luck?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, what are you saying, that-that Jack did something to offend the gods? People get sick, Rose.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Not here. Here, they get better.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet shaves Jack's stomach.]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When was the last time you did this?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both chuckle.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	In my residency. I did a lot of 'em back then.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then you know the incision needs to be two inches lower than where you're shaving.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm just cleaning the area. Thank you.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I wanna talk you through it.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't want to be unconscious. We can use the lidocaine to numb the area. And then I can watch the procedure, help you out.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	And, uh, how are you gonna watch, flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We can use a mirror. Kate can hold it.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If someone's going to be in there, shouldn't it be someone with medical experience? Bernard's a dentist-
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I want it to be Kate.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack is walking with a patient in the lobby of the hospital.]
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't worry, Ms. Berenberg. You're in good hands.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS. BERENBERG	Thank you.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS. BERENBERG	Mm-hmm.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And remember, no solid food. Okay?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS. BERENBERG	Thank you, doctor.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Have a good evening.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack stops in his tracks. He sees what appears to be his father walking out of the building.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Jack? Jack?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack snaps out of it and turns to Erika.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Will you take a look at this X-ray? Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The L4. Yeah. Yeah.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RECEPTIONIST	Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you. It's a Dr. Stillman from Santa Rosa Hospital, says it's about a friend of yours.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sometime later, Jack and Dr. Stillman are walking down a hallway in the Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute.]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. STILLMAN	He's refusing to take his meds, and he's stopped sleeping.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What about his therapy sessions?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. STILLMAN	Therapy's... been rendered useless.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And why is that?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. STILLMAN	Because he doesn't think I exist.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keypad beeps, door unlocks. Hurley is sitting on the edge of his bed, gazing into space.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey Hurley.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[without looking at Jack] Hey Jack.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sits down.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why aren't you taking your meds?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	'Cause we're dead... all of us. All the Oceanic Six, we're all dead. We never got off that island.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley ... that is not true.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What'd you do today?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What did I do today? I, uh... [sighs] I woke up, took a shower. Uh, Kate and I fed the baby.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I thought you didn't want anything to do with Aaron.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I changed my mind after the trial.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Living with Kate... taking care of Aaron... it all seems so perfect... just like heaven.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just because I'm happy doesn't mean that this isn't real, Hurley.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I was happy too, Jack... for a while, anyway. Then I saw Charlie. [Jack looks rather flabbergasted] He likes to sit with me on the bench out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay. [Sighs] So what did the two of you talk about?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[skeptically] A message?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley opens a drawer and takes out a piece of paper.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up. [A tear rolls down his cheek] "You're not supposed to raise him, Jack." [Jack gets up and starts to leave] Does that make any sense?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, that... doesn't make any sense.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Do you think he means Aaron?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Take your meds, Hurley. Just take 'em.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He opens the door to leave.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, Jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you too. Soon.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sun, Jin, Daniel and Charlotte arrive outside the Staff station.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Sun	We're here.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin brushes off the plants covering the station's exterior. Charlotte opens the door and is about to go in before Dan grabs her arm.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Hey. Uh... why don't you let me go first? Um, you know, make sure everything's safe.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Okay. Be careful, Dan.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Absolutely.

466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The secret door to the medical lab makes a grinding sound across the floor as it slides open. The four enter the lab.]
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Where do you suppose all this power's coming from?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Add that one to the list, Dan. Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daniel and Charlotte begin rummaging for supplies. Sun takes interest in the examining table.]

488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Birds chirp as Sawyer, followed by Claire and Miles, trek through the dense jungle. Stepping underneath a fallen tree, Claire stumbles, her shoe falling off.]
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Whoa! Hey, you want a hand with the baby?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Dismissively] Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	You sure? I'm good with kids.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer turns back to threaten Miles.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What part of "restraining order" don't you understand?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They turn as they hear leaves rustling. Sawyer cocks his rifle.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Whispers] Get behind me, Claire.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear footsteps approaching. Sawyer points his gun in the direction of the sound. Frank Lapidus emerges from the foliage carrying an aviation first aid kit and a beeping satellite phone.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Whoa! Hey!
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who the hell are you?
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Lapidus?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Miles?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You two know each other?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	You gotta hide, man, right now.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	What?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Keamy's coming back, and if he sees you, he'll kill all of ya.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The pace of the sat-phone beeping picks up.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	And he's close, man. You gotta hide now! Go! Hide!
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs Claire's hand.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Just hide!
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on. Come on. Let's go!
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles follows them into a thicket, where they crouch down.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sat-phone beeping increases rapidly--then stops when Keamy and five other members of the freighter's military team step out of the jungle. One of them, badly wounded, is braced on the shoulders of two other men.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Where's the chopper?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	It's about a click back that way.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Did you bring the kit?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Yeah, it's right here. Jeez, man, he looks bad. What the hell happened?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	You do your job. I'll do mine.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy takes the first aid kit from Lapidus and hands it to the black mercenary. Birds chirp, and one high-pitched bird in particular. From hidden within the brush, Aaron makes a sound. Claire holds Aaron close against her. The high-pitched bird chirps again. Keamy looks around for the source of the noise.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Okay. It's gettin' dark, man. We gotta leave now.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer readies his gun to fire at Keamy should they be discovered.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Mr. Keamy, we gotta get back to the chopper.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Keamy, we gotta get back, 'cause I'll tell ya right now, I am not flying Faraday's bearings at night. I'm not gonna do it. So if you wanna get back, we gotta leave right now, sir.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Fine. You lead the way.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy gives up on his search for the noise.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Come on.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN 1	Okay.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN 2	Come on.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN 3	Watch it now.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The mercenaries leave with Lapidus. Sawyer and the others breathe a sigh of relief.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back on the beach, Juliet and Kate approach each other.]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The tent's all set. Everything's ready.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Good. Thanks. Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there. You wanna help me out?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's just holding a mirror. Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate chuckles.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm just surprised he's not taken it out of himself by now.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet smiles to herself. Jack emerges from the tent, stumbling.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack. What are you doin'?
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll help you.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack exhales sharply as Kate goes to assist him.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They're gonna be back with the instruments soon. We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back. See you in there.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet leaves.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs] Wouldn't be the first time.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate chuckles.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Listen, um... if something happens to me-
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Shut up, Jack.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] Fair enough.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A train horn blows in the distance. Jack sits in his Ford Bronco outside Santa Rosa Mental Health Facility at night. Jack stares at the table where Hurley said he met with Charlie. Jack starts the car and drives off.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack finds Kate asleep in bed.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate? Kate?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate stirs when Jack touches her.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wake up, Kate. Hey.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Sniffles] Hey. What time is it?
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's late. I just got home.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Were you working?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. I just... had to stop and get something. I just... took a while.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey. What's going on? What's wrong?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The other night, when I was reading to Aaron, you said... that I was a natural. (Sighs) Do you really... do you really think that I'm good at this?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. You're good at this.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Pauses] Will you marry me?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack removes a small box from his pocket and opens it. Kate gasps, tears in her eyes, and they both chuckle as he takes out the ring.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yes. [Laughs]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack puts the ring on her finger]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Of course I will. Yes.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss, laugh and hug.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[It's nighttime on the beach. Juliet lights a torch on the campfire and hands it to Bernard.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Look, they're back.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet runs to Daniel and Charlotte.]
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Did you find everything?
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Yes, ma'am. The entire list. Is he okay?
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	For now. Sun, we need to sterilize these. There's a pot of water boiling over here.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet, Dan and Sun move off.]

688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet activates a makeshift surgery lamp by turning on four flashlights bound together and hung from the ceiling of a tent. Kate ties her hair back. Bernard flicks the bubbles out of a syringe of local anesthetic. He swabs an area on Jack's lower right abdomen.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	You know, Jack, they found some chloroform at the medical station. I could knock you out. Wouldn't you rather be dreaming about something nice back home?
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I'll manage with the lidocaine.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grunts as Bernard injects him with the anesthetic at several sites and he adjusts the mirror Kate holds for him.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just hold it right there.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Okay, now this is gonna numb the area of the first incision. After that, I would like to be able to tell you you' not gonna feel a thing, but... you will.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You ready?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet snaps the latex gloves over her hands.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay. Here we go.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet begins the incision into Jack's flesh. Jack grunts. She continues. He grunts again, and again.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay, Jack. One more.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh!
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay, try not to move.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grunts.]
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Just stay still. [To Bernard] Spreader.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, I-I can't see it.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sorry.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Don't worry about the mirror. Just stay still. [To Bernard] Spreader.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Groaning] That's good. That's good. Yeah. This is it. That's good.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet inserts the spreader and clicks it open.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Aah! [Grunting loudly]
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Knock him out, Bernard.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard moves to get the chloroform.]
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No! No... not wanna be unconscious.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You don't want to be out of control.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kate, you need to leave.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Bernard!
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate-
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kate, you need to go.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	-please.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Bernard!
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard's still busy getting the chloroform.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No!
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kate, get out of here! Bernard.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate...
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kate. Kate, get outta here! Damn it, Bernard! Knock him out!
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grunts a final "No!" as Bernard holds the cloth over his mouth and nose. Everything goes.]
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A bright white screen. We're looking at a backlit X-ray examination board. Jack puts a new film into place showing a spine, and begins dictating into a recorder.]
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Laker, Ryan. Patient is male, 36.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hears a distant beep.]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Osteoblastoma is present in the posterior area of the lumbar. I am recommending biopsy for-
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another beep. And a third. Jack puts down his work, exits his office. Another beep. He closes the door and walks down the hallway. The beeping continues. He looks up at the source: a rogue smoke alarm placed over the reception desk of the Neurosurgery Group at St. Sebastian Hospital. Jack scrapes a chair across the floor, gets up on it, and up on the desk to reach the smoke alarm. He extracts the battery to end the beeping, putting the thing out of its misery, then gets down from the desk and examines the battery. A voice out of nowhere startles him]
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Jack?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack jumps and turns around. There, sitting on a couch in the waiting area, is his father, Christian Shepard, wearing the suit he was to be buried in and white sneakers. Jack slowly moves closer to his father, who sits up. A dark figure comes up behind Jack.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Jack?
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gasps and turns around. It's Dr. Erika Stevenson, a co-worker of Jack's in the Neurosurgery Group. She looks to the couch in the waiting area. Jack looks there too, but no one is there. He sighs deeply.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	You okay?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh, yeah. I'm-I'm... I'm okay. I, uh... I just, uh...
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Erika looks on, concerned. Jack holds his head, and holds back tears.]
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The, um, the smoke detector was... was beeping, and I just...
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Okay. Thank you for keeping us safe.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She begins to leave.]
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Erika, um... [sighs] Do you mind doing me a favor?
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Yeah, sure.
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Can you write a script for... clonazepam?
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	For you?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, um... I just got a lot going on right now, and I'm just a little snowed under with all my caseload, and Kate and I got engaged. Just... not sleepin' very well at night, you know? Just...
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Erika takes out her prescription pad and scribbles on it. She rips the paper off the pad and hands Jack his script.]
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thank you.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	You know, getting engaged is supposed to help reduce stress, not create it.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. [Chuckles] You're right.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Maybe you should talk to someone.
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll do that.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ERIKA	Good night.
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good night.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack arrives home. He hears Kate's voice. She's on the phone in the kitchen.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I'll just have the nanny stay for an extra couple hours. Jack's never home before 8:00 anyway. I could stay for at least an hour. [Keys jangle] I--I gotta go. Jack's home. Yeah, okay. I'll call you later. Bye.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The phone beeps as Kate hangs up.]
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey. You scared me.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gets herself a glass of water from the filter pitcher in the refrigerator.]
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed. Who was that?
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That was Noreen.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Noreen?
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. She's one of the moms from the park. What?
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nothing. I just... never heard you mention her before.
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, now you have.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She leans up to kiss Jack on the lips.]
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll see you upstairs.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate goes up to bed. Jack fishes into his jacket pocket and extracts his clonazepam prescription. Dropping his keys on the counter, he takes the pill bottle out of the Skadden's Pharmacy envelope, opens the bottle, and takes out two round white pills. He goes to the refrigerator - which is covered with colorful construction-paper art of ladybugs and flowers - and takes out a bottle of Penzburg beer. He twists off the cap, pops the pills in his mouth, and chugs down the beer.]
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Crickets chirp and a campfire crackles in the jungle. Miles is fast asleep. Sawyer snores. Claire stirs awake. Aaron is gone. She looks up to see a white-haired man rocking the baby in his arms. It's Christian Shephard. Claire gasps.]
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Dad?
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nighttime at the beach. Surf rolling in distance. Kate sits worried. Bernard approaches.]
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Hey. Don't worry. It went well. She did good. She said you could go back inside if you want to.
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Sniffles] Thank you.
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Okay.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the tent, Juliet is using black thread to stitch up Jack's wound. Kate enters.]
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He didn't lose that much blood. I got the appendix out and put everything back where it belongs, I think.
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate chuckles.]
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So he's gonna be okay?
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He should be fine. We just have to talk him into resting.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Good luck with that.
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Laughs.]
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm sorry I yelled at you.
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't worry about it. You had enough going on.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You know, he kissed me.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	The other day, when you came back from the other side of the Island, Jack kissed me.
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Oh.
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It was nice... but it wasn't for me. It was for him. I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Prove what?
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	That he doesn't love someone else.
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They look at each other.]
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thank you, Juliet. Thank you for saving his life.
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate leaves.]
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I know you're awake.
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack opens his eyes.]
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack is sitting on the couch, twiddling a ring, when Kate arrives home.]
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey. You're home early. Where's Veronica?
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I sent her home. The baby's asleep.
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Sighs] Good.
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She sits down. Ice cubes rattle as Jack picks up his drink]
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why was she here?
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sorry?
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The nanny. She only works 'til 4:00. I came home at 6:00.
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I had to run some errands, so... [sets keys down] I asked her to stay a couple extra hours. What's going on, Jack? Why are you home so early?
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I went to see Hurley.
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Today?
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Last... Friday.
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you.
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Laughs] Because he's crazy, Kate, and I didn't wanna upset you. [Sighs] Where were you today?
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She gets up and kneels in front of him.]
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm gonna ask you... to trust me. Trust me. Just leave it be.
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs] Where were you?
948	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Whispers] Jack, don't.
950	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I heard you on the phone last night. Who were you talking to?
952	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Just let it go.
954	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She starts to walk away.]
956	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, no, I wanna know.
958	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He gets up.]
960	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, Jack.
962	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I wanna know where you were. I wanna know who you were with.
964	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It doesn't matter, Jack. Please.
966	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, tell me. Tell me!
968	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Sighs] I was doing something for him.
970	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	For who?
972	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	For Sawyer. I made him a promise. It... [sighs]
974	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs] What?
976	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with us.
978	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then why won't you tell me?
980	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because-because he wouldn't want me to.
982	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tears fill her eyes.]
984	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	But he's not here, is he? No. No, he made his choice. He chose to stay. I'm the one who came back. I'm the one who's here. I'm the one who saved you.
986	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack. [Sniffles] You can't--you can't do this. If you have problems, you need to figure them out. All right? 'Cause I can't have you like this around my son.
988	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Your son? You're not even related to him!
990	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She gasps.]
992	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They turn to the hallway. Aaron has awoken and is standing there holding a stuffed whale. Kate walks over to him.]
994	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, sweet pea. Hey.
996	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She looks at Jack with tears in her eyes. He looks at her and Aaron and then walks away.]
998	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Miles is tending the fire. Sawyer wakes up.]
1000	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Morning.
1002	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's way too early for Chinese. [Grunts] Where's Claire? Ladies' room?
1004	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Nope. She just walked off into the jungle.
1006	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What? When?
1008	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	In the middle of the night. Just got up and left.
1010	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You let her go alone?
1012	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	She wasn't alone.
1014	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, who was she with?
1016	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	She called him "Dad". I'd have followed them, but I have a restraining order.
1018	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He chuckles. Sawyer grabs Miles and just when he's about to hit him with the handle of his gun, Aaron's cries in distance are heard.]
1020	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Claire! Claire!
1022	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer runs toward the cries, eventually finding Aaron balanced on a large plant at the base of a tree.]
1024	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's okay. It's okay. I've got you.
1026	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron is crying.]
1028	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Claire! CLAIRE!
1030	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron continues crying.]
1032	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	CLAIRE! CLAIRE!!!
