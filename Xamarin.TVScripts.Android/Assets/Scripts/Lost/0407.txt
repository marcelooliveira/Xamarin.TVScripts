20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REGINA	[startled] Frank! [distracted] I didn't hear you.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Sorry, I didn't mean to spook you. Captain wanted me to bring these guys some grub... you know your book's upside down.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She gives him a look and turns the book around.]

30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Thought I'd check in on you guys and bring you some food. [to Desmond] How are you feeling by the way?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Yeah, much better, thanks.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why are we being held captive? We had nothing to do with Minkowski's death.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	This has nothing to do with Minkowski. The captain wasn't very happy that you two decided to bust out of sick bay and into our radio room.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We didn't bust out. The door was left open! We assumed that was you.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Why the hell would I do that?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Did you have any contact with our people on the beach?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	No luck. Something must have happened to the phone.

48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Lima beans?
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Sorry, we had a little problem in the kitchen. Just stay put, alright?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I still want to talk to the captain.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	No, you don't.

170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I guess she didn't wanna have to explain why she was on her way to a poison gas factory. Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Why would Juliet lie about that?

178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	To turn it off, to deactivate the gas. I guess they wanted to earn some brownie points.

198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's a note. Three days ago, when I was in Locke's camp, Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.

216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	It's a simple question. Are you or are you not going to rescue us?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	The thing is... um, it's not really my call, Sun.

408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, he wouldn't.

440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jin. Your wife had an affair.

444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	What?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Sun was with another man. She thought the baby was his.

490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Yeah, well, no, not to each other. No. [laughing] You got it. It's not easy, is it? Oh, I mean, it's--it's wonderful, but... let's face it, every decision that you make takes twice as long. 'Cause you always gotta talk them into it. [pause] Rose... has cancer. She's sick. Dying. Well, at least, she 'was' dying. She says she's better now. She says it's this place... the island. But when the camp split up, I was sure that she'd want to go with Locke. Why would she want to leave the island, and risk getting sick again?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Then why do you stay with Jack?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Because it was the right thing to do. Locke... he's a murderer. See, it's all about karma, Jin. Do you know karma?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin nods.]

510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How long's that gonna go on for, eh? Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That sound is not mechanical.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What, you think somebody's doing that? Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That's exactly what I think.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ray enters.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Gentlemen, thanks for your patience. The captain would like to see you now.

526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	Lapidus is running an errand.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What kind of errand?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Did he go to the island?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	You know anywhere else he could land?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond notices Regina on the second-level deck, as she walks draped in chains.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's he going to do there?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	I said I'm just a doctor.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What did Lapidus say?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAY	He didn't say anything to me.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[frustrated] What is he doing there?!
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Regina is about to jump off the side of the freighter. Desmond runs toward her.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey! Hey!
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Regina jumps; Desmond and Sayid go over to look at her.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The crew do not seem interested.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Don't just stand there! What's the matter with you people?!
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's wrong with you? Get the rope!
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why aren't you doing anything?!
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Captain Gault comes.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Bring a rope!
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Get a rope!
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND and SAYID	Get a rope!
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	Stop!
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	She just jumped!
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	It's over! She's gone! Everybody get back to your posts. That was an order.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gault approaches Desmond and Sayid.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	I'm Captain Gault. I suppose you two have a few questions.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the freighter.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	So what can I do for you?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	You boys said you wanted to speak with me.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Let's just start with why a woman jumped over the side of your ship, and you did nothing to stop it.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	I didn't jump in, or order my crew to jump in, because I didn't want to lose any more people.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What exactly is going on here?
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	Some of my crew has been dealing with... what might best be described as a heightened case of cabin fever. I think it's got something to do with the close proximity of the island.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why don't you turn around, then?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board, and he's done one hell of a job on my engines. I've got my crew working around the clock to repair them.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And then you'll take our people home?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	Then we move to safer waters... those are my orders.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	Sure, I will. Charles Widmore.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	This is Charles Widmore's boat?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	That's right. You know him.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gault leads Sayid and Desmond into the captain's stateroom. Gault gets a metal box out of a cabinet, and puts it on the table.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	Do either of you know what this is?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAULT	That's exactly what it is. Now here's the funny thing. This black box comes from Oceanic Flight 815. A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean. It took a considerable amount of Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it. It was found with the wreckage of the plane, along with all 324 dead passengers. [to Sayid] That's not the complete story, as you are well aware, Mr. Jarrah, given the fact that you're standing here, breathing... the wreckage was obviously staged. Now can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude? Faking the recovery of a plane crash? Putting 324 families through a grieving process based on a lie? But what's even more disturbing... where exactly does one come across 324 dead bodies? And that, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. Hume, is just one of the many reasons we want Benjamin Linus.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the beach, Juliet comes to Sun and sits beside her.]
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm sorry. I had to stop you any way I could.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	It wasn't your place to stop us.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I know you don't trust me, but you need to get off this island. We all do.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	You want to leave?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	More than anything. I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not, but it's something. I need to go home. So do you. Sun... in about three weeks, you'll be in an almost constant state of nausea. A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath that won't go away. A week after that, you will lose consciousness and slip into a coma. And then, Sun, you will die. And when your heart stops beating... so will the baby's. And that, Sun, is why it is my business, because you are my patient. If you go... you will die. And your baby will never be born.
