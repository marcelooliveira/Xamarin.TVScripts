6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet rakes a miniature Zen rock garden in Harper Stanhope's psychological therapy office.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. You must be Dr. Burke.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Juliet.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Juliet. I'm Harper Stanhope. Please sit. Today is just a meet and greet so that we can get to know each other.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Please don't take this the wrong way, but I-I really don't think I need therapy.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	How about we call it "talking" instead of therapy?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Good.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Clicks pen.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Let's talk. So you've been here a week. And what's your least favorite part so far?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I don't like being treated like a celebrity.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	And is that surprising? You're big news right now.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yes, I know. I guess I don't like being the center of attention. It makes me feel isolated ... alone. (Chuckles nervously)
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Well, maybe you feel that all eyes are on you, but you're not a celebrity, and soon enough, you'll realize that you're no different than anyone here.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh, I-I know. I-I never meant that I-
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Knock on door.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Yes?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tom enters.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption. I know you don't like me busting in, but Ben would like to see the doc.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Uh... She's all yours, Tom. It was nice talking to you, Juliet. Welcome to the Island.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tom chuckles as he walks Juliet through the Barracks.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	That Harper's a piece of work. [Chuckles] But you give her a week, she'll have you cryin' about your daddy. I'm speaking from personal experience here. [Laughs]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[laughs]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben stands on a porch holding flowers.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Welcome to your humble abode.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	This is for me? The whole house?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You're here to help us with some very important research, Juliet. We pulled out all the stops. Two bedrooms, two baths. Washer, dryer. Fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Laughs]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Oh, and I know you love the opera. You have all the classics on CD.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Ben, this is amazing. Seriously, you shouldn't have gone to all the trouble. I'm only gonna be here for six months.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Right, of course. But... we want you to feel at home.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Later, at the beach camp, Juliet attempts to re-earth the pole of her shelter.]
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Grunts.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Thunder rumbling.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Need some help?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm fine. I just can't seem to get it steady.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Both grunt.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Okay.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun sighs.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Nice. Thanks.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Why are you going to all this trouble when we're about to leave this island?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Well, I still need somewhere to sleep tonight, right?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet. [Panting] Have you seen Charlotte and Faraday? All their stuff's gone.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No, I haven't seen them. You still have the sat phone, right?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Æ’Â¬Ã«Â¡Â¯Ã­â€¢ËœÃªÂ³ Ã­Å’Â¨Ã«Å¸Â¬Ã«ÂÂ°Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å â€ Ã¬Â â€¢ÃªÂ¸â‚¬Ã«Â¡Å“ Ã«â€œÂ¤Ã¬â€“Â´ÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â¸ Ã«Â´Â¤Ã«Å â€Ã«ÂÂ°.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	He saw them going into the jungle.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why didn't he say anything?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â„¢Å“ Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«Â¬Â´Ã­â€¢Å“Ã­â€¦Å’Ã«Ââ€ž Ã¬â€“ËœÃªÂ¸Â° Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã­â€“Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Å¡â€?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	You said... they are friends.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sighs.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Aren't they?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hands out torches as it begins to rain.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All right, we've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's fan out. If you cut their trail, call out to me. I'll come to you.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Thunder crashes.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[thunder rumbling.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet wanders alone in the jungle.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[ghostly voices whispering.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[ghostly whispering continues.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet turns around to see Harper Stanhope standing behind her, alone in the jungle, watching her. Juliet gasps.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Hello, Juliet. Long time no see.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What are you doing here?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	I came to deliver a message... from Ben. The two people you're looking for - Faraday and Lewis - they're headed to the Tempest. And if they figure out how to deploy that gas... then everyone on this island is going to die.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why don't you stop them?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Because Ben wants you to go.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	How can Ben possibly know where they are when he's a prisoner?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Ben is exactly where he wants to be.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	How am I supposed to stop them?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	By pointing the gun and pulling the trigger.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey!
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack comes up and cocks his gun.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who are you?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	I'm an old friend of Juliet's. I just told her where the people you're looking for are headed. Maybe you and your gun can go too.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ghostly voices whispering.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Whispering stops.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Juliet are distracted, and look around for the source of the whispers. When they turn back around, Harper has vanished.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet cries softly to herself amongst the supply shelves in a medical office in the Barracks. She hears a clatter in the next room and walks over.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You okay?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Uh, I was just looking for some gauze. I-I didn't know anyone was here.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goodwin reveals an ugly-looking burn on his arm.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	How'd you manage that?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	I, um... I-I work over at the power station. I was pressed up against the transformer.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Take a seat. Let me take a look at it.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He sits and she examines the wound.]
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	You're Burke, right? The baby doctor.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What gave me away?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Objects settle on table.]
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	I heard we lost Henrietta this morning. It's okay. It's not your fault.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Pregnant women are dying on this island. I was brought here to help fix that. So whose fault is it?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Believe me, nobody expects you to fix it overnight.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sniffles.]
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	You have anyone to talk to? Any friends here? Maybe Harper.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Harper hates me. [Sniffles] We only talk because we have to. I get the feeling that she is a mean... and spiteful person.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	She's my wife.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	She's your wife? I'm sorry. I didn't-
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	No, don't worry about it. Really, it's okay.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay, you're, uh, you're set.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Much obliged, ma'am.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet turns away.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Hey. I know this place can wear on you, but if you need to talk... I'm around.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Good to know. Oh, um... if you promise not to tell your wife what I said about her, I won't tell anyone that you lied about how you hurt your arm. I know a chemical burn when I see one.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goodwin chuckles.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	You got a deal. Uh, by the way... I'm Goodwin.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Juliet.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goodwin leaves through the door.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Juliet and Jack are walking through the jungle in the rain.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Faraday and Charlotte are heading for the Tempest.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The Tempest?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's safer for you if I don't talk about it.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. Talk about it, please.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's an electrical station that powers the Island.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why would they go there?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack stops Juliet.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. If there's something you need to tell me, now's the time to do it.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What I need is for you to help me. Will you help me?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She looks imploringly at Jack. Jack resignedly looks to the ground.]
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If we move all night, maybe we can still catch them. Thank you.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[It's morning. Dan and Charlotte are crouching at a stream in the jungle. Dan is looking at a map.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Birds chirping.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	I think it's that way. But what happens if I... what if I can't do it?
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Dan. Look at me. I know you can do this. Should we get going?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Yeah.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Come on.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks out of the bushes and Charlotte draws her gun.]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's-it's okay. It's okay. It's Kate.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte lowers her gun.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate fills up her water bottle in the stream.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	So they have Miles?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, but he's fine. They're treating him fine. I thought you two were with Jack at the beach. What are you guys doing out here?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Jack was trying to communicate with Sayid and Desmond on the freighter, but their sat phone ran out of juice. It's totally dead. There's no way we can call the boat.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate notices the sat phone sticking out of Charlotte's backpack, its green power light brightly lit.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	So we volunteered to get the spare batteries out of the packs that we threw out of the chopper.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So... if you threw your pack from the chopper, what's that?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate indicates Dan's bag.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	This? Uh... it's... just borrowed this.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Mind if I take a look?
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Go ahead, Dan. Show her.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daniel allows Kate to open his bag. She finds gas masks in it, and holds one up.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Batteries, huh? What's this for-
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte pistol-whips Kate, knocking her out.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	-uhh!
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dan looks at Charlotte.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	What?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Juliet are hiking through the jungle.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That woman--what was her name?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Harper.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The two of you friends?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Not exactly. She was my therapist.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You people had therapists?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's very stressful being an Other, Jack.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Seemed kinda hostile, even for a therapist.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm sure there are things from your past that you'd rather not talk about.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. You read them all in my file.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Trust me, Jack. You don't want to see my file.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - At the medical office in the Barracks, Ben gazes at Juliet as she peers into in a microscope.]
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	The problem occurs somewhere during the second trimester, when the mother's immune system is triggered. The white blood cell count plummets. It's like the... immune system turns on the fetus.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	May I?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Sure.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He looks into the microscope and puts his hand on the table. She nervously removes her hand from near his.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Any thought yet on a cause?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Mm, it's really too early to tell, but only women who've conceived on the Island does it happen to-
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The door opens.]
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	-which makes me wonder-
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goodwin pokes his head in the doorway.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Hey Juliet. Oh, Ben, I didn't know you were here. Ethan's out sick.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goodwin rustles a paper lunch bag.]
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	I have an extra egg salad on rye. I was just checking to see if Juliet wants it.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Thanks. No, I already ate. Oh, besides, I have an appointment with your wife in 10 minutes.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet looks at Ben.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Great. Tell her I said hi.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh, will do.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Ben?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, I'm fine.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The door creaks and shuts. Ben goes back to looking in the microscope.]
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet sits on the couch is in Harper's office.]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	So, Juliet, what do you think of Ben?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He's great. Uh, very smart... and intense. Challenging. He's been really good to me.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Of course he has. You look just like her.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm sorry?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	And I see you and my husband have become friendly.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet looks worried. She pauses.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yeah. He's great. He's been really helpful.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	When did you start sleeping with him?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Look, Juliet, I'm not an idiot. So just tell me. When did it start?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay. [Stammers] I'm not doing this. We're done.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She stands up, as does Harper.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	No. Please respect me enough to spare me the pretense that you are actually offended. I know. I followed you. Watched you.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Whispers] I'm sorry.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	It doesn't matter anymore. But what does matter is that you listen to me and that you believe me. And if you continue to have a relationship with Goodwin, there will be consequences. I don't want him to get hurt.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I would never hurt him.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HARPER	Look it, I am not talking about you. I am talking about Ben.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Outside the Barracks, Locke dresses a recently slaughtered rabbit. Claire approaches, carrying Aaron.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hi John.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey Claire. Is there something I can do for you?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I want to know what's going on with Miles.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Right now, not a whole lot. I'm ... bringing him food and water until he decides to talk.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I'd like to talk to him myself.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Sets knife down] And why would you want to do that?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	John, we have to find out who these people are and where they came from. And why they're not interested in rescuing us.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And you don't think I'm gonna get that out of him?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No, I... I just think we might be taking the wrong approach. I mean, you killed one, Ben shot one, and now we're holding one prisoner. You know, it's not hard to understand why they might think we're hostile. I might be just a little less intimidating.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's not gonna happen, Claire.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	John, I don't-
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You do remember what Charlie said about these people.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	All Charlie said was whose boat it isn't. Don't you wanna know whose boat it is?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke slams his knife on the table.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben sits on the floor of his cell in the basement prison of his Barracks house, reading VALIS. He hears the sound of keys opening the door. Locke enters with a plate of food. Ben gets up with a sigh and takes the plate Locke hands him.]
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Rabbit today?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We're running out of chickens.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	This didn't have a number on it, did it?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben shakes his head.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Eat, change, put your laundry and dishes by the door. I'll be back to collect them in 15 minutes.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke starts to leave. Ben pipes up as he begins eating the rabbit.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	So has the revolution begun yet? Or...
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The door creaks shut, but Locke peeks back in, interested.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you talking about?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, you're the leader now. I know it's a tough position. You have to deal with all those people constantly second-guessing your decisions, and it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it? A question here, a comment there, and then if you're not careful, you find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands. Believe me, your people are gonna be so angry when they realize you still don't have a plan.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And I assume you have a plan.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I always have a plan.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Does it involve you raising $3.2 million? Phew. That's a lot of money. Wait.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke removes a dollar bill from his pocket, uncrumples it, and hands it to Ben.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Maybe this'll get you started. Put your laundry and dishes by the door.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke turns to leave again.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I can help you, John. We have shared interests... or at least a common enemy.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And that would be our friends on the freighter.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Not them. The one they work for. Let me out of here. Give me some semblance of freedom, let me sleep in a bed and eat with utensils, and I give you my word I'll tell you everything you want to know about the person who sent the freighter.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, but see, there's the problem. I don't trust your word.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	All right, then. I guess I'll have to show you.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet's head pokes out of the water near the shore. She emerges, wearing a bikini top and swimming trunks. Goodwin relaxes on a picnic blanket on the sandy beach. He tosses her a towel and opens a bottle of wine.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	I hope this is good. [Grunts] I don't know much about wine. I swiped this off the sub.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Chuckles]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	There.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Thanks. [Clink] Mmm.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet smiles and relaxes her head against Goodwin's back.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	I wish we could do this all the time. I hate that we have to be so... private.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What's the matter with being private?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	[Sighs] It's ridiculous. I've been sleeping on the couch for a year. Why am I not just telling her?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I don't think it's a good idea.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goodwin rises.]
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Why not?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Ben wouldn't like it.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	That's what this is about? You're worried about Ben? Why? Because he has a crush on you?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You know?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Come on. Everyone knows. He follows you around like a puppy.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	And you don't think that's a problem?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	[Sighs] Now a little less than a kilometer from here, he has me working with chemicals, that could kill every man, woman and child on this island if I flip the wrong switch. Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate. The last thing he cares about is you and me.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I just... get the feeling that he would be upset.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	What's Ben gonna do?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sound of jet engines and explosions fill the air as Oceanic Flight 815 breaks up in the sky over the Barracks. Ben watches from the ground, shading his eyes from the sun.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Goodwin! You see where the tail landed?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOODWIN	Yeah, probably in the water.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You run, you can make that shore in an hour. [Goodwin and Juliet exchange a look] Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em - a passenger. You're in shock. Come up with an adequate story if they ask.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Harper steps up from behind Goodwin. She casts a look at Juliet.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet looks back at Harper.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Jack and Juliet trek through the jungle.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Something's wrong. We should've... we should've caught up with 'em by now.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	These people base jumped out of a helicopter, Jack. Let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear Kate groaning. Jack runs to find her on the ground.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Hey. [Kate groans] It's all right. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. It's all right. Come on. Take it easy. [Whispers] Take it easy.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'll go get her some water.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Thanks.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gasping.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What happened?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Panting] I was going back to the beach, and... I ran into Faraday and that woman... um... Charlotte. I think she hit me.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They disappeared out of camp last night. We've been trying to catch up with them.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do you know where they were headed?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Some sort of...power station.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack. They had gas masks.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks around for Juliet, but she's gone.]
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet? Juliet?! Juliet! Juliet!
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Barracks, Locke leads Ben, who is tied at the hands, through Ben's own Barracks living room.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All right, no tricks. You're not leading me out into the jungle so you can disappear or shoot me in the back.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No tricks, John. We don't even have to leave the living room.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So let's have it.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We have a deal, right?
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How do I know you're not gonna run off and meet your people first chance you get?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Smirks] If my people still wanted me, John, they would've stormed this camp long ago. It's behind that picture.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke goes to a hanging picture and unhinges it to reveal a safe with a combination lock.]
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	36-15-28.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke turns the dial and the lock clicks. He opens the safe to find a single cassette tape. It's labeled "Red Sox."]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	"Red Sox"?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I taped over the game.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A minute later, Locke inserts the tape into a VCR and he and Ben sit down to watch on an old TV. The tape whirs in the machine. The tape shows a well-dressed balding man exit a limousine. The video is taken from above, with intermittent occlusion, as if being shot covertly by someone hidden above.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	This is Charles Widmore. This is the man whose boat is parked offshore. This is the man that's been trying to find the Island.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the TV screen, a henchman removes a blindfolded man from the limousine trunk and walks him to the first man.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Who's the man in the blindfold?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	One of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How does Widmore know about the Island?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I don't know, but he does.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What does he want?
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	John, three months ago in Gainesville, Florida, the Virgin Mary seemed to appear in a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex. When the word got out, over 5,000 people came to see her face for themselves. You've survived an airline crash on this island. One minute, you're in a wheelchair. The next minute, you're doing jumping jacks. If 5,000 people came out to see a piece of mold, how many people do you think would come here to see you? Charles Widmore wants to exploit this island, and he'll do everything in his power to possess it.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the tape, Widmore beats the blindfolded man with his fists. When he finishes, he looks up, apparently noticing the handywork of the concealed cameraman. With a static hissing, the picture turns to snow noise. Ben gets up and goes back to the safe, removing a file folder, filled thick with papers.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Everything I know about Charles Widmore is in this file. Some of it's vague, some of it's guesswork, some of it's concrete. But this is everything, and now it's all yours. [Pauses] I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this sooner. But it was the only bargaining chip I had left.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	There's one more thing I need to know. Your man on the boat...I want you to tell me who it is.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Alright. But you might want to sit down.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate removes leaves from the jungle floor, examining tracks.]
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She came through here. So did they, about half an hour ahead of her.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What happened?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sorry?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	At Locke's - why did you stay?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I stayed because I had to find something out.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you gonna tell me, or are we gonna keep walking through the jungle like it doesn't matter?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They stop.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I stayed to find out if the people on the freighter know who I am... if they knew that I'm a fugitive... that I'm wanted for murder.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do they?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, they know... we should keep moving. God knows where Juliet is.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet approaches a concrete bunker entrance high on a hill, panting from the climb. She notes that the electric door switch has been destroyed, and manually moves the counterweight to open the huge bunker door, which opens with a clank. She enters, and leaving her bag by the door, she draws her gun and steps inside.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Ben opens a door with a happy look on his face, then turns away.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hi. Come on in. Sorry. I have to get this ham out of the oven, or it'll dry out.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He goes to the oven. We're in his house in the Barracks. Juliet steps inside, holding a basket of rolls]
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Please. Don't mind me. How are you feeling, by the way?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Never better.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben removes the ham with oven mitts.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It smells delicious.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet looks at the table, set for two, as Ben removes a plate of hot potatoes, carrots and lettuce from the oven.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Ben, I thought this was a dinner party.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Just you and me. Oh, I guess I should've made that clearer.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He walks over to her.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	... No. It's fine. I-I hope you like dinner rolls.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She hands him a large basket of them.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I do indeed.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He smiles, taking the rolls. Juliet peers around, befuddled.]
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Later that evening, Juliet sits at Ben's table as he carves the ham.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I want to thank you for how wonderful you've been with Zack and Emma.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They're really sweet kids. [Ben chuckles] Ben, they've been asking me about their mother in Los Angeles. I'm not really sure what to say.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	They'll stop asking in time.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They're children. Do they really belong here?
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	They're on the list, Juliet.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben hands Juliet her serving.]
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Now that we have everyone on the list from the tail section, what about Goodwin?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben stops carving, then continues.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He's been undercover for three weeks.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Stops carving]...[Resumes carving] He's making a case for this woman, Ana Lucia. [Utensils clattering] He thinks she'd be a valuable member of our society. But between you and me, I don't see it. He feels very passionately about her, almost inappropriately so.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	After losing Ethan, it's a risk.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Goodwin stays where he's at right now, Juliet. There's no reason for him to hurry back, right? But his assignment will be over soon. I promise you.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - in a dimly lit hallway of the Tempest, an alarm blares and red lights flash.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Warning. Computer switching to manual operation. This attempt is unauthorized.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet comes out of the hallway into a two-level complex, with computer equipment on the level below her. A figure in a hazmat suit stands before a terminal, tapping away at the keyboard. The alarm sounds again.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Warning - manual entry override denied.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Error messages flash on the screen as the figure enters commands into prompts at lightning speed.]
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Warning - manual entry override denied.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet finds some stairs and goes down to the lower level.]
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Repeated attempts to access storage tanks will result in contamination.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The alarm sounds again.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Repeated attempts to access storage tanks-
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet approaches the suited figure and points her gun at him.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Hey.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	-will result in contamination.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The suited figure whirls around, startled. It's Dan. His voice muffles, filtered, through a gas mask.]
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Juliet. What are you doing here?
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Final warning - manual override failed.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Step away from the computer.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	I'm so sorry. I can't do that.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Manual override failed. Countermeasures will begin.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dan turns back to the terminal and continues entering commands.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Hey!
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet pulls off Daniel's gas mask and it falls to the floor. She points her gun at him. The alarm blares.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	One minute to contamination.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You want to release the gas? You'll die with the rest of us.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	No, no. I-I'm not trying to release it. I'm trying to - I'm trying to render it inert. Juliet, I just want to make it safe.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A second suited figure hits Juliet from behind, on the back, hard, with a metal pipe. Juliet is knocked to the ground. The gun slides across the floor.]
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Uhh!
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	40 seconds to contamination.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dan returns to the terminal, furiously entering commands. Grunting, Charlotte strikes again, just as Juliet tries to reach for the gun. Juliet flies at Charlotte, tackling her into a cart of files and equipment. The alarm continues to blare. Juliet, on top of Charlotte, struggles to remove Charlotte's gas mask, but Charlotte punches at her and finally kicks her away.]
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	30 seconds to contamination.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte flies at Juliet and the struggle continues on the ground. An indicator on the monitor rises into the red zone.]
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Aah! [Grunts]
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[An alarm continues blaring. The alarm sounds.]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Warning - contamination imminent. Evacuate immediately.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte tries to pin Juliet on the ground as they fight.]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Aah!
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Hey!
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[An alarm continues blaring. Juliet unmasks Charlotte, distracting her long enough to reach for the gun, just beyond her fingertips. Grunting, she punches Charlotte off of her. Charlotte's body hits into some equipment and she falls to the floor.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Stop!
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The alarm continues blaring and error messages continue to appear on the monitor as Dan's rapid typing on the keyboard persists. Juliet stands up with the gun and points it at the defeated Charlotte. The clock on the screen goes past 20.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	20 seconds to contamination.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rapid beeping.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Whatever he's doing, tell him to stop.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	We're trying to disable it before he can use it against us!
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte pulls off her hood and sits up.]
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Juliet... look me in the eye and tell me you are certain that Benjamin Linus wouldn't use this gas to kill everyone on this island! We know he's used it before. If you want to stop us, you're going to have to shoot us both.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	10 seconds to contamination.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Daniel!
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Yeah, yeah! I'm trying!
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He continues typing commands in desperately.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	Come on.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The alarm blares rapidly.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE	Contamination in 5... 4... 3... 2...
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[With one second left, the alarm stops. The computer screen returns Daniel's final, successful, commands: "set valve BC22 = open" with the message "VALVE BC22 REPORTS OPEN", and "master caution reset", with the message "MASTER CAUTION RESET - SYSTEM PRESSURE WITHIN NORM PARAM - TANK INTEGRITY TESTS REPORT SECURE". An electrical whirring slows, powering down. Daniel's rapid typing stops. He looks around. Juliet lowers her gun. A loud mechanical hissing indicates the relief of pressure of gasses. The indicator on the bar on the monitor descends from the red into the green. A deep, descending electrical humming. Charlotte laughs nervously. Daniel pants, chuckles.]
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAN	That... that was a close one.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet wipes her face.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Juliet is at a desk inside the Barracks' medical office. Ben enters through the door.]
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What are you reading?
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Shephard's file. Mikhail dropped it off. He's a spinal surgeon, Ben. He has extensive experience in tumor removal.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hmm. How about that?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He can help you. I thought you'd be more excited. What's wrong?
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I need you to come with me.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet gets up.]
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[With green-shrouded mountains in the background, Ben hikes to a local summit with Juliet.]
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	After our last raid on the tail-section survivors, they ran off, left the beach. I sent Pickett and Tom to track their location, and they came across this. I'm sorry, Juliet.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He turns his head to look at something off-camera.]
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Sorry about what?
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet turns her head toward where Ben is looking. She begins running down the hill.]
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh my god, oh my god!
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She sees Goodwin's white-colored corpse, a stake through its middle, on the ground. She gasps and runs to Goodwin, brushing her hands over his face. Flies buzz around the corpse.]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh my god. Oh my god. [Sniffles, whispers] Goodwin. [Crying] What happened?
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We don't know; there weren't any witnesses. I can only assume they found out he wasn't one of them. Guess I should've listened to you.
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why are you showing me this? Why did you bring me out here?
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What, you mean instead of his wife?
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He turns to leave.]
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You knew this would happen. You sent him out here because you knew this would happen. (Cries) You wanted this! You wanted him to die! Why?
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	"Why"? You're asking me "why"? After everything I did to get you here, after everything I've done to keep you here, how can you possibly not understand... that you're mine!
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben looks down, surprised at himself.]
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Take as much time as you need.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He storms off.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Juliet and Charlotte exit the Tempest. The building is still humming with the sound of electricity. Kate approaches and draws her gun on them.]
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Whoa, Kate, it's all right. They're on our side.
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Our side, Juliet? She just knocked me unconscious.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Yeah. I'm very sorry about that, but I had no choice. Look, Daniel's inside securing the facility. If you come with me, I will be more than happy to explain exactly how we just saved your life.
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	All right. Let's go.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll take their word for it.
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte takes Kate inside, leaving Jack and Juliet alone.]
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You okay?
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	He wanted me to kill them. Ben. He told me to kill both of them.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack turns away, then comes back.]
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How can he tell you anything?
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I don't know, but he knew how to get to me, and he knew where they were going and what they were doing. Don't you understand? These people came here to wage war against Ben, and Ben's going to win, Jack. And when he does, you don't want to be anywhere near me.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why not?
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Because he thinks that I'm his. [Crying] And he knows how I feel about you.
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack kisses Juliet.]
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He knows where to find me.
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet hugs Jack.]
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A horseshoe clanks against a stake. Sawyer and Hurley are pitching horseshoes at the Barracks.]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh! Beat that. [Laughs]
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another horseshoe clanks as Hurley scores a perfect shot. He laughs.]
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son of a bitch! How'd you get so damn good at horseshoes?
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know. Guess I'm just [he sees something]... lucky.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley sees Ben walking outside carrying a stack of clean, folded linens. Sawyer stares, his mouth gaping.]
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell are you doing out?
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[cheerfully] See you guys at dinner.
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben marches into a house and shuts the door behind him, leaving Sawyer and Hurley dumbfounded.]
