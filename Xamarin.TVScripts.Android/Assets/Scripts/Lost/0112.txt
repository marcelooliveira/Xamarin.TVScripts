Whatever the Case May Be

4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate picking fruit on a tree, then climbing down. She hears a noise and stops. She continues walking, hears the sound again and picks up rock and throws it.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[off camera in the jungle, then stumbling into the clearing] Ow. Son of a bitch. What the hell are you doing?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What the hell are you doing?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's my knee. You practically busted my damn knee.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You stalking me, now?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Stalking you? I was protecting you.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	From what? Southern perverts?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, whatever. I can't believe you.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's not that bad.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's my knee. I'll tell you how bad it is. What the hell you doing out here anyway?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Everyone's been eating a lot. This is the only place the trees aren't picked clean.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well, you shouldn't be out here alone. Not after what happened...
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, of course. [Mocking Kate] I don't need protection. I can take care of myself. Me Kate. Me throw rock.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[hearing something] Shhhh.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What? You smell blood on the wind?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You don't hear that?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They move toward the sound. The sound of water gets louder as Kate and Sawyer emerge from some bushes to reveal a large spring with a waterfall. Sawyer starts running toward it taking off his shirt.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you doing?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I need to soak my sore knee. Come on, Freckles, after all we've been through on this damn Island, don't we deserve something good? What? You going to say no? You some sort of navel-gazing, no-fun, mopey type?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer climbs in. Kate takes off her pants and gets in.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, [happy she's taking her pants off]... it's chilly. Come on, girl, woohoo. It's nice, huh? C'mon, what you got? C'mon, let's go up the rocks. C'mon.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer and Kate frolicking in the spring. They climb up some rocks and dive in. More frolicking until they see two dead bodies from the plane under the water still strapped in their seats.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They surface from the spring, sputtering.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, are you okay?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. Yeah, you?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I'm going to go check them out.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Check them out for what?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	See what they got on them.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer!
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They dive down and Sawyer gets a wallet off the dead guy. Kate sees a silver case. They surface.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, I got myself a wallet.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're disgusting.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He ain't gonna miss it.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Help me get that case.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, I'm disgusting, but you're not?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's mine.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They dive under and struggle a bit to get the case which Sawyer pulls free.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[handing Kate the case] Wouldn't happen to have your key on you, would you? [Kate looks the case over] That case ain't yours, is it?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, you wouldn't mind if I just -- take it.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't care.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Not what it looks like. [Sawyer watches as Kate puts her pants back on.] Something you want to tell me about this little suitcase, Freckles?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Take it.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks away.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Then we see a shot of the ocean. Big waves are pounding. People are trying to rescue luggage that's being washed off the beach.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Everything is getting washed out to sea. This can't be normal. The tide shifting so suddenly, rising in so short a time.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	There's a lot not normal around here. At the rate this beach is eroding this fuselage is going to be underwater in a matter of days. We need to get all this stuff off the beach before nightfall.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I just hope that moving up the coast will make a difference.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It would make a difference if everyone moved inland.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I think you'll find people slightly wary of entering the jungle after what happened to the pregnant girl. Not to mention whatever that thing is.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sayid, I need you to take me back to the French woman, Rousseau. Claire's still out there. Now, Rousseau mentioned that there are others on this Island.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Her mind is gone.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You heard them yourself.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know what I heard.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You said that when you...
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The wind, Jack. It was the wind playing tricks.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, then, what about the papers that you took from her -- the documents, the maps. I mean, isn't there anything here that. . .
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm skilled at mathematics and decryption, but these equations are beyond anything I've ever seen. There are these notes in French accompanying some of the maps and diagrams. If I could translate them I might be able to make sense of it, but. . .
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Perhaps some things are best left untranslated.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah? [pointing at Charlie] Maybe you should tell him that.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie sitting on the beach, looking sad. Shot of people still getting luggage out of the surf. Shot of Shannon reading a magazine. Boone approaches.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Glad to see you're doing something productive with your time.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Where have you been?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What do you mean where have I been?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You and Locke have been leaving before sunrise and coming back after dark for the last 4 days. What are you doing out there? Is he your new boyfriend?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We're looking for Claire.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I thought there was no trail anymore -- that no one even knew where to look.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah, well, at least I'm doing something. Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just -- you're useless.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Reaction shot of Shannon looking chagrined. Shot of ocean sunset. Shot of Kate sitting by a fire. She sees Sawyer with her case.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Kate at a bank.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Mark Hutton	Okay, Ms. Ryan, if you'll just give me some ID, we'll get started on your loan app.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[handing her ID to Hutton] Okay, here you go.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	So what brings you to New Mexico?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	My work.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	And what line of work is that?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm a photographer.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	What do you photograph?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I've been commissioned for a coffee-table book. Uh, pictures of old theaters in small towns.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	Oh, there's a fantastic one down in Ruidoso. You can't miss it. It's right off the main road.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, if I end up using it, I'll have to make sure I give you acknowledgment, Mr. -- Hutton.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	Mark.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear the sound of a door slamming.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBERS	Everyone down on the ground. Down on the ground, now.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of masked men shooting out the security cameras. Hutton reaches for the alarm button.]
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBERS	Don't. Don't even think about it. Let's go. Shut up and move over there. Let's go. Move. Who's back there, I see you. All right, big boy, get your ass down there! Get out. [to Kate] Alright, girlie, get up and get over there! Let's go, move. Stay there, right there! Get down on the floor, bitch! [to Hutton] Are you the manager?! I said, are you the manager?!
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	Yes.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Good. Then let's open the money cage now, before people start getting killed.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBER #2	Don't look at me, look at the floor.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate on the floor.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back to the beach. Shot of Kate going into Sawyer's tent. She sees him sleeping with the case between his knees. She sneaks up and tries to take it, but he grabs her and traps her with his legs around her waist.]
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Gotcha.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Get off of me.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Golly, I hate to bicker about positions, sweetheart. But I think you're the one on top. Maybe you're not here for the case at all.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate head-butts him and tries to grab the case, but Sawyer is stronger.]
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ow, woman. If you wanted to play rough, all you had to do was say so. You want to try for it again?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Give it to me.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks away.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon sunning herself. Sayid limps up.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're quite close to the equator. The sun might be stronger than what you're used to.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I have a pretty good base.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	There was a matter I was going to ask you about.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon sits up with no top on, covering her front with a pink shawl.]
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I need a favor. I need your help translating some papers I took from Rousseau.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Who's Rousseau?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The French woman -- the distress call we intercepted.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Did my brother put you up to this?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Your brother? No. The papers contain equations accompanied by notations in French. If I could understand the notations, then-
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Sorry, can't do it.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're the only person on this Island who speaks French.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I barely speak French.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Please, Shannon, can you at least try?
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Reaction shot of Shannon. Shot of Sawyer trying to pick the lock on the case.]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[frustrated that he can't open the case] Son of a bitch!
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Michael	[passing by] You're wasting your time, man. If you pick the lock on a Halliburton, I'll put you on my back and fly us to LA.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You better find yourself a runway, daddy, cuz there ain't a lock I can't pick.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[coming up along-side Michael] What's he trying to do?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Pick the lock on a Halliburton.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[laughing, walking away] Good luck.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	The only way you're going to open that case is with pure force, man. Impact velocity.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You've got to hit it with something hard, like a sledgehammer. Or the axe.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Boone making his way through dense jungle with the axe. He comes upon Locke sitting.]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You got it?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[giving/throwing the axe to Locke] Yeah. Right there. Isn't there any easier way to get there?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The easiest way isn't always the best. Did anybody see you take it?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No, I don't think so.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, which is it?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Sorry?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No? Or, I don't think so?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Good. Let's get to work.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Rose dragging a piece of wreckage across the beach. She passes by Charlie.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Hello, Charlie. [He doesn't respond.] Oh, that's right, you're not talking much these days. It doesn't mean you get to be rude.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Excuse me?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Everybody else is helping us move the camp up the beach except for you.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are you serious?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Do you think you're the only one on this Island that's got something to be sad about? Baby, I've got sob stories for you, so why don't you grab the other end of this thing and help me. Well?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie reluctantly gets up to help.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer trying to open the case by smashing it on a rock, which doesn't open the case.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on. Come on, god.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer, now at the top of the cliff above.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Impact velocity -- physics my ass. Alright. [He drops the case but it doesn't open.] Son of a... Unbelievable. [Kate runs up and grabs the case.] Hey, hey, don't even think about it! Hey! Damn it.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer chasing Kate through the jungle. He catches her.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it. I just didn't know how bad. [Kate tries to head-butt him again.] Whoa-hoa, you're going to have to come up with a new move. [She head-butts him again.] Ow, god, okay, okay. [Sawyer grabs the case.] Okay, this is just silly. Hold on. I've got a proposition for you. You tell me what's inside and I'll give it to you.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you serious?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hell, no way to open the damn thing. At this point all I care about is satisfying my own curiosity. [Kate lunges for the case.] Whoa, easy, sweetheart, I don't really care what it is. What's burning me up is why it means so much to you. -- Last chance. Alright.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer walks away with the case.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We are back at the bank robbery.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	[off-camera at first] Give me the key, now. I'm tired of asking nice. Give me the money cage key, now.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	You're just going to kill me, anyway, why would I give you-
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	[hitting Hutton so he falls] You think we're in a conversation, here, huh?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBER #2	Everybody be cool! You want to go home?! Don't look at me, look at the floor! Be calm, stay down!
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	[to Hutton] Listen to me, I am not going to ask you again. I want that key!
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BASEBALL HAT	I can take him.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BASEBALL HAT	The tall guy, he's not watching us... It's now or never. Keep your head down.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Baseball Hat grabs Six Foot Five (one of the robbers) and the gun falls and slides toward Kate.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BASEBALL HAT	Pick it up, pick it up! Shoot him! Shoot him! What's wrong with you, shoot the gun! Turn off the safety!
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate picks up the gun and stands up. Points the gun. Tries firing. Jason comes over.]
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Give me that gun.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BASEBALL HAT	Other side, turn it off!
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't know how to use a gun!
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Baseball Hat gets knocked out by the other robbers. Jason grabs the gun from Kate.]
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBER #2	You want to get shot, fat boy, huh?
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	[grabbing Kate by the neck] Okay, little hero...
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, please don't.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Shut up. Let's you and me go talk, huh?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He drags her into a room. Hutton looks on, worried. Jason slams the door, rips off his mask.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	I don't know how to use a gun? That's classic.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[laughs] Yeah.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Jason kiss.]
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Sayid and Shannon at a make-shift table with maps and papers laid out.]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You never said anything about math.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You worry about the French, I'll take care of the math.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I can't do this.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If you really put your mind to it, I know you can, Shannon. Where did you learn to speak French?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I knew this guy.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This guy?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	In France, in Saint Tropez. I kind of lived there for a while.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Well, they say that is the best way to learn a foreign language.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[going back to working on the papers] Alright. Let me see.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sun with some plants in the caves. Jack approaches.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[pointing to one of her plants] So, what is this? What is this for?
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«â€˜ÂÃ­â€ ÂµÃ¬â€”Â Ã¬â€œÂ°Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å â€ Ã¬â€¢Â½Ã¬Â´Ë†Ã¬ÂÂ¸Ã«ÂÂ°, ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å¸Â¬Ã«â€¹Ë†ÃªÂ¹Å’...
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun puts her hands to her temples and makes like she's in pain.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	A headache? [Sun nods.] Oh, cool, alright.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[entering] Jack? We got a problem.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We have a problem? Or, you have a problem?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[looking toward Sun like she doesn't want Sun to hear] Jack, you're the only one who knows about me. [They move off a little ways.] Before I left the city, the Marshal who was escorting me, he had this silver case. The airline wouldn't let him bring the case on the plane. It was hard enough trying to convince them to let him wear a gun on his ankle. But the case, they made him check it.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What was in the case?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Some traveling money, some of his personal stuff. And 4 nine millimeters with a few boxes of ammo.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Guns?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Guns.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sun overhearing.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So, where is the case now?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer has it.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Aha.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He hasn't been able to open it.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Lucky for us.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He will. Sooner or later.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So, what do you need me to do?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I know where the key is. The Marshal, he kept it in his wallet. In his back pocket.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I buried him, Kate.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I know. Where?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So, what else is in the case?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What else is in the case, Kate?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Nothing.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's the truth?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Just the guns.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If you want my help, we're going to open the case together.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie and Rose moving stuff on the beach.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why are you smiling?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Am I?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You look -- happy.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, I guess I must be then.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	There's no reason to be happy, things are awful.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	They're not that awful.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're stranded on an Island. No one's coming for us.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You don't know that.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, what I do know, is there's something in that jungle that eats people. Just because we haven't heard from it in a couple of weeks doesn't mean it won't get hungry again. And I know there's a person, or people, that are trying to hurt us...
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Charlie. Nobody blames you.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	For what happened to Claire. It's not your fault. You did everything that you could do. And you came very close to dying yourself.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Maybe I should have died.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You know what I think, Charlie? You need to ask for help.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Who's going to help me?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of the jungle floor.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[off camera, at first] So, why didn't you put him with the others, when you burned the fuselage?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I needed to bury him.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Kate grab some make-shift shovels.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So you ready to do this?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We are back at the bank.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Hell, yeah, by now their imaginations are running wild.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't hold back. He won't talk if the details are off.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	You and your details, Maggie. [He hits her.]
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jason brings Kate out from the back room with red marks on her face.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Okay, hero.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, please don't. I've got...
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	[pushing Kate to the floor] Shut up.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBER #3	Everybody just relax. I said quiet.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Okay, Mr. Manager, you want to be a hard-ass? Protect a vault that doesn't even belong to you? [Kate is shaking her head no at the manager.] Okay? There's going to be consequences.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's going to kill me anyway.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	I said... if you don't shut up! You've got 3 seconds to give me that damn key. 1, 2, [cocks his gun], 3.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	Alright, I'll give it to you.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Good. Let's go, right around here. Let's go.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Kate and Jack digging up the grave of the Marshal. Coughing and gagging.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, alright?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Compared to what?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You want me to...
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, I'll do it.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gets the wallet from the Marshal's back pocket, much gagging going on. Kate gets it and jumps out of the grave.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you get it?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate opens the wallet which has maggots in it and throws it on the ground. Jack picks it up and looks through it.]
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Key isn't in here.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It isn't?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, but that was real good sleight-of-hand distracting me with the wallet. [Jack grabs Kate's closed hand.] Open it. [Kate opens her hand to reveal the key which Jack takes.]
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack, I...
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't. Don't. [Jack walks away.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Shannon and Sayid working on the translation.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	A des reflets d'argent. La mer des reflets changeants -- the sea of sparkles? No, wait, um, the sea of silver sparkles that change. [Sort of laughing] It's the same as the last one.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you sure? [Slightly annoyed.] But the equation is completely different. It doesn't relate. What you're saying doesn't make any sense.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Okay?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What about this one? It should say something about latitude or longitude, something about the stars...
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Okay, just give me some room, okay? Um, next to the pond, blue, um, blue eternity, blue eternity? No, wait, no, blue infinity.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Blue infinity?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Blue infinity. There's something about this that is so familiar.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You've been telling me what sounds very much like nonsense for the past hour and now it seems to me...
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Okay, a) I told you that my French sucks, and b) this isn't my nonsense, okay? Did you ever think that after 16 years on Mystery Frickin' Island your friend might not be quite adjusted?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[picking up the papers] This was a mistake.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah, haven't you heard? I'm completely useless.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon walks off, upset. Shot of Sawyer at his tent, Jack approaches.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Doctor? What can I do you for? [Jack points to the case.] Figured she'd get you to do her dirty work for her. So what? Are we going to wrestle for it?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, you're going to give it to me.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Am I?
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm just going to give it to you?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why would I want to do that?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Cephalexin.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, go on?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's the antibiotic I've been giving you for the knife wound in your arm. You're right in the middle of the treatment cycle now, if I keep giving you the pills you're going to be as right as rain. But I'm going to stop giving you the pills. And for 2 days you're going to think you're all good, then it's going to start to itch. The day after that the fever's going to come and you're going to start seeing red lines running up and down your arm. A day or two after that you'll beg me to take the case, just to cut off your arm.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's a nice story, Jack. And, even if it were true, I don't think you could do it.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're wrong.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Did she tell you what's inside? [Jack shakes his head.] Yeah, me neither. [He gives the case to Jack.] Hope you got yourself some jaws-of-life back in cave-town, that's what it's going to take to pop this bitch.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll figure something out.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I know you think you're doing her a favor. But however she talked you into doing this, she lied, brother.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate sitting on the beach with her far-away look, Jack walks up with the case.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're going to do this together.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because that's what I said we'd do.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks off and Kate follows.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Back to the robbery.]
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	What the hell you waiting for? Open the damn thing. [Hutton opens the door.] Well, now we're talking. Don't move.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Please, don't. I can't...
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Shut up.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	I let you in, now please, let the girl go.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	Let the girl go? Man, you have no idea, do you? The girl is the one who set you up. The girl picked this bank, picked this vault. This whole thing is the girl's idea. [He takes his mask off.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you doing?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	[pointing gun at Hutton] Easy, Maggie -- just cleaning up after myself.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate grabs a gun from Robber #2 and points it at Jason.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You shoot, I shoot.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	Please, what's...
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I said, no one gets hurt.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	I know you're cold, baby. But you're not that cold.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He cocks his gun. Kate shoots him in the leg. Then she shoots Robber #2 & #3.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	You shot me, stupid bit...
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Shut up, Jason.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBBER #2	I told you not to trust her.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Hutton] I need the key to safety deposit box 815, now.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	Who are you?
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The key to the box, now.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HUTTON	You need 2 keys. The bank's, and... [Kate holds up a key.] If you had the customer key, why would you need...
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm not on the signatory card.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JASON	You put me up to this to get into a safe deposit box? I swear to god, you better kill me, Maggie. Because if you don't...
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	My name's not Maggie. [to Hutton] Now, go.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate opens the box which reveals an envelope inside.]
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Jack with the case.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Anything you want to tell me? [Kate doesn't respond.] Alright then. [Jack opens the box and pulls out money, guns, ammo, and finally an envelope marked Personal Effects. Jack opens it and hands Kate a smaller envelope.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is this it? Is this what you wanted?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate opens the envelope and pulls out a small "toy" airplane.]
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is it?
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's nothing.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is it, Kate?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You wouldn't understand.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I want the truth, just this once. What is it?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It belonged to the man I loved.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The truth.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It belonged to the man I loved.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Stop lying and tell me the truth!
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm not! It belonged to the man I killed!
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sits down and starts crying. Jack looks nonplussed, he closes up the case and walks away.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of everyone moving up the beach. Walt with his dog. Rose sitting by a tree, Charlie approaches.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Your husband was in the tail section of the plane.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Yes, he was. But he'll be back.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You think he's still alive?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I know he is.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	How?
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I just do. It's a fine line between denial and faith. It's much better on my side.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie starts crying.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Help me.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Baby, I'm not the one that can help you... Heavenly Father, we thank you. We thank you for bringing us together tonight, and we ask that you show Charlie the path...
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon walking up to Sayid on the beach.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	The guy from Saint Tropez, he had this kid, a real snot, who hated me. His name was Laurent. He watched this movie over and over and over again, everyday, all day, the way kids do, 900 times. It was the cartoon about fish, you know, one of the computer ones?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why are you telling me this?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Because the movie was dubbed in French. And at the end there was this song. Those notations, they're song lyrics. And your French woman, she's just like Laurent, because she wrote them over and over and over again.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's the song?
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[singing] La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs. A des reflets d'argent. La mer. Des reflets changeants. Sous la pluie. La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs...
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone stares at Sayid and Shannon from behind a tree with a weird look on his face. Jack walks by Kate and looks at her. Kate just stares at her toy airplane.]
