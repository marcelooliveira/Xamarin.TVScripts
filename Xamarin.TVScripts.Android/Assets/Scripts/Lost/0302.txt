6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a close up of a glass ballerina figurine tumbling through air in slow motion in front of a fire before it crashes to the ground, shattering. A little girl looks guilty and runs out of the room. She goes to another room and starts to practice piano with a metronome. Mr. Paik enters with a bag filled with the broken remains of the ballerina and drops it at the little girl's feet.]

18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Sun splashing water on her face in the bathroom on the sailboat -- looking like she doesn't feel well. Jin knocks on the door.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Off camera] Ã«Â¬Â¸ Ã¬â€”Â´Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«Â´Â. [Subtitle: Sun -- open the door. ]

26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â§â€žÃ¬Ë†ËœÃ¬â€Â¨! [Subtitle: Jin -- wait.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the sailboat offshore, nearby the column of black smoke coming from the signal fire they lit in Live Together, Die Alone. Sayid is adding a notation to one of Danielle's maps.]

36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	He doesn't think Jack and the others are coming. It's been over a day since we lit the fire. They should be here by now.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack knows we're out here. He's counting on our signal. Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke. If he's North of us, the mountains would block his view.

42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We need to sail forward along the coast, clear the mountains, and start another signal fire.

48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I told Jack I would light a fire. I'm not abandoning him.

54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	My husband thinks we have to do as he says because he's the only one who knows how to sail. But he's wrong. I can help you sail the boat.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack sitting in the corner of his cell. Someone opens the door for her and Juliet enters carrying a tray of food.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Are you feeling any better? I made the soup myself, but I won't take it the wrong way if you don't like it.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet exits, goes to another door and knocks. Ben opens the door and we can see a bank of screens used to monitor what's happening in various locations, like Jack's cell.]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You never made soup for me.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A woman, Colleen, climbs down a ladder and enters the room where Juliet and Ben are.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	Am I interrupting something?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Would it really matter if you were?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	We have a situation -- Ryan radioed in -- the Iraqi found the decoy village.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Good, it's what we wanted.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	Ryan followed him back to the shore and they have a sailboat.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	How?!
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	I have no idea.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	So they have a boat -- sailing in circles will keep them busy.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	They could find us. [long pause] Ben?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm thinking. How quickly can you put together a team?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	Within the hour.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Then don't waste time talking to us. [Colleen starts to exit] Hey Colleen, I want that boat.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer work the levers to release a fish biscuit and food. The music starts and Kate awakens.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Nice alarm clock.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I've woken up to worse. [We see Pickett and some Others entering] Want half a fish biscuit?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett and the guards open the cage doors and Pickett hands Sawyer a lunch box.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's this?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Lunch -- we're going to need you to keep up your strength.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Is that right?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Sawyer being led along a path. Colleen approaches with a small group of Others.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	Danny, wait!
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Hold up.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COLLEEN	[whispering] They have a boat. (There's more whispering that's inaudible.)
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Okay, be careful out there.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett gives Colleen a kiss on the cheek, as Sawyer looks on.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	What are you looking at?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid loading a gun on the boat while Jin looks toward shore with binoculars. Sun approaches.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Getting ready to leave] Ã«Ââ€ºÃ¬â€”ÂÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã¬â€žÅ“ Ã¬â€ Â Ã¬Â¢â‚¬ Ã«Â³Â´ÃªÂ³ Ã¬ËœÂ¬ÃªÂ²Å’. [Subtitle: I have to adjust the sails.]

128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sun in bed looking sad. Someone next to her sits up, and it's revealed that it's Jae Lee.]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JAE	What's wrong?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What's wrong is I'm married.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JAE	Right. That.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss.]

144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JAE	[in English] I don't want to share you anymore. Your English is excellent now. You can go to America.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A knock on the door surprises them.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JAE	Does anyone know you're...
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	No!
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jae answers the door and sees a hotel employee.]

162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PAIK	Ã¬ËœÂ· Ã¬Å¾â€¦Ã¬â€“Â´. [Subtitle: Get dressed.]
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see several people working to clear an area, tamping down the ground, hoeing, etc. We see Kate and Sawyer being led into the area.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Alright, here's the jig -- see these rocks, here? That's where you two come in. [pointing to Kate] You're going to chop them loose. [pointing to Sawyer] And you're going to haul them out of here.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You expect me to work in this dress?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Well, it's up to you? You can take it off if you want.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks at her and smiles salaciously. Kate gives him a dirty look.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Pickett] How dare you?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Now, if you need anything -- you raise your hand. You get 10 minutes for lunch.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[raising his hand] I got a question, boss.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	No questions.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She got to ask a question.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	If you try to run off, you will be shocked.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Shot?! We don't even get a warning?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Shocked. I said, shocked. If you talk to each other you're going to be shocked. If you touch each other, you're going to be shocked. If you're slacking, you're going to get shocked. Matter of fact, if you do anything at all that pisses me off, you're going to get shocked. Okay? Let's get to work.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett walks toward her, then shocks Sawyer with a taser-like device. Sawyer drops to the ground.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Now, that was a quarter charge. You got anymore questions?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett walks over to Sawyer and yanks his head back by the hair.]
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	As soon as you're able to walk -- the wheelbarrow's right over there.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Jin in Mr. Paik's office.]

390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin expertly handles the gun, checking the ammo and loading it.]

394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to Sun] I think you'd be safer on the boat. [Sun starts to leave.] Sun, if by chance they get past us -- there's another gun. It's inside the blue tarp beneath the galley counter.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	If they get past you, that means my husband is dead. And I won't care anymore.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	As I said, the gun is inside the tarp.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Juliet drinking from a canteen and chatting with another guy. Sawyer is unloading a barrow full of rocks nearby, and watches them. Juliet notices him staring and throws him the water canteen. He catches it and then empties it on the ground. He watches Kate hacking away at the rocks. He thinks a second, then marches up to Kate and kisses her. Pickett and another guy run over, shouting. Pickett smashes Sawyer in the head with the butt of his rifle. A fight ensues with Sawyer fighting 3 of the Others. He gets a Taser away from one guy, but it doesn't work when he tries it. He gets a gun that's fallen on the ground.]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[pointing the gun] Back off!
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	James!
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks around and sees Juliet pointing a gun at Kate.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Put the gun down. Right now. [very calmly] Put the gun down.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer drops the gun, and Pickett walks up and Tasers him.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nighttime. We see Sayid and Jin hiding on the beach waiting to ambush the Others. We see Sun in the galley of the boat making tea. Suddenly Others are sneaking onto the boat. Sun hears them and grabs the gun.]
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Jin sitting in his car, a gun and a picture of Jae on the dash. He finally sees Jae and follows him in the hotel. He approaches Jae menacingly just as Jae's about to go into a room.]

436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sayid and Jin are still waiting in the bushes.]

440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the boat we see the Others stealthily climbing onto the boat. Colleen enters the galley, and Sun comes out from hiding, pointing her gun.]

458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Stop! I will -- I'll shoot you.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The boat engine starts up; and Sun fires hitting Colleen in the gut. Colleen falls. Sun runs and closes a door as an Other fires at her. Sayid and Jin hear the gunfire and start running for the boat. As they get to the dock the Others fire at them. We see Sun trying to open a hatch overhead. The boat starts pulling away and Jin jumps in the water after it. Sun gets the hatch open, Tom takes a shot at her and she rolls off the boat and falls in the water. The boat continues to move on. Jin yells for Sun and finally hears her call back to him. He reaches her, speaks in Korean and they hug.]

486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Never better.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What the hell were you thinking?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I couldn't help myself -- you just looked so damn cute swinging that pickaxe. Chain gang looks good on you, Freckles.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[calling his bluff] Sawyer.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Two of those guards got some real fight in them. The rest of them, I'm not so much worried about. That heavy-set guy -- he packs a hell of a punch. The shaggy-haired kid's got some kind of martial arts training, but I think I could take him if I had to. Oh, FYI -- those zapper things got a safety on them.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[smiling] Did you see the look on their faces when you got a hold of that rifle?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm guessing most of these boys have never seen any real action. But that blond who had a gun pointed at you? She would have shot you -- no problem.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why'd she call you James?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because that's my name. I noticed something else, too. You taste like strawberries.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You taste like fish biscuits. So what do we do now?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, Shortcake, now we wait for these bastards to make a mistake.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We suddenly see this conversation between Kate and Sawyer is being watched by Ben on one of the screens in the room he was in earlier.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sooner or later, they're going to let their guard down. And when they do, we're going to be there to put them in their place.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack in his cell, on the floor with his back up against the wall. The camera pulls back and we can see Ben is in the cell.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Jack. [he sits on a small chair he brought in] You know what's crazy, Jack? A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation. I was the one locked up and you were the one coming in for visits. And I know that you were angry that I lied to you about who I was; but, hell, do you blame me? I mean, let's face it, if I had told you I was one of those people that you and your friends have been calling Others all this time it would have been right back to Sayid and his -- fists. Wouldn't it?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you want from me?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I want for you to change your at--perspective. And, the first step in doing that would be for me to be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so -- [he crouches down beside Jack and extends his hand to shake] Hi, my name is Benjamin Linus and I've lived on this island all my life. [pause] You're not going to shake?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben walks to the door and someone starts rolling a cart into the room.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Bring it in, please.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are Kate and Sawyer?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	They're fine; and they're close. That's all I'm able to tell you right now.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You can tell me anything you want.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Fair enough. It's all I want to tell you. I'm going to make this really simple, Jack. If you cooperate; we send you home.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Cooperate with what?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	When the time is right, I'll tell you...
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You tell me now.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Patience, Jack. Patience.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Home -- is that where you sent Walt and Michael?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] If you could leave this island why would you still be here?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes, Jack, why would we be here?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're lying. You're stuck here just like we are. You don't have any...
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Your flight crashed on September 22nd, 2004. Today is November 29th. That means you've been on our island for 69 days. Yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that during those 69 days your fellow Americans re-elected George W. Bush; Christopher Reeve has passed away; the Boston Red Sox won the World Series. [Jack starts laughing] What?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If you wanted me to believe this, you probably should have picked somebody else besides the Red Sox.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, they were down 3 games to none against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won 8 straight.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] Sure. Sure, of course they did.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben turns toward the cart that was rolled in the turns on a TV. It shows the Red Sox winning the World Series. Jack moves toward the TV in disbelief and watches the end of the game. Ben turns the TV off.]
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's home, Jack. Right there, on the other side of that glass. And if you listen to me -- if you trust me -- if you do what I tell you when the time comes -- I'll take you there. I will take you home.
