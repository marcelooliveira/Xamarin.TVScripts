6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Ana shooting at a firing range. Scene switches to Ana at the office of Matthew Reed, her therapist.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	So how're you doing?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Well, the family with the screaming baby moved.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	You must be thrilled.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Actually, it's too quiet now.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	So, how's Danny -- you two trying to work things out?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	There's nothing to work out. He left.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	You okay with that?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I guess you could say I'm one of those people that's just better off alone.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	So, how was the firing range?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Good.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	How did it feel to hold a gun again?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Very good.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	All these steps count, Ana. You've come a long way since we met 4 months ago.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Did she say -- you know, when I can come back to work?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	She left the final determination up to me.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Right.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	Do you think you're ready?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	What do you think?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He hands Ana her badge. Shot of her LAPD badge.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	[off camera] Welcome back to the force, Officer Cortez.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Scene switches to right after Ana shot Shannon. Sayid pulls out his gun and goes after Ana.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Sayid! Sayid, no!
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko tackles Sayid and they fight. Ana cold-cocks Sayid, and grabs the gun.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, hey!
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[pointing the gun at Michael] Don't move! Nobody move!
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Nobody move! Nobody! [to Eko] Does he have anything else on him?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	What?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	He just had a gun to your neck -- check to see if he had anything else on him?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, put it down.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[pointing the gun at Michael] Stop.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Are you crazy? Don't point that at me?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I said stop!
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What is your problem, huh?!
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana fires off a warning round.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Ana!
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢Â¼, Ã«â€žË† Ã«Â¯Â¸Ã¬Â³Â¤Ã¬â€“Â´?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Get back! Get back, both of you!
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Are you crazy?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Ana.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Now!
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Ana!
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[to Eko] We need to tie him up.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I'm not tying him up.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	He tried to kill you.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	No.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[pointing the gun at Libby] You, you do it. Tie him. Use the vines from the stretcher.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, if we take that thing apart we won't be able to...
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Shut up!
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor or he'll die.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I know what I'm doing.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Ana at the police station.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	I hope this is all of it.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	That's all we've got right now.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Okay.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	Thanks, Captain.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana knocks at the Captain's open door.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Come on in.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	Hey, look who's here. Good to see you Ana Lucia, welcome back.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Thanks, Raggs.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	I'll get you those IRs, Captain.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Today.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	You've got it.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	[to Ana] How are you?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Good. Fine.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Good. Your assignment.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Evidence? You're putting me behind a desk?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Is that a problem?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I want patrol.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	I don't care what you want.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Just put me in a car.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	You were in an officer involve shooting -- no.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[Speaking in Spanish] [Subtitle: You're doing this because you're my Captain? Or because you're my mother?]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Both.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I need to be back on the street. Please.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	I put you in a car -- everyone's going to know I pulled strings. You don't want me to treat you like my daughter? Don't ask for favors.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Then transfer me.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana's mother/Captain fills out a form.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	You don't get the transfer, but I'll give you the car. Happy?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	Sorry to bother you Captain -- Ana, there's a call for you in the bullpen, they say it's real important.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Thanks, Raggs, I'll be right there.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	They got you a cake, try and act surprised.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack filling a water bottle, Rose approaches.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Jack, nice to see you out of the Hatch. You could use more sunshine.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll take that under advisement.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	A little fruit might do you good, too. Good for the constitution -- at least that's what they say.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, if that's what they say. [Jack takes a piece of fruit from Rose.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Mmmm?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where'd you get these?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, now just because you're a little excited -- no reason to talk with your mouth full.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Something drops out of the sky into the water trough Jack was using to fill his bottle. Jack grabs it, and finds it's a golf ball.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Past the hanging tree, double or nothing.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You sure?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, double or nothing, there's no way you're hitting it that far.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Double's 10 thousand bucks.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, that's nothing to someone who's worth 150 million dollars. He'll build you your own course, if you'd like.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you talking about?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ignore him, he's an idiot.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate swings and wins the bet.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Crap!
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[entering] You hooked it. Try keeping your left arm straight.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You giving me tips?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, I'm -- I'm a doctor.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So, you think you could do better?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[chuckling] Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	And what's golf?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Golf is accuracy.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, why don't we play a few holes and see which one of us is more accurate.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oooh, fighting talk.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're kidding, right?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	3 holes, no handicap, we play for bragging rights. What are we waiting for?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko giving a very sick and shaking Sawyer some water.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Ana, let's just get to their camp. It was an accident; they'll understand.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	They'll understand? I killed one of them. [motioning to Jin and Michael] If those two move, shout.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Wait, what are you doing?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana walks over to Sayid.]
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Untie me.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I'm not-
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Untie me!!!
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Ana.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko lifts Sawyer onto his back.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	What are you doing?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I'm taking him back to his camp.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Don't leave, please. If that were you, he'd let you die.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Ana and her partner, Big Mike, on patrol.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	So'd the shrink give you any good drugs?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[laughing] Not that kind of shrink.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	Did you miss me?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Boy, did I.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	I heard about you and Danny. Want me to go kick his ass for you?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Nah. It's better this way. What are we doing in Westwood?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	I thought a change of scenery would be nice -- a nice safe neighborhood for your first day back.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	This was her idea, wasn't it?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	She is the Captain.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Yeah.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICE RADIO VOICE	809, please respond to a domestic disturbance call at 2210 South Veteran.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	This is 8 Adam-16.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	That's not our call.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICE RADIO VOICE	Go ahead Adam-16.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	We're just 3 blocks from away from that call on Veteran. We got it.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICE RADIO VOICE	Copy that, 8 Adam-16.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana and Big Mike put on their siren. Scene switches to the domestic disturbance. A woman with a baby is fighting with a guy moving stuff.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHAWNA	Where are you going? What are you doing?! Drop the TV, Travis. The TV's mine.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana and Big Mike pull up.]
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRAVIS	I bought it with my money.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHAWNA	Liar!
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRAVIS	Did you call the cops?!!
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHAWNA	What?!
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRAVIS	Do something useful, Shawna, shut your trap!
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHAWNA	Arrest him; he is stealing my TV! He cannot get away with this!
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRAVIS	She hit me! She hit me!
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	Hey, enough, all of you! Both of you!
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[pulling her gun] Put your hands where I can see them! Get down on the ground!
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	Officer Cortez!
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Ma'am, get your baby upstairs.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	Ana Lucia!
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Hands on the ground!
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	Ana Lucia! He is down. Holster your weapon. Now.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Ana with Sayid and the rest of the group.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hey, I think you should let him go.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	No. He's going to come after me.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	You don't know that.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I killed someone he loves.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael gets up to give Sayid water.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Sit down. Now.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm bringing him water. You going to shoot me? Shoot me.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Don't even think of untying him.

346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who is that woman?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Her name is Ana Lucia. She was on the plane -- tail section -- they all were. We were bringing them back.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Where is Walt?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They took him -- the Others.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you mean they took him?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	From the raft -- the night we left.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid grunts and struggles.]
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, man. Hey, we're going to get out of this, man.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack throws a golf tee to the ground.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Guess you're first.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Lucky me.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know the lady's tee at my golf club back home is about 10 feet closer so if you...
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Shut up, Jack.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate swings and gets the ball very close to the hole.]

380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Wow, you really put it in there.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack crossing over a little creek to get to his ball.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We have more balls; you could always just take a drop.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm good. [Jack finds his ball] Got it.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sees something behind Jack.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You may want to move. [He sees the worried look on her face] What?

394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Where is the doctor?

402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Bathroom. He's burning up. We've got to get him in the shower -- bring his fever down.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What can I do?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, go through the medical stash; there's a bottle of Ofloxacin...
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Ofloxacin.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ofloxacin -- little white pills. Bring the alcohol and some gauge patches, and strip that bed and make sure it has clean sheets on it. Kate?!
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh, yeah, yeah.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate exits and Jack tends to Sawyer's wound. Locke enters and we hear the blip sound of the timer.]

430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	How long have I kept you alive out here, Bernard? [Bernard bows his head] That's right. So cut me some slack.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Hey, we just want to know what you're doing. What's the plan?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	She has no plan. She only has her guilt and a gun.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	You want a plan? [to Michael] Do you have any ammo, back at your camp?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Ammo -- for the gun -- do you have any back at your camp?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, a couple boxes.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Alright, I want it -- at least half. And I'll need a pack -- a big one -- a blanket, some medicine, clothes -- jeans and socks -- you getting all this?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, I got it.

474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BIG MIKE	So does that mean every time we run into some yo-yo with a TV in his hands, you're going to draw down?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RAGGS	[entering] Hey, Ana Lucia -- you're guy -- we got him.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a suspect in an interrogation room from the other side of the mirrored glass.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	His name is Jason McCormick. We picked him up on an assault on an elderly woman in Echo Park. His fingerprints matched a partial from your crime scene. We questioned him and he confessed. The D.A. is ready to file charges -- all he needs is for you to I.D. him.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	It's not him.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	He confessed.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I don't know him.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	[to the lawyers in the room] Can you guys give us a minute? [to Ana] Why are you doing this?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Because it's not him.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	He put 4 bullets into you -- hollow points through your vest -- he tried to kill you. You want a list of his priors? You want to put this guy back out on the street?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	It's not him.

528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's septic. The infection's gotten into the blood stream. If the anti-biotics don't bring the fever down he'll go into shock. Hold him up.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay, I've got him.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack puts a pill in his mouth and pours some water in. Sawyer coughs it out.]

536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll do it.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, no, I've got it.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I can do it. [quietly to Sawyer] Sawyer? Hey, you have to listen to me, okay? The only way that you are going to get better is if you take this pill. So I want you to swallow it, okay? Okay, here we go. [She puts the pill in his mouth and holds up the glass for him to drink] Now swallow, swallow. Good, good.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nice job. I never learned the whole whisper-in-the-ear thing in med school.

552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I just don't think you're the best judge of character. I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit.

642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Almost 40 days ago on this very Island I tied a man to a tree and tortured him. I tortured him as I've tortured many men -- men whose voices I still hear in the night. Should you kill me? Maybe you should. Maybe you were meant to.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I'm a cop... I was a cop. One night my partner and I responded to a burglary call. We were the first ones there. I covered the front and he went around the back. I was there a minute and then this kid comes right through the front door -- I tell him to put his hands up -- and he's says I'm making a mistake -- that he's a student and he wants to show me his I.D. I believed him. I just -- I let him reach. All I remember was a pop. By the time I hit the ground I thought I was dead. I feel dead.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What happened to him -- the man who shot you?
