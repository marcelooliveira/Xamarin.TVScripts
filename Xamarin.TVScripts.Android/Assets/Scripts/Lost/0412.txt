There's No Place Like Home, Part 1
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Stephen Williams
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - An endless expanse of sky over sea, with a few wisps of white clouds here and there on the horizon. Pull back to reveal we have been looking out the front windows of an airplane cockpit in flight. Gauges point steadily in every which direction on the instrument panel. From one of the gauges hangs a lucky rabbit's foot keychain. The arm of the pilot clutches the throttle; the arm of the copilot clutches a cup of coffee. The pilot, wearing aviator sunglasses, flicks a switch above him.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	We got a little chop ahead.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The copilot picks up the rabbit's foot and fondles it between his fingers.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	Put that away, man. You're freaking me out.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COPILOT	We need this thing. With the cargo we got back there? Bad mojo.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The pilot turns around to address a women strapped into the jumpseat behind him. She wears an Oceanic Airlines identification badge.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	Ms. Decker?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Yes?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	Wanna head back there and let 'em know we're landing?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Sure. Of course.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She takes off her headphones and puts them away, then gets up and heads back.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The engines whirr loudly as Ms. Decker, in a smart dark gray pantsuit, smiles as she passes someone strapped in a jumpseat at the front of the cargo hold, and navigates her way further back.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	We're coming in for a landing.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack has been trying to get some shut-eye. Hurley stares alertly. Kate and Sun look on listlessly, as does Sayid. Kate holds Aaron in her lap.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	It's a military facility just west of Honolulu. It's completely private. Your--your families are already here. Now there's a lot of press that wanna speak to you, but as far as Oceanic is concerned, you don't have to speak to any reporters.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Nodding] We'll talk to 'em.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Is that all right with all of you?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The others do not respond.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's fine. We all agreed. We just--we just wanna get it over with.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Okay. Um, they're referring to you as the "Oceanic Six". That's not the best branding as far as we're concerned, but it's catchy. We'll see you on the ground.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ms. Decker gingerly tiptoes in her heels back to her seat in the cockpit.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Plane descending.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We all know the story. If we get any questions that we don't wanna answer, or that we can't answer, let's just keep our mouths shut. It's okay. They'll--they'll think that we're in shock.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	We are in shock, Jack.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well... then this should be easy.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane approaches the runway on a developed island. Its tires screech as it touches down. Aaron fusses in Kate's lap. The Coast Guard taxis on the runway. Sun and Sayid sit quietly. The plane rolls to a halt. Jack unbuckles himself. The others follow suit. The cargo bay door opens on the plane, revealing daylight, and a number of figures who step into view. Four Coast Guard men carry a ramp into place. Hurley gets up, and so do everyone else. Hurley steps out first, waving hello; his mother and father rush up to greet him, with Sun's parents standing just beside them. Emotional music swells as Hurley hugs his parents, Jack hugs his mother, and Oceanic employees applaud the reunion. Hurley introduces Sayid to his parents, and Hurley's mother kisses Sayid on the cheek. Jack's mother kisses him. Sun's mother looks her over. Kate has no one waiting for her. She looks to the baby in her arms.]
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Darkness. The beach on the island. Kate stares distantly.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	It was Sayid and--and Desmond in the helicopter, right? I mean, it had to be. Why else would they have dropped that thingamabob right over us?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Steady beeping.]
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Then why wouldn't they just land?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know, but this thing is trackin' the chopper. So if they were on it, they want us to know where they're going.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	It's a phone, right? Can't we just call?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well?
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks to Faraday. He nods. Jack hands the sat phone to Faraday.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't try anything stupid.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	Understood.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Beeping. Static hisses.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	[Over phone] Put it down over there.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Is that from the chopper?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	Sh shh.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	[Over phone] We're still 5 klicks from the site.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	[Over phone] I said put it down, Frank. Okay, gear up, boys. Soon as we hit the ground, we deploy to the Orchid. Heads down! Let's do this.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Static]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know what "the Orchid" is?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No. I didn't hear Desmond or Sayid either.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate. [Clears throat] Wanna take a walk?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Absolutely.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll get the guns. You get some water, okay?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You can't possibly be serious. You just had surgery, Jack.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm gonna be fine.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If your sutures rip, you're not gonna be fine.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I can't just sit around waiting.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Recovery is not "sitting around"!
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, I have to do this.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I promised those people that I would get 'em off this island. [Sighs]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Don't bleed to death, Jack.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll see ya in a couple hours.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daniel is franticly flicking through his journal.]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Daniel? What's wrong?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	[Lowers voice] Charlotte, did you hear what he said? They're going to the Orchid. They're using the secondary protocol.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	What are you talking about?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daniel comes to a page with a drawing on it. The words "The Orchid" can be seen.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	We have to get off this island. Right now.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Beeping.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're catchin' up. The chopper must've landed.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why don't you take a break?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Steady beeping continues. Kate unzips her backpack and takes out a bottle of water.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're bleeding.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I'm not bleeding. I'm... I'm suppurating. It's... discharge. My body's just fightin' the infection around the stitches.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You know when most people are lying and they can't look you in the eye? You do the exact opposite.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack chuckles. A branch snaps. Footsteps approaching. Jack and Kate draw their guns and spread out. Miles emerges from the forest.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Hey, long time no see.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron crying. Sawyer and Aaron emerge from the forest.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, who are you talkin' to up there, Genghis?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Claire?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We lost her.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You what??
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She just walked off in the middle of the night. We looked for her for a day, but she was just gone. I was hopin' maybe she went back to the beach.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She didn't.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron crying.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, what are y'all doin' out here? What's that phone for?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The chopper flew over the beach. Someone tossed this out. It must've been Sayid.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, you better hope it ain't Sayid, 'cause if he's with those animals that just blew up half of New Otherton, you do not wanna tussle with 'em.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What, they tried to kill you?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just like Locke said they would.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So... what? We're supposed to just... turn around and hide? 'Cause it seems like that didn't work so well for you.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm sorry, Doc, maybe this is dÃƒÂ©ja vu, but didn't you just do the whole "run through the jungle with a walkie" plan?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That helicopter is our only way off this island.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron crying.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's with you and "gettin' off the island"? You're like a damn broken record.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Stop it! Are you two fightin' each other now?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Continues crying.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look. I put Sayid and Desmond on that chopper. It was my call. It's my responsibility. I'm going after it whether they're on it or not. You can all head back to the beach.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack... no, no, no. You can't go by yourself.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Take care of the baby. Okay?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks away by himself.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That son of a bitch is stubborn.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gun cocks.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hold up! You don't get to die alone.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A press conference is being held for the Oceanic 6.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Based on the location of the wreckage, our best estimate of the crash site is... [click] here. From there, the survivors were carried by the ocean's current to... [click] here--an uninhabited island in the Lesser Sunda Islands known as Membata. As you've all read in your briefing books, on day 103... [click] a typhoon washed up the remnants of an Indonesian fishing boat, including basic supplies and a survival raft. On day 108, the remaining six survivors, including Ms. Austen's baby which she gave birth to on the island of Membata, used this raft to journey here-- [click] an island called Sumba. They then came ashore near a village called Manukangga. This photo was taken by the local fisherman who found them. Once it was discovered who they were, they were transported to Honolulu by the U.S. Coast Guard. As you can imagine, this has been an extraordinarily trying experience. They have, however, agreed to answer a few questions. So, ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of Oceanic 8-1-5.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[All shouting at once.]
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Yes.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #1	Dr. Shephard! Dr. Shephard! Can you tell us what it was like when the plane hit the ocean? Uh, how you survived.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Camera shutters snapping.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um...
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shutters continue snapping.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It--it all happened really fast. I remember the impact. I remember the--the plane filling up with water. A group of us got to the emergency door, and, um... got out before it went down.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #1	And those of you who survived--you swam to the island?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. We had, uh, cushions. We had some life jackets. We were in the water for over a day before the current took us in. By then, there was only eight of us left.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(The next segment only appeared in the enhanced broadcast and DVD cut)]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #1	What happened to the other three?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	One of them, his name is Boone Carlyle, suffered tremendous internal injuries and died a few days after the crash. A woman, Libby, she didn't make it through the first week. Charlie Pace, he drowned a few weeks before we were able to leave.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(End extended segment)]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(The next segment only appeared in the original broadcast)]
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE REPORTER #1	Over here! Over here, please! Considering the ordeal that you've all been through, you look pretty healthy having been on an island for more than a hundred days.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Was that directed at me, Dude?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Laughter]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(End original segment)]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE REPORTER #1	Well, actually, Mr. Reyes, you were worth more than $150 million at the time of your... death. How does it feel to know you're going to get all that money back?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't want it back, any of it. That money was bad luck.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE KOREAN REPORTER	ÃªÂ¶Å’Ã¬â€žÂ Ã­â„¢â€ Ã¬â€Â¨, Ã¬â€žÂ¬Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬â€žÅ“ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã«Â§ÂÃ­â€¢Å“ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã«Å¾Å’ Ã¬Â¤â€˜ Ã­â€¢Å“ Ã«Âªâ€¦Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã¬ÂËœ Ã«â€šÂ¨Ã­Å½Â¸Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã«Â§Å¾Ã¬Å ÂµÃ«â€¹Ë†ÃªÂ¹Å’?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE REPORTER #2	What did she say?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #3	Can somebody translate that?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	She asked if my husband was one of the people who died on the island.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Camera shutter snaps.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Airplane taking off in distance.]
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	The answer is no. He never made it off the plane.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(The next segment only appeared in the enhanced broadcast)]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARABIC REPORTER	Are you aware of the situation in Iraq, Mr. Jarrah? Do you have any plans to return?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	There is nothing for me in Iraq.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARABIC REPORTER	Mr Shephard, now that you are home, what are your plans?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I haven't really thought too much about it, uh -- my father died in Sydney, I was bringing him home for the funeral when the plane crashed. Even though the body is... -- I'd like to put him to rest.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[(End extended segment)]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #4	Ms. Austen...
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[All shouting at once.]
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #4	What was it like giving birth on the island?
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Scary.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #4	Your son--uh, Aaron? How old is he now?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's just a little over 5 weeks.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE REPORTER #4	So that would've made you about six months pregnant when the U.S. Marshal service apprehended you in Australia for an outstanding murder warrant. Is that correct?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Uh, I'm afraid Ms. Austen's legal issue is off the table. Next question.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE REPORTER #1	Mr. Jarrah, given the amazing circumstances surrounding the survival of you six, is it possible there are any other survivors from the crash yet to be discovered?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No. Absolutely not.

304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. DECKER	Mr. Jarrah? There's a woman outside. She says she knows you, but she wasn't on the list of family members. Her name is a Noor Abed Jaseem.

324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He's fine. He's on the freighter. Listen, I'm going to start taking people back--six at a time. We have to go right now before the helicopter gets back to the boat.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Why do we have to go to the boat before the chopper gets back?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Because the men on that helicopter have every intention of killing us all.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack and Kate just went running after it.

336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So when is someone gonna tell me where we're going?
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We're going to a place called the Orchid, Hugo.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And what's that?
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	It's a greenhouse.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And why are we going to a greenhouse exactly?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You heard John. We're going to move the island.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Right. And how are we gonna do that?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Very carefully.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, if you could move the island whenever you wanted, why didn't you just move it before the psychos with guns got here?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because doing it is both dangerous and unpredictable. It's a measure of last resort.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Awesome.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben pushes aside some rocks to reveal a wooden box. Before Ben can open the box, Locke steps on it.]

364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke opens the box and tosses a package to Hurley. Hurley opens it up and and proceeds to begin eating the saltine crackers inside.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	May I have that mirror, please?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke hands him the mirror.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[To Hurley] You know, those are 15 years old.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben begins flashing the mirror toward a distant mountain peak.]
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What are you doing, Dude?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Communicating.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Communicating with who?
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who do you think?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben receives a reply from the mountain top.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	All right. Now we can go.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Wait. What was that? What did you tell them?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	None of your business, John.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	Hey, Sayid, listen. If you wanna run off into the jungle after the chopper, you should do that. But in the meantime, we need to get these people off this island.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I won't be long. If I can catch up with Jack and Kate--
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	I can start ferrying people now. I can get them there safely. By the time you get back, I can have most of these people on our boat.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I trust you know the bearing. You'd better get going.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	Thank you. [To group] All right, first group in the raft. We can fit six.

404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid? What are you doing here? Jack thought that you--
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I know what he thought. That's why I'm going after him. How far ahead is he?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't know. He's--he's with Sawyer. I left them about an hour ago. Jack's got a sat phone, and they're headed for the helicopter. I can track them. Look, you are not gonna catch up to them unless I go with you.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Let's go.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay. Sun.

518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Hugo, what are you doing with that?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know. I thought there might be a prowler or something.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Jesus Christ is not a weapon. Okay. Enjoy your party.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cheers and applause.]
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Wwhoo! Happy birthday!
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hawaiian music playing. Women laugh.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No way.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron coos.]
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Happy birthday, Hurley.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, Kate.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, little buddy.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Say hi. Jack's running late. Sorry.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Happy birthday, Hugo.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wow, you guys are here.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Interesting choice of theme.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, my mom... really doesn't get it, Dude.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hey! How's everybody doing? [Laughs] What are you talking about? Building a fire or huntin' boars? [Laughs] I guess not. Uh, listen. Uh, do you mind, uh, excusing us for a little while? I-I wanna show you your birthday present. Hmm? Come on. Bye-bye now.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and his father stand in front of a garage.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I told you I don't want anything.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hugo, it's your birthday. You gotta get somethin'.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Not with the money. I don't want anything from the money.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Relax. I got this before you gave us the money. Ta-da! Check it out.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[David shows Hurley a new, red Camaro.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You fixed it.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Yeah. After the crash, I--I worked on it as a memorial to you. When I was fixing it up, it was almost like I was with ya. But now you're back, and it's all yours. Wanna take her for a little spin?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley inserts the key in the ignition. Hurley sees "the numbers" - 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 - in the car's odometer & trip counter.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Is somethin' wrong, son?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Is this some kind of joke?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	What are you talking about?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Did you do this?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Do what?
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Those are the numbers! Right there! The numbers I won the lottery with!
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Wow. What--what a coincidence.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No. No, not a coincidence. I don't want this. I don't want any of it!
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley gets out of the car.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hugo? Wait--wait a minute. Hugo, what are you... son! Hey!
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley runs off.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hugo! Hugo! Hugo, where you goin'? Come on! Hugo!
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Ben, Hurley and Locke are walking through a bamboo forest.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, let's say this greenhouse place does what you say, and, yeah, I get it. It's really dangerous and unpredictable. But suppose somehow it works, and we move the island. Doesn't that mean the dudes with guns move, too?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes, I suppose they would.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, isn't that, you know, a problem?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm working on it.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, what about me? I still wanna get off it!
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm afraid it's a little late for that, Hugo.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Birds chirping in distance. Ben stops and kneels on the ground.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	May I have the binoculars, please? You might wanna get down lower to the ground.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And why might we wanna do that?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because we're at the Orchid.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are we waitin' for?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	We're waiting, John, because Charles Widmore, the man who's trying to capture me and kill all the rest of you, knows about this place and knows that what we need is inside.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Sighs] I thought you said you had no idea why he was trying to find he island.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I wasn't being entirely truthful.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah. When are you ever entirely truthful?
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You need to see this.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke takes the binoculars and uses them.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What am I looking for?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Look over there on the left-hand side. Watch the plants at the back.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't see any--
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke then sees the mercenaries patrolling the Orchid.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	They're already here.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The Zodiac arrives at the freighter.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	Hey, hey! Hey, we're back!
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Raft motor idling.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Where's Sayid?
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	He had to go after Jack. You go. They're headed for the chopper.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gasps.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You okay?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FARADAY	I'm gonna head back for the next group.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Revs motor. Daniel heads back.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[to Desmond] Engine's fixed. Tell Hendricks to try it.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Jin notice Michael. They stare in shock.]
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Okay, engine should be working.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Engines starting up.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HENDRICKS	[Australian accent] Indeed they are.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Laughs]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	All right, well, take us to the island.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Revs engines.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	But make sure you--you stay on the bearing of 3-0-5. It's gotta be exactly 3-0-5. [Static crackling]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HENDRICKS	We've got some kind of RF interference with the the fathometer. I can't see the reef, mate.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	RF interference? How is that possible? The radio room's down.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HENDRICKS	I don't know, but something on this boat is broadcasting. If we don't turn it off, I'm not going any closer than 5 miles off the coast.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Then I'll find it.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond runs off. Engines power down.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Sawyer walk through the jungle following the phone. Steady beeping.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Cut yourself shavin'?
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet took out my appendix a couple of days ago.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You kiddin' me.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nope.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, what else did I miss?
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Steady beeping continues.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Loud banging.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're here.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rattling in helicopter. Rattling continues.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Grunting.]
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Ah!
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Lapidus!
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Yeah! [Grunts]
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You know this yahoo?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	"Yahoo"? This yahoo dropped that phone on you guys so you could find me--
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bench rattles.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	--and I could fly you outta here. So why don't you do me a favor and get that back compartment? There's a toolbox. See if you can find something to get me outta these things.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You heard the man.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, all right. Can I get you boys a nice, cold glass of lemonade while I'm back there?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are Desmond and Sayid?
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Your buddies were smart enough to keep their asses on the boat because right now that's the safest place to be. Because when the boys that I brought over here come stompin' out of this jungle, you're gonna wanna be long gone.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where'd they go?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	They're up by some greenhouse, perched up there, waitin' to snatch Linus.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Soon as we cut you free, you'll be able fly us out of here?
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Hell, yeah.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hang on, Shaggy. You said the hit squad's gonna grab Ben Linus?
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Well, I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What are they gonna do with the people that are with him?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Nothin' good.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Jack] Hugo's with Ben.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Sighs] Son of a bitch.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A photo of Christian is on display. Jack is speaking to a church of people.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	About ten months ago, I wrote what I wanted to say at my father's funeral on the back of a cocktail napkin at the Sydney airport. I don't remember what I wrote, but whatever it was... he would've hated it.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Chuckles. Laughter.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My father couldn't stand eulogies. "The only good thing about a wake is the free booze", he'd say.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Scattered laughter.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not much of a wake because I won't even be able to bury him. So... What I wanna say is not for my father. It's for me. Good-bye, dad. I loved you. I miss you.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[After the service, Jack thanks people as they leave.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks very much for coming.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Thank you.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thank you.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Thank you for coming.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	I'll see you back at the house?
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	I love you, sweetheart.
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I love you, Mom.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	[Whispers] I'm so glad you're home.
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Chuckles] I'll see you soon.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Okay.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Margo leaves.]
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You did that well.
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Had a lot of practice.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron cries. A woman approaches Jack.]
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAROLE	[clears throat] Excuse me. May I have a word with you? [Australian accent] Mr. Shephard... I'm very sorry for your loss.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thank you. How did you know my father?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAROLE	I believe I'm the reason he was in Australia when he died.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why would he have come to see you?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAROLE	Oh, he... he didn't come to see me. I was still in the hospital. I never saw him. He came to see his daughter. My daughter, Mr. Shephard.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My father didn't have a daughter--
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAROLE	Yes. He did. If you don't believe me, check his phone records. Would you like to know the--the strangest thing about all this, Mr. Shephard? My daughter was on your plane, too. She was on flight 8-1-5. [Crying] You were in the air for six hours, probably just a few rows from her and you never even knew she was your sister. [Sighs deeply] she was one of the ones who died when your plane hit the water. [Sighs] Her name was... Claire. [Sniffs] I didn't mean to burden you with this, but... you needed to know. I'm... sorry for your loss.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Carole walks away. Aaron fusses. Carole approaches Kate and Aaron. Aaron continues fussing.]
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAROLE	Your son is beautiful.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Aaron coos.]
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thank you.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at Kate in disbelief.]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Over on the freighter.]
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I don't understand. How'd you get back to New York?
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Uh, Walt and I, uh, uh... we took Ben's boat and we followed his bearing. A couple of days, we came to an island, you know, with people. I sold the boat... we hopped a cargo ferry back to the States. Didn't tell anybody who we were.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	And now you're working for Ben?
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I do not work for Ben. I'm trying to make up for what I did. I'm trying to help you out here. [He looks toward Jin]Translate what I said.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[In English] I understand.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Door clanks.]
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey! Michael! I need you now!
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael follows Desmond as he runs to a room below deck. Sun and Jin follow too. They come to a room filled with C-4 explosive.]
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oh, my God.
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢â€žÃªÂ¸Â° Ã«ÂÂ°Ã«Â¦Â¬ÃªÂ³ Ã¬Å“â€žÃ¬â€”Â ÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã¬â€žÅ“ ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«â€¹Â¤Ã«Â Â¤. Now.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Sayid are in the jungle.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Birds chirping.]
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's the matter?
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Birds chirping.]
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[sighs] These aren't Jack or Sawyer. They're different tracks, fresh... and they're doubling back behind us.
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Whoever you are, come out now!
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard emerges from the jungle.]
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	All right. All right, let's just relax. All right, let's--let's just rel--let's relax.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Stop! Stop!
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Just relax. Put the guns down. Pl--
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I said stop right there!
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Please just drop your guns.
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Take one more step--
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Guns cocking. Several "Others" appear from the forest. Kate gasps.]
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	I said drop your guns.
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I see two of them, but not the one who killed Alex.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He's there. Hold on to that for me, will you?
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Listen to me very carefully, John, because I'm not gonna have time to repeat this. You're gonna go into that greenhouse through that hole there. Once inside, you're gonna turn left. Go about 20 paces until you see a patch of anthuriums on your left. They're in an alcove against the north wall. Face the wall, reach down with your left hand. You'll find a switch that activates the elevator. The elevator takes you down to the actual Orchid station.
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Whoa. Wait. What?
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Okay, I'm sorry, Ben, but maybe I missed the part where you explained what I'm supposed to do about the armed men inside.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm gonna take care of them.
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And how the hell are you gonna do that?
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	How many times do I have to tell you, John? I always have a plan.
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Whispers] Ben! [Normal voice] Ben!
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben walks away. A montage follows. Sun on the freighter with Aaron. Jack and Sawyer leaving the helicopter. Sayid and Kate being escorted through the jungle by the Others. Ben stops inside the greenhouse. Rifle cocks. Ben approaches Keamy with his hands raised. Rifle cocks.]
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	My name is Benjamin Linus. I believe you're looking for me.
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Keamy points his gun at Ben's head for a moment before striking him with it.]
