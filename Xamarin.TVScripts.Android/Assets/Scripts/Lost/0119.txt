6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Locke's hand setting up a Mouse Trap game as an employee in a department store. A kid walks up.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KID	What's that?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	A game. It's my favorite game, actually. I used to play it with my brother. It's called Mouse Trap.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KID	How do you play?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, you start with all these parts off the board. And then, one by one, you build the trap - shoe, bucket, tub - piece by piece it all comes together. And then you wait 'til your opponent lands here on the old cheese wheel. And then if you set it up just right, you spring the trap. Go ahead, kiddo.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke sees a woman in a fur coat watching him, and goes over to talk to her.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	May I help you, ma'am?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	Yes, um, could you tell me where the footballs are?

24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks.

28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Locke at the hatch, wiping dirt from the glass.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You want my opinion?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Boone, you've got to have some faith. [Boone walks away.] All we've got to do is break the glass, and then we're in. The trebuchet delivers a half a ton of force.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Why do they call it a trebuchet? It looks like a catapult.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone and Locke are positioning the trebuchet to spring.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's called a trebuchet, Boone, because it's a trebuchet.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I don't get you, man. One minute you're quoting Nietzsche, now all of the sudden you're an engineer. I don't think I can spell trebuchet.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	There's a 't' on the end.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm serious, John. We've been coming out here everyday for 2 weeks-you never talk about yourself. Everybody's got a story.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	My story would bore you.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of the trebuchet arm being hoisted upward by Boone and Locke.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	3, 2, 1.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke releases the arm which falls onto the hatch but does no damage. The whole trebuchet breaks apart.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[angry] This was supposed to work. This was supposed to work!
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	John. Your leg, man.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a piece of metal sticking out of Locke's right leg. Locke pulls it out and sees that it's bloodied for 3 or 4 inches.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Are you okay?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[nonplussed] Yeah, I'm fine.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke bandaging his wound, then pricking the skin on his legs with a safety pin to check for feeling. Then holding a piece of burning wood from a fire to the bottom of his foot, but not feeling pain.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone and Locke are chopping wood to build another trebuchet.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	The trebuchet-why didn't it work?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I don't think that glass is going to break, man. Whatever it's made out of...
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Everything breaks if you apply the right force.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	So, we're just going to build another one of your inventions, hope it works this time.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's right.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What if it doesn't?
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then the Island will tell us what to do.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What's that?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I should get back there -- salvage those pieces.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Your leg okay?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's fine.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Locke in the store parking lot.]
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Hi John.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke greets the man. He finds a flier for a lost dog on his windshield, then sees Emily looking at him again. He follows her. He gets hit by a car backing up out of a parking space.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	You alright, John?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke manages to get up and continues following Emily.]

108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	I'm your mother.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke and Emily in a diner.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Look, miss, I don't know why you think I'm your son, or how you found me, but...
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	You're adopted, aren't you?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No. No, I was raised in a foster home. Well, several foster homes, actually. Look, I don't mean to be rude -- what do you want from me?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	I want to tell you that you're special, very special. You're part of a design. You do realize that, don't you? That our meeting, me finding you, this is a sign of things to come. Great things.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	My father, is he still alive?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	Still alive? Oh, John, don't you understand? You don't have a father. You were immaculately conceived.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Sawyer approach Sun at her garden.]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[with a leaf in each hand] Which one?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	That one.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're sure? Because this is the one I've been using and nothing's happening.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I'm sorry it's not helping.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[entering] What's not helping?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nothing. [to Sun] Thanks, anyway. Nice garden. [Sawyer exits.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What was that all about?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	He has headaches.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Doesn't he have, like, a truckload of aspirin stashed away somewhere?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	He says aspirin didn't help.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack shaving in a mirror at the caves. Kate enters.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Can I ask you a question? Say you're having bad headaches everyday...
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You okay?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, fine.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So, who are we talking about then, Kate?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh-huh.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I just think there might be something really wrong with him.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And what does he think?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He says he's fine, but...
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then he's fine.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, well, he could be playing it down. There could some...
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, Kate, I'd like nothing more than to check the guy out and make sure he's okay. But we both know all I'm going to get for my trouble is a snappy one-liner. And if I'm real lucky, a brand new nickname. I'm just over it.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke re-building the trebuchet. Boone enters.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're late.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Late for what?

182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sorry, what?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It's useless. You can't open that thing up. You say you can but you can't.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, don't tell me what I can't do.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Don't you get it? It's a dead end. You're not getting in.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's impossible. We didn't find this by accident. We're supposed to...
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Oh, we're supposed to. We're supposed to find this, right? We're supposed to open it, right? Then tell me something, John, if we're supposed to open it, then why the hell haven't we opened it yet?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The Island will send us a sign.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[sarcastically] The Island will send us a sign.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All that's happening now is our faith is being tested - our commitment! But we will open it! The Island will show us how!
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What kind of kind of sign will the Island send us? Huh, John?

246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRAINEY	Here's the thing -- your mother sought you out, so she's fair game. But this guy-maybe he doesn't even know you exist. I've done this enough times to know this stuff isn't meant to be, even though it may feel that way. But this probably won't have a happy ending. So, do you want it, or not?

634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You really saw it?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, I really saw it.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	How long do you think it's been there?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Doesn't matter. What's important is that we found it. What's important is what's inside it.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What is inside of it, John?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're going to have to climb up there for us and find out.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Locke and Cooper in the hospital right before the transplant surgery.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COOPER	You can still change your mind.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nah. They already shaved my back.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both laugh.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COOPER	I'm so thankful for you, John.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	This was meant to be.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	COOPER	See you on the other side, son.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack approaches Sawyer at the beach, carrying a box.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If you're looking for a stool sample, you can forget it.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You've been reading a lot since we came to the Island.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, so what?
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You, uh, you've got, uh, you've got hyperopia.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[nervous] Hyperopia? That's, uh, what is that?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're far-sighted.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Far-sighted?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] Yeah. It can develop later in life, especially when you add a new strain to the eyes like with reading.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hands Sawyer a pair of glasses from the box to try and holds a book up for Sawyer to read.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Blurry.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer tries a different pair.]
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Better or worse?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Worse.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets another, ugly, pair.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh-uh, no way.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer, it's not a fashion show.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The scene switches to Sayid melting 2 pairs of glasses apart and then putting the 2 different lenses together to make one pair for Sawyer.]
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a blurry sheet of paper that says: better or worse? Glasses come up and the image sharpens.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Har, har, very funny.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[walking by] Dude, it looks like someone steam rolled Harry Potter.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Jack are amused.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Jack] You love this, don't you?
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're welcome.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Boone climbing up to the plane while Locke looks on. Boone slips.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hang on.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone keeps climbing and gets inside the plane. He finds of map of Nigeria/Africa. The plane tilts, Boone falls, and a body falls on him. Boone screams.]
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Boone?! Boone?!
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I'm fine!
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke starts walking toward the plane.]
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Boone, what do you see?! Boone?!
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Want to know what's in your damn plane, Locke?!
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a crate with some Virgin Mary statues. Boone takes one and throws is down to Locke.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Here's your sign!
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The statue breaks open to reveal baggies of heroin.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	They're drug smugglers, Locke. Heroin, that's all that's in here!
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't understand. I don't understand.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone finds another map then looks at the instrument panel. He tries the radio and hears static. The plane starts toppling over, but stops.]
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Boone, Boone, get out!
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[into the radio] Hello. Hello. Anybody out there? Mayday, mayday.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Boone, there's no time! Get out now!
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADIO VOICE	Is someone there?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADIO VOICE	Repeat your transmission, please.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[overlapping with Boone] Boone, get out!
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RADIO VOICE	We're the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[overlapping] Get out now!
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane falls and flips over. Locke struggles to get up so he can carry Boone back to Jack.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack at the caves. Kate enters.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So, did you know before or after you asked him about his latest outbreak?
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'd answer that, Kate, but, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Of course. Thank you for helping him. I know it was probably the last thing you wanted to do.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I didn't do it for him.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[running in, carrying Boone] Jack, help!
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, no, no. Put him down up here. Alright, alright, that's it, easy. What happened?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	There was an accident. Boone fell off a cliff out near the place we were hunting.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack rips Boone's shirt open to reveal a big wound.]
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, I'm going to need some water, shirts, towels, anything that I can use to staunch the bleeding. Kate, now, please!
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke standing, looking on.]
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John, tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke?! Locke?! Locke?!
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke is gone.]
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Locke waking in the hospital after the transplant surgery. He looks over to see an empty bed next to him. A nurse is taking his pulse.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	I think what you did was so kind.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Where's my father?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Who?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We had the transplant together.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	I didn't know he was your father.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We don't have the same last name. Where is he?
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon. He went back home. He's under private care.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	But, that doesn't make any... Why? Did he leave me a message?
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	No, not that I know of. You just relax, Mr. Locke. I'm going to get you some juice.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke is in pain.]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	[entering] It was his idea. I'm sorry, John.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you doing here?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	I needed some money. He's always been good that way. Your father's always been generous.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You told me I didn't have a father.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EMILY	Well, he said that was the only way you would give it to him. It had to be your idea. He told me where to find you. He, he asked me to go see you. I wanted to see you.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[starts crying] This can't be happening. This, this is a misunderstanding. This can't-this can't happen to me. He wouldn't do this to me. [angry] He wouldn't do this to me!
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke gets up out of bed.]
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke driving up to the gate of Cooper's house.]

838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I know you're watching me. You can't do this.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EDDIE	John, please. Move your car.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke driving. He's very angry and hitting the rear-view mirror, the roof of the car. He stops the car and screams.]
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke in the jungle, kneeling, crying, and banging at the hatch.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I've done everything you wanted me to do, so why did you do this to me?!
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A light goes on inside the hatch.]
