6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack watches over an unconscious John in a hospital room.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke wakes.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Welcome back.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	I know you...
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack chuckles.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We were on the same flight back from Sydney. I met you in the baggage claim office, you had lost your knives. I'm Jack Shephard.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	What happened?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You were run down by a car. You just came out of surgery.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	Am I... am I alright?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Your dural sac ruptured, but I think I got everything back where it belongs.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack becomes more serious.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Mr. Locke, while I was operating I got a look at the initial injury to your spine, the one that put you in a wheelchair. And... I was hoping you could tell me how that happened.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	Why?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I think you're a candidate.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	A candidate for what?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	A new procedure. A surgery we're developing. And if it works it could restore feeling to your legs. In fact, you may even walk again. If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke, I think that... that I could fix you.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	No. Thank you.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks puzzled.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Now, there's minimal risk, and the benefit--
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	I said no, doctor.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Helen enters the room.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	John?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She runs to John and they embrace.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Oh John, this is the first time they let me see you. Are you okay?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	I'm fine.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Helen notices Jack.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Are you his doctor?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Thank you.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She embraces Jack.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Thank you. Thank you for saving him. Thank you.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and John exchange smiles.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack wakes up in an outrigger. He sits up and sees Sayid on the beach nearby.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Welcome to Hydra Island. At least you didn't have to paddle.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Hydra station, Widmore's team march the other survivors to the polar bear cages.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	Get in.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh-uh. No way I'm getting back in those cages.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	Well I've got the gun, so you--
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer quickly disarms Seamus.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Not anymore, doughboy.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A shot rings out, Widmore approaches Kate with a pistol.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Drop the gun! Put the gun down or I'll kill her!
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You ain't gonna kill anybody. Otherwise you wouldn't be throwin' us in a cage.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	I have a list of names. Ford, you're on it. As are Reyes and the Kwons. Kate Austen? She's not. It doesn't matter to me whether she lives or dies.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't listen to him.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer reluctantly hands the gun back to Seamus. Seamus strikes Sawyer with the gun, the survivors are locked in the cage.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	You may not believe it, but I'm doing this for your own good.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're right. I don't believe it.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore turns to his team.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Is the fence live yet?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAUL	They're saying about an hour...
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	We haven't got an hour! Tell them to work faster! He's coming...
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Bernard sits in his office working on a dental cast. Jack enters.]
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hello?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard does not hear him.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me? Hello?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard finally notices him.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh!
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sorry. There was no one out front and I heard the drill... do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, you can find him right here. And, if you're not a patient, you can call me Bernard.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They shake hands.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um, I'm a surgeon over at St. Sebastian, and I was hoping to get a look at one of your patient files.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	And which patient would that be?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	His name's John Locke, and our records said that you had done some emergency oral surgery on him about three years back.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	And what are you looking for exactly?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I want to know how he was hurt.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Do you mind if I ask you why you're so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um... he and I met about a week ago. We were on the same flight back from Australia--
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oceanic 815.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks shocked.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I sat across the aisle from you. If memory serves, you were flirting with my wife, Rose, while I was in the bathroom. It's pretty weird, huh?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Well, then maybe you're on to something here, hmm? Now, I can't break patient confidentiality and tell you something I shouldn't... but I can tell you that when I treated Mr. Locke, there was another man in the same accident with him.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That was three years ago... you just remember that?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Of course I do, Jack.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard hands Jack a piece of paper he has written on, Jack reads it.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Anthony Cooper...
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Good luck, doc. I hope you find what you're looking for.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack leaves.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack sits in the outrigger and speaks with Sayid.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What happened?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	There was a mortar attack. Widmore's people fired on us. Locke saved you.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid hands Jack a canteen and Jack drinks deeply.]
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What about the rest of your group? What happened to them?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle. It's just the three of us now.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why did he bring me here?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke appears suddenly.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because your friends got themselves captured. And now we're going to have to rescue them.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Rescue them from what?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Widmore has them in a cage about half a mile inland.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why would he--
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You know, I would ask him, except I don't think he's gonna give me a straight answer. But I can't imagine that his intentions are good. If we move right now, we can break your people out, run for the plane, and be off this island before Widmore knows what hit him.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They're not my people. And I'm not leaving the Island.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well Jack, I'm hoping you still change your mind about that. But your friends do want to leave. And since they just ran away from me, on my own boat, I'm gonna need your help convincing them that they can trust me.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why should I trust you?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because I could kill you, Jack. Right here. Right now. And I could kill every single one of your friends. And there's not a thing that you could do to stop me. But instead of killing you, I saved your life. And now I want to save them too. So will you help me?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Hydra station, the other survivors bide their time in the cage.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Feel like we're running in circles? Back in these cages... except last time the gun was to my head.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He wouldn't have killed me, James.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That cave I told you about... where all the names were written... your name was there too. But it was crossed out. He doesn't need you, Kate.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Jin talk nearby.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	So she's with your mother?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes. You saw her pictures? How?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Widmore's people found your camera on the plane. He showed me the pictures. Our daughter... she's so beautiful.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I have your ring.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She puts it on him and they kiss. The power suddenly goes out.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Uh-oh...
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore's team examine the pylons.]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	What happened?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Somebody shut it down? What's going on?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAUL	Somebody killed the power.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	Get a team to that generator now!
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sounds of the smoke monster are heard.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And we're dead...
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Widmore's team opens fire as the smoke monster attacks.]
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Go, go, go.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	Ahh!
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The smoke monster slams Seamus against the cage, killing him. Kate stares at the corpse.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I think I can reach the keys! [groans]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate reaches for the keys.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hurry! When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us!
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Well, I ain't waitin'!
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[reaching] Uh, damn it!
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frank begins kicking the door as Kate continues to reach for the keys, Jack suddenly appears and grabs the keys. He unlocks the cage.]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you doing here?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The smoke monster wails.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm with him. Come on.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They flee the cage.]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daytime, the survivors move through the jungle.]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How much further to the plane?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Say about a quarter mile. Just over that ridge.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So you're coming with us now?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going to take you to the plane but I'm not getting on it. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm... I'm not meant to go.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thanks for comin' back for us, doc. Appreciate it.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The survivors point their weapons upon hearing a rustling in the bushes. Sayid steps out.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, it's okay! Sayid's with us. He was the one who turned off the generators.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Great. The more the merrier.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We need to go. Locke's waiting.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They follow Sayid.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack speaks to a receptionist.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh, no. No I'm not. But--
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	May I ask the nature of the visit?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um...
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Helen walks by with some flowers.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Dr. Shephard?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	What are you doing here?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um... I'm here to see Anthony Cooper. Do you know him? Is that why you're here too?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	What do you want with Anthony?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I want to talk to him about the accident that he was in with Mr. Locke.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Uh... Dr. Shephard... just go.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, all I want to do is help him.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	I know. John told me about the operation. He doesn't want it.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why doesn't he want it?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Please Dr. Shephard, just leave this alone. You saved John's life. Why can't that be enough?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because it's not.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Moments later, Helen leads Jack through a room filled with elderly people. She approaches a man in a wheelchair.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	Hi.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She wheels the man over to Jack, the man stares blankly as she wipes drool from his lips.]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HELEN	This is Anthony Cooper. He's John's father.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Locke approaches the Ajira plane, some of Widmore's team appear.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WHEELER	Hey! Stop! Stop right there!
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They open fire on Locke who continues to advance unharmed and breaks the first man's neck. He collects the first man's gun and uses it to kill the second, takes this man's wristwatch and climbs makeshift wooden stairs to board the plane. He follows some wiring into an overhead compartment and removes an object. Outside, the survivors arrive.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Alrighty... let's see what it'll take to get this baby to fly.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They come across the dead henchmen.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son of a bitch!
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid examines the first body.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	His neck's been broken.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke descends from the plane.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's because I broke it. If it's any consolation, Widmore knew that I would kill these men.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What are you talkin' about?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They were only guarding the plane for show. If Charles had really wanted to keep me from actually getting on board he wouldn't have moved his little fences.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well... wait, now he wants us to leave the Island?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, Hugo. He wants to get us all in the same place at the same time... a nice confined space we have no hope of getting out of... and then he wants to kill us.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kill us with what?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	With this.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke removes an object from his bag.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Four bricks of C-4. I found them in one of the overheard compartments, wired to the electrical system of the plane. If we would've turned it on... boom.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	So what now?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We can't be sure he didn't put more explosives on the plane. It's not safe. If we're gonna leave the island, I think we have to take the submarine.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well that's what I've been saying all along.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, wait... he's not supposed to leave the island. I mean, Alpert said that--
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Screw Alpert. He ain't here.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer approaches Locke.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's twice you've saved our asses. Guess I was wrong about you.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Thank you, James.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke addresses the group.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That submarine is gonna be heavily defended. We're gonna need everyone.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll help you but, like I said, I'm not going with you.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Fair enough. Let's go.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As they set off, Claire catches up with Locke.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey... I'm sorry I--
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's alright, Claire. I understand why you went with them.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer hangs back to talk to Jack.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey doc, listen up... you don't wanna leave this island, that's your own damn business. But I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. I don't trust that thing one bit, so here's what I need you to do... once we get to the dock, you make sure it doesn't get on the sub.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How am I supposed to do that? You saw what it did back there.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just get it in the water, I'll take care of the rest.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - In the hospital, Jack watches over John as he rests after surgery.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	[groans]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	[loudspeaker] CT test to Trauma 3. CT test to Trauma 3.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Mr. Locke, are you awake?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	[eyes closed, groggy from surgery] Push the button.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[looking puzzled] Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	[eyes still closed] I wish you had believed me.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	[in hallway] Excuse me?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sees Claire near reception desk and goes to her.]
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Miss Littleton.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Dr. Shepard. I--I was just looking for you. The, um, the lawyer told me you were here.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They exchange smiles. Jack chuckles.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Um, c-can we talk?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes. Yes.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Snack machine whirrs as Jack pushes the button for an "Apollo" bar. He offers it to Claire.]
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, no. I'm okay. [chuckles]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry, I had to run out of the will-reading the other day, but I did have an emergency, and...
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, no worries. [clears throat] Um, I know this is as awkward for you as it is for me. Never even met this man.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire and Jack sit down. Claire holds a rectangular, white cardboard box in her lap.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Anyway, the, uh, lawyer gave me this. She said, uh, there'd be more stuff to come, but that my father especially wanted me to have this.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She takes a decorative, carved and inlaid wooden box from the white cardboard box.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Do you know why or what it's suppose to mean?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head and gestures with both hands.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I have no idea; but, then... I--I didn't know about you either.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Our father, uh... you mind, you mind if I ask how he died?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He was found in an alley outside a bar in Sydney. He drank himself to death. I flew down to bring his body back... but then, uh...[sighs] the airline lost it.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I just flew in from Sydney a few days ago.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh, last Wednesday?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[puzzled] Oceanic Flight 815?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh, yeah.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both look confused. Jack shakes his head.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you mind if I have a look at that? [Jack gets up and moves closer to Claire.]
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh, sure, go ahead.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sits next to Claire, takes the wooden box and opens it. Their smiling faces are reflected in a mirror, which is on the inside lid of the box. An instrumental version of "Catch A Falling Star" plays.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[sighs] I'm sorry. I--I wish I knew why he wanted you to have this. [closes the music box.]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, me, too. [puts the music box back into the white box.] Well, um. It was nice seeing you again. [They both get up.] Thanks for trying to help.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are you staying?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uh, just down the road...motel.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Jack	Why don't you come stay with me?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Stay with you? [Jack nods.] I mean, we're...we're strangers.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughs] No, we're not strangers. We're...we're family.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - The armed survivors, with Locke, Claire and Sayid, are hiding in the bushes, observing Widmore's seemingly undefended submarine. Locke tosses his backpack behind Jack.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the dock, doesn't mean they ain't on the sub. We're goin' in hard. Got it? Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun--you're with me. The rest of you wait 30 seconds, head down the dock behind us. [to Jack and Locke] You think you two can get our backs?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Absolutely.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All right. Let's go home. [runs toward sub]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer opens sub hatch, he goes down, followed by Lapidus, Sun hands them a rifle...]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[sub PA system] After engine room, power the bilges. After engine room, power the bilges, please.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Lapidus burst into a room, surprising a man sitting at a table.]
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where's the damn captain?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man leads them to the captain.]
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Put your damn hands up.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Lapidus knocks man unconscious with butt of rifle.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Nothin' personal.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, Hoss, how about you get ready to fire this thing up?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	[pointing gun at captain] I got it.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer leaves. The remaining survivors, Claire and Locke head toward sub.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Let's go.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke grabs both backpacks and hands one to Jack.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You sure you won't reconsider, Jack?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I'm sure.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Whoever told you, you needed to stay had no idea what he was talking about.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John Locke told me I needed to stay. [Jack pushes Locke off the dock and into the water.]
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A shot rings out and Kate goes down with a left shoulder injury.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate?!
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Sayid and Claire return fire at men hiding behind trees. Jack empties his gun, throws it down and lifts Kate.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Ahh.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid provides cover, while firing at the attackers.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Claire, let's go now! [Claire shoots a man out of a tree. Gunfire continues.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer hears the commotion above. Jack and Sayid help Kate into the sub. Locke climbs onto the dock with his backpack. Locke is unaffected by the bullets and kills the remaining gunmen. In the sub, Jack is supporting injured Kate as Sayid follows.]
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's going on up there? What happened?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Widmore's people shot her. Hurley, I need a first aid kit.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who else is up there?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Claire.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer goes to the surface.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Claire!
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	James!
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke shoots an approaching attacker. He exchanges stares with Sawyer, as Sawyer lowers the sub's hatch, Claire and Locke are left on the dock.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Lapidus, if you can hear me...DIVE! DIVE!
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	[to Captain] Let's go!
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Levers click, engines power on, Claire shoots another attacker, sees the sub leaving, drops her gun and runs toward sub.]
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hey! Wait! Wait!
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Claire! Claire! Wait! [Locke stops her]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What the hell are you doing?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What we came here to do...leaving.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's alright. It's alright.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No! They're leaving us.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No trust me. You don't want to be on that sub.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sub descends.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[gasping] Claire? Where's Claire?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She's still up there.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, we can't leave without her...we can't... [groans]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Jack	"Kate..." or "Okay".
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Is she gonna be okay?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack, can't find first-aid kit, dude.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jin--my pack. There might be a shirt in there I can use for pressure. [to Kate] It's okay. Just relax. Everything's gonna be alright.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Here. Can you help her? [hands Jack the backpack]
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I think the bullet went straight through...
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack reaches into his backpack.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER [reacting to Jack's fright]	What?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pulls out a C-4 bomb with a timer counting down from 3:54.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, where did that come from?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke. We did exactly what he wanted.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the submerged sub, Jack holds the bomb - 3:45 remains on the timer.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We have to get to the surface.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We have to get to the surface now!
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[on the telephone intercom] Lapidus, take us up.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	We're divin'!
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Just do it!
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	[grabbing captain, at gunpoint] You heard him. Up!
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid holds and studies the bomb - timer at 3:22, and counting.]
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude how'd that get on the sub?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[tending to Kate] Locke put it in my pack.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Why would he do that? He wanted to come with us?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Damn right he did, that's why I shut his ass out.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He wanted you to shut him out. [3:08 on timer] Any idea how that thing works? Can we turn it off?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This watch is jury-rigged to the battery. The battery detonates the explosives.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[on intercom phone] How much time till we're up, Frank?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	At least 5 minutes.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We ain't got 5 minutes. What's it gonna be Sayid?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	These wires--they're leads from the watch. If we disconnect them from the battery, technically speaking, the bomb should be inert.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Technically?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes, but you need to pull them out simultaneously; and, I'm not sure...
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Step aside.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[2:46 on timer - Sawyer makes a move toward the bomb, Sayid stands near alertly.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wait! Wait!
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell are you doin', doc?
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nothing's gonna happen.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't pull those wires out. We're okay. Nothing's gonna happen.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If I don't pull these wires, Locke's gonna blow us to kingdom come.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh...what?
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This is what he wanted. [2:27 on timer] This is what he's been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all in the same place, at the same time--a nice, enclosed space where we had no hopes of getting out of.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I don't understand.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke said that he can't leave the island without us. I think that he can't leave the island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill anyone of us whenever he wanted. So, what if he hasn't because he's...he's not allowed to. What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Stay out of my way, doc.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Timer at 1:54.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Now if he wanted that thing to blow up, why would he put a timer in it? Why not just throw it inside?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't care.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nothing is gonna happen.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's not your decision to make.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He can't kill us!
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[grabbing Sawyer] James. We are going to be okay. Just have to trust me.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[1:35 on timer.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sorry, doc, I don't.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pulls all the wires from the timer - Sun and Jack gasp - timer pauses at 1:31 and then countdown accelerates.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to Jack] Listen carefully. There's a well on the main island, half mile south from the camp we just left. Desmond's inside it. Locke wants him dead, which means you're going to need him. Do you understand me?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why are you telling me this?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Because it's going to be you, Jack.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid grabs bomb and runs off.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[heading toward Sayid] Sayid!
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid goes into another compartment and the bomb explodes - sub is flooding - alarm sounds - Lapidus gets up from the floor, climbs down ladder to access damage.]
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Ah, hell!
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A bulkhead hatch door gives way, knocking him to the floor. Jack grabs Kate from beneath the water - the group is disoriented and struggling.]
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you okay?
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What happened? Did Sayid just...?
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Help!
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Wait! [Sun is pinned against the wall] Hold on. I'll get you out...Sawyer! I need help!
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jin!
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley! Hurley! You gotta take Kate out of here.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What about everybody else?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll take care of them! [grabs an emergency air cylinder]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I have to go after Sayid!
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	There is no Sayid! Listen to me. Take this tank and buddy-breathe and swim out where the blast hole is, okay? Hurley, you can do this, okay?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Jack	Go!
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin and Sawyer try to free Sun - Hurley helps Kate and they flee the sub.]
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«â€žË†Ã«Â¬Â´ Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ­Å’Å’!
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Doc! [Jack joins them] Push.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	On three.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALL	One... two... three...
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grunts as some debris is removed, but Sun remains entangled - the sub rumbles and Sawyer is knocked unconscious by a falling piece of wreckage.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sawyer! Jack!
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs Sawyer from beneath the water.]
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer! Sawyer!
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin relentlessly struggles to free Sun.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Jin... Go!
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Save yourself.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I'm going to get you out of here. [to Jack, who has unconscious Sawyer] Go. Go. I'll get her free.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, we can do this!
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Just go! Save Sawyer.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[grabbing the last air cylinder] Jin take this. I can get him out without it.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No, you can't Jack. Just go! Go.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack reluctantly swims off with Sawyer, out of the sub through the blast hole.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[resurfacing after another attempt at freeing Sun] Ahh...Uhhh
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Jin. You have to go.
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No. I can do this.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	No. No, you can't. [crying] Please go.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[lovingly cupping Sun's face] I won't leave you.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin goes under attempting to free Sun as the water has now risen to neck level]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I'm gonna get you out of here.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[holds Jin's face imploringly] Go... Please! Go.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[helplessly looking around] Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã­â€¢ËœÃªÂ³ ÃªÂ°â„¢Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬Ââ€žÃªÂ²Å’. Ã«â€¹Â¤Ã¬â€¹Å“Ã«Å â€ Ã«â€“Â Ã«â€šËœÃ¬Â§â‚¬ Ã¬â€¢Å Ã¬Ââ€žÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼. [Subtitle: I won't leave you. I will never leave you again...] [in English] I love you, Sun. [they embrace and kiss]
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[crying] I love you.
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They embrace and kiss as water rises to their faces - the sub falls to the bottom of the ocean - completely immersed - the lifeless hands of Jin and Sun separate - Sun's body floats, her hair covering her face.]
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - John is being wheeled down the hospital hallway.]
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ORDERLY	Is somebody meeting you, Mr. Locke
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	Yes, my fiancÃƒÂ©e, Helen. She's, um...[distracted as he looks at Jin, with yellow flowers in hand, as they pass in the hallway] ...probably stuck in traffic... Hey, I'll take it from here. I'm pretty good at this.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ORDERLY	Well, the best of luck to you, sir.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	Thank you. See ya. [John wheels himself]
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Mr. Locke. I'm glad I caught ya. I hadn't have a chance to say goodbye yet.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	Well, goodbye..and thanks again, Dr. Shepherd. [they shake hands]
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[hesitating] I went to see your father.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	W-what?
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When you didn't want the surgery, I felt like I had to understand why...and, uh, I thought that if I could find out why you're in this chair, that maybe...
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	I was in a plane crash. I had my-my private pilot's license for a week, and, uh, I begged my father to be my first official passenger. He was terrified of flying. But, I looked him right in the eye--I told him that he could trust me. And we barely got off the ground. I still don't re--I don't remember what I did wrong, but it was my fault. It was my fault. This man, who I loved more than anything, will never walk, or talk or...
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know, the first time you and I met, uh, back at the--at the airport...you told me that my father was gone, and, uh, it hurt to hear that, but I knew you were right. Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	Uh, no, no, he's not.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes, he--he is, and you can punish yourself as much as you want and that's never gonna bring him back. What happened, happened...and...you can let it go.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	What makes you think letting go is so easy?
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's not. In fact, I don't really know how to do it myself. And, that's why I was hoping that…maybe you could go first.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHN	[laughs, chokes up] Goodbye, Dr. Shephard. [wheels away]
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[calls after him] I can help you, John...I wish you believed me.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[John stops briefly and is deep in thought, then wheels out of Jack's sight.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack struggles to get himself and Sawyer onto the beach - Jack is relieved when Sawyer coughs - Kate, aided by Hurley, join them.]
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack...I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you. [they embrace, Kate sobs]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Is he okay?
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He got hit in the head pretty hard, but he's breathing.
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What about Jin and Sun?
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head - Kate cries - Hurley sobs out loud - Jack walks away, stands in the ocean and is overcome by grief.]
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke looks out from the dock, looking fierce and frightful.]
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It sunk.
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What, the submarine? But, they-they were all on it, everyone... What? Th-they're all dead?
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Not all of them.
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke puts on his pack, grabs his rifle.]
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Wait. W-where are you going?
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	To finish what I started.
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He walks off and leaves Claire alone.]
