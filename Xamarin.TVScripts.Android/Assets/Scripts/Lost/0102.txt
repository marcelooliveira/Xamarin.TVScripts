10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate, Charlie, Jack walking in woods. No rain or clouds. Jack is trying the transceiver.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Anything?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You keep asking if there's anything.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Pardon me for appearing desperate, but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit, he did say that no-one's going to find us unless we … get that transceiver working. So... is there anything?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Charlie] What were you doing? In the bathroom?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I thought you could tell. I was getting sick. Puking. My one tangible contribution to the trek.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No. I'm glad you came. Charlie.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Every trek needs a coward.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're not a coward.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Long shot of Charlie's reaction. We hear a tapping sound.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Charlie on the airplane, tapping his ring against the seat's armrest, looking miserable.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	You all right, sir?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm good. Thanks.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Can I get you a water, or…
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[irritated] I'm fine. Thank you. Please?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[nodding, but looking unconvinced] All right.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie looking back down the aisle to see some Flight Attendants talking in the back of the plane. Cindy starts walking toward Charlie who bolts (this is where he bumps into Jack).]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Excuse me.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Guess he really had to go.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Sir, excuse me! [getting angry] Sir, excuse me!
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie's trying to get into a bathroom, but they are locked. He bolts again away from the flight attendants that are following him. He's goes through the row where Shannon and Boone are.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[annoyed] Excuse me?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The turbulence starts. Cindy reaches for an intercom panel.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie gets into a bathroom and locks the door. He takes off his shoe to reveal a baggy of heroin.]
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JD	[through the bathroom door] Sir, are you all right?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Just a minute. [Charlie takes some of the drugs. We hear knocking.] Just a minute.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JD	I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door, please.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie looking into the mirror with a drugged out/relieved look on his face. We hear more knocking.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JD	Open the door now, sir. Sir!
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie drops the drugs into the toilet, and reaches for the handle to flush the drugs away. Suddenly there's a big bump of turbulence, and Charlie goes flying into the ceiling. He opens the door and falls down, with a food cart rolling toward him. He rolls out of the way just in time, crawls to a seat and puts the seatbelt and oxygen mask on.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon sunbathing. Boone enters.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them. I see you found your bag. Come on, you want to give us a hand?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Not really. You're wasting your time. They're coming.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone walks away.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[sitting next to Shannon] Is that your boyfriend?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	My brother. Boone. God's friggin' gift to humanity.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I used to have a stomach.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You know what it is?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Not yet. I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of tide pool. Jin getting an urchin. Sun looking on. Michael enters.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Uh, excuse me. Hey, uh … have you, uh ... have you seen my boy?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â£â€žÃ¬â€ Â¡Ã­â€¢Â´Ã¬Å¡â€. Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬ËœÂÃ¬â€“Â´ Ã«ÂªÂ» Ã­â€¢Â´Ã¬Å¡â€. Ã¬â€¢â€ž … Ã¬Â â‚¬, Ã¬Â Å“ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬ËœÂÃ¬â€“Â´Ã«Â¥Â¼ Ã«ÂªÂ» Ã­â€¢Â´Ã¬Å¡â€.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Å“â€” Ã«â€¹Â¨Ã¬Â¶â€ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬â€”Â´Ã«Â Â¸Ã«â€žÂ¤. Ã¬Â±â€žÃ¬â€ºÅ’Ã«ÂÂ¼. Ã«Â¹Â¨Ã«Â¦Â¬!
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin motions for Sun to button her top button; Sun obeys.]
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm sorry. [Walks off camera] Walt! Walt?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Walt carrying a leash.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Vincent! Vincent! Come here, boy!
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt finds handcuffs lying on the ground.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[running up] Hey! What did I tell you? After everything that's happened!
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I thought that maybe Vincent would be around!
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I told you to stay on the beach!
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	This is so close to the beach, I thought this would be okay…
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Don't do that. You listen to me. I mean what I say. You understand?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt gives him a dirty look. Michael looks down to see the handcuffs in Walt's hands.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What is this?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I just found it.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael looks around, worried.]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[putting a protective arm around Walt] Come here.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a fight between Sawyer and Sayid on the beach. People standing around watching.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey guys. Come on, man. Hey.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. Break it up. Break it up! Come on! That's it! It's over! That's it!
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son of a bitch!
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm sick of this redneck!
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You want some more of me, boy?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Tell everyone what you told me! Tell them that I crashed the plane! Go on! Tell them I made the plane crash!
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The shoe fits, buddy!
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is going on?
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Ibn Al-Kalb!
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's going on?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[handing the handcuffs to Jack] Look, my kid found these in the jungle.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And this guy was sitting in the back row of business class, the whole flight, never got up. Hands folded underneath the blanket.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Oh.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And for some reason - just pointin' this out - the guy sittin' next to him didn't make it.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Thank you so much for observing my behavior.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid tries to get to Sawyer again to hit him.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on, bring it!
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[loud] Stop!
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid backs off.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We found the transceiver, but it's not working. Can anybody help?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes. I might be able to.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh great. Perfect! Let's trust this guy!
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! We're all this together, man. Let's treat each other with a little respect.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Shut up, Lardo.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey! Give it a break.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Whatever you say, doc. You're the hero.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You guys found the cockpit? [Jack nods] Any survivors?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[looking at the transceiver] It's dual band, military spec. Chances are, the battery is good, but - the radio is dead.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Can you fix it?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I need some time.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	[approaching] Doctor, the... man with the shrapnel, I... I think you should take a look at him.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid sitting on the beach, opening the transceiver. Hurley enters.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Tsss. Chain-smoking jackass...
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Some people have problems.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Tsss. Some people have problems? Us. Him. You're okay. I like you.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're okay, too.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[laughs] Hurley. [He reaches out to shake Sayid's hand, then sees he's busy with the transceiver and puts it down] Uh, just…
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[reaching to shake hands] Sayid.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How do you know to do all that?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I was a military communications officer.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh yeah? You ever see battle?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I fought in the Gulf War.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the 104th airborne. What were you - Air Force... Army?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The Republican Guard.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of the ocean. Kate is bathing.]
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€¹Â¤Ã«Â¡â‚¬Ã­â€¢Â©Ã«â€¹Ë†Ã«â€¹Â¤. Ã¬Â¤â‚¬Ã«Â¹â€ž Ã«â€¹Â¤ Ã«ÂÂÃ«â€šËœ Ã«Â´ÂÃ¬Å¡â€. Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã¬Ââ€ž Ã¬Â°Â¾Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Å¡â€.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun points to indicate that Kate is wanted somewhere.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate walking to Sayid on the beach, drying her hair.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Is it working?
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Seems to be. Except we're not picking up a signal.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why do we need to pick up a signal? Aren't we trying to send one?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars. The bars would show the radio is getting reception.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We need the bars.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We could broadcast blind... Hope that someone-maybe a ship somewhere-picks up our distress call. But that could be a waste of the battery, which might not last that long. There is one thing we could try...
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Seeing if we can get a signal from high ground.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How high?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid looks up. Camera pans high up the mountain.]
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Marshal Mars with shrapnel, Jack is working on him. Suddenly Kate is there, and Jack seems surprised.]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How is he? Can you do anything?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Pull out the shrapnel.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	But you said yesterday that if you took it out...
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know. But that was yesterday. I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now. If I leave him like this, he'll be dead within a day. If I open him up... if I can control the bleeding and if he doesn't go into sepsis and if I can find some antibiotics... he might be all right.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm going on a hike.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it. Not from here.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, wait a minute.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're the one who said that we had to send out a signal.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, you saw what that thing did to the pilot.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I did. What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wait for me. I don't know how long this will be... [he look at Marshal Mars.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sayid said the batteries won't last.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All right. If you see, or hear, anything... Anything. Run.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sun and Jin at the beach. Jin is cutting up the urchin. Sun reaches for a piece and he slaps her hand. He takes off with a tray of it. She looks disgusted and undoes her top button.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jin offering urchin to Hurley.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's that? What, that? What, eat that? [laughs] Dude. Dude. I'm... starving... But, I'm nowhere near that hungry. [laughs] No. No. No, thank you! No way, no. [laughs]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of comic book with polar bear. Comic book is in Spanish.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	The comic's in Spanish. You... read Spanish?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	No. I found it.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Tell you what: We get home... I get you another dog.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt walks away. Shot of Charlie getting his drugs out. Then we see Hurley on the beach, Jack comes up.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey! I need your help.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I need you to help me go through the luggage. I need any kind of prescription medications you can find. Especially drugs that end in -mycin and -cillin. Those are antibiotics.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's this for?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Charlie doing drugs. Then of Shannon almost crying. Boone comes up.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What are you doing?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I think I was mean to him.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Isn't that the guy from the gate? He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class. He saved our lives.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Come on, Shannon, we're trying to clear some of the wreckage. You should help out. You're just being worthless over here.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I'm being what?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What do you want me to say? You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I've just been through a trauma here, okay?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We've all been through a trauma. The only difference is, since the crash, you've actually given yourself a pedicure.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it. I get it.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I wish I didn't have to waste my time making fun of you. I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Screw you, you do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I have a much better idea than you think I do.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	No, you don't!
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Okay, Shannon. Then what are you thinking?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon sees Kate and Sayid preparing to leave.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I'm going with them. On the hike.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yup. I'm going.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	No, you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	[approaching Kate and Sayid] I'd like to come with you.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	She's not going. She doesn't want to go.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	The hell I'm not.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It's what she does. She postures.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You don't know what the hell I do!
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Makes really bad decisions to upset her family, which, at the moment, is me.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Shut up, and stop trying to be charming. [to Kate and Sayid] I'm coming with you.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't... know if that's such a good idea.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What are you? Two years older than me? Please. [to Charlie who has entered] You're going, aren't you?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, are you?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yup.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, I'm definitely going.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to Shannon] You couldn't tell from that, but she's actually really nice.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer smoking, reading his letter. He sees the others walking off.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the "hikers" in the jungle and Sawyer is closing up to them.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You decided to join us.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of them making their way up a steep mountain.]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael on the beach where Walt left him. Jack comes into the frame and opens a make-up type bag, looking for something.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What you're looking for?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Some sort of blade. How's your son?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How old is he?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Nine... Ten-Ten. Walt's more worried about his dog than anything. The dog was on the plane, so... Kids, you know.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is it a Lab?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah? I saw him yesterday, in the jungle.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What? Where?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Over there. Couple hundred yards in or so. He looked good.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack finds a straight-edge razor. Shot of Locke with the Backgammon pieces. Walt approaches, curious.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What is it, like checkers?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Not really, it's a better game than... checkers. You play checkers with your Pop?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	No. I live in Australia with my mom.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You have no accent.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Yeah, I know. We move a lot. She got sick. She died a couple of weeks ago.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're having a bad month.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I guess.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Backgammon is the oldest game in the world. Archeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins of ancient Mesopotamia. Five thousand years old. That's older than Jesus Christ.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Did they have dice and stuff?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[nods] Mhhm. But theirs weren't made of plastic. Their dice were made of bones.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Cool.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Two players. Two sides. One is light... one is dark. Walt, do you want to know a secret?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Claire writing in her diary. Jin approaches and offers her some urchin. She shakes her head, but then gives in and takes some.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No. Tha- thank you. No, it's okay. [Jin keeps insisting] No, really. Okay. Thanks.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She eats some and then feels her baby move. She jumps up and makes Jin touch her belly.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, gosh. I just felt it. I ju … Come here, feel this. Please. [Jin resists, but Claire keeps insisting]. Please. Please. Do you feel that? There! Right there, that's a kick! There! There, right there's a foot! Oh no, he's, wait, he's moving around. "He". "He". I guess I think you're a "he".
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of group in jungle.]
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay! Wide open space! You should check the radio, see if we're good.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're not going to have any reception here.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just try it.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't want to waste the batteries.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm not asking you to keep it on all day.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're still blocked by the mountain.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Just check the damn radio!
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If I just check.. we might not have any juice left when we get to...
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all turn toward a sound they hear. Sounds of growling, movement.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	My god.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What the hell's that?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Something's coming.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's coming towards us, I think.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Come on, let's move.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all start running off.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	I shouldn't have come. Aah!
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Go! Go!
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of them running, but Sawyer stands and faces the bear.]
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[turning to go back] Sawyer!
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[grabbing Kate] Let him go!
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pulls out a gun and shoots serveral times. The bear drops just as it almost gets to Sawyer.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	That's... that's a big bear.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You think that's what killed the pilot?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks at Charlie.]
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No. No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Guys, this isn't just a... bear. That's a polar bear.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack and Hurley with Marshal Mars getting ready to take out the shrapnel.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You sure he's out?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's out.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, guy, are you awake? Yo, there's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yaaay! [Marshal Mars doesn't react at all.] Yeah, he's out. So-what do you want me...
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, it's unlikely that he'll regain consciousness. But the pain might bring him around. And if it does, I need you to hold him down.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then don't look.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah. But.. I'm not so good around blood.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just do the best you can. Okay? Don't look.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay [looks like he's praying or something, mumbling something to himself].
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pulls the shrapnel out.]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hand me those strips.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just hand me the strips, I need to get this bleeding stopped.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't think I can.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	"Oh" what? What, what's going on, something in there? [Hurley looks down]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The strips. Just hand me the strips. Give it to me. [Hurley looks sick.] Don't even think about it, Hurley. Don't even think a... Hurley! Hey! [Hurley passes out on the Marshal] Damn it!
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of the group in the jungle.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	That can't be a polar bear.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID and KATE	[at the same time] It's a polar bear.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah, but... Polar bears don't usually live in the jungle.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Spot on.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, polar bears don't live near this far south.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	This one does.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Did. It did.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Sawyer] Where did that come from?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Not the bear. The gun.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I got if off one of the bodies.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	One of the bodies.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, one of the bodies.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	People don't carry guns on planes.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They do if they're a US Marshal, sweet cheeks. There was one on the plane.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How do you know that?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so I took the gun. I thought it might come in handy. Guess what? I just shot a bear!
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So why do you think he's a Marshal?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because he had a clip-on badge. [Sawyer holds up a badge] I took that too. Thought it was cool.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I know who you are. You're the prisoner.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm the what?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You found a gun on a US Marshal. Yes, I believe you did. You knew where it was, because you were the one he was bringing back to the States. Those handcuffs were on you. That's how you knew there was a gun.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Piss off.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That's who you are, you son of a bitch.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	But you are the prisoner.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Fine! I'm the criminal. You're the terrorist. We can all play a part. [to Shannon] Who do you want to be?
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Sawyer turns, Kate grabs the gun and points it at him.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Does anybody know how to use a gun?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I think you just pull the trigger.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Don't use the gun.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I want to take it apart.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	There's a button on the grip. Push that, it will eject the magazine. [Kate follows Sayid's instructions.] There's still a round in the chamber. Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate follows Sayid's instructions and gives the magazine to Sayid and the gun to Sawyer.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[grabbing Kate's arm] I know your type.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm not so sure.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah. I've been with girls like you.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No girl's exactly like me.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks off a ways.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of Kate on the plane.]
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHELLE	Can I get you a refill?
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, I'm... I'm fine with this, thank you.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHELLE	You, sir? Can I get you anything? Cocktail? Soda?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHELLE	[looking disgusted] Coffee. Sure.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	You look worried. I'd be worried too, I was you. But you've got to stay positive, kiddo. You know, there's always that off chance that they'll believe your story. I know I sure do.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't care what you believe.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Oh, I know. That's true. That has always been true. You sure you don't want some more juice?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I'm sure.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate with hands cuffed. Then the turbulence starts to happen.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[on the intercom] Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I have one favor to ask.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Really? This ought to be good. What...
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The turbulence causes the big drop with a woman hitting the ceiling. A big black/silver case hits the Marshal on the head. He passes out. The masks come down and Kate can't reach because of the handcuffs. She gets the key from the Marshal's pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. She puts her mask on and then puts a mask on the Marshal. The back of the plane rips off.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Cut back to the group standing on the hill.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We should keep moving.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack with the Marshal. The Marshal wakes up and grabs Jack's shirt.]

660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARSHAL	Where is she?
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate walking with the group. Sayid getting the transceiver out.]
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh! Now's a good time to check the radio! Not before.. but now!
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're up higher.

676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Feedback.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Feedback from what? What would do that?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll tell you what would do that. This guy not fixing the radio. This thing doesn't even work.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken. We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Transmitting from where?
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Somewhere close. The signal's strong.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Somewhere close? You mean on the Island? That's great!
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Maybe it's other survivors.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	From our plane? How would they even-
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What kind of transmission is it?
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal...
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Can we listen to it?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Let me get the frequency first. Hold on.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	There's no transmission.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Shut up.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	The rescue party. It has to be. [They hear the transmission]. It's French! The French are coming! I've never been so happy to hear the French!
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I never took French. What does she say?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	D-Does anybody speak French?

758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We can hear some of the transmission: Il est dehors.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	It's... it's repeating.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	She's right.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	What?
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's a loop. "Iteration"-it's repeating the same message. It's a counter. The next number will end... "533".

770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Does anyone know what the hell he's talking about?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so... how long... [we see him trying to figure it out in his head].

806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Maybe they came for them.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If someone came, why is it still playing?
