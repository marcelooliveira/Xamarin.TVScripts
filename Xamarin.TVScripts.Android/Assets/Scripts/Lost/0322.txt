6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A heavily bearded Jack sits on a plane sipping a drink, as a stewardess walks down the aisle.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STEWARDESS	Would you fasten your seat belts? Would you put your seat belt back on, please?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Oh.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STEWARDESS	Would you fasten your seat belt, please?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack taps her on the back.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. [Hands her his empty glass] Can I get another one of those, please?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STEWARDESS	I'm sorry, sir. We'll be landing in 20 minutes.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, 20 minutes is a long time.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STEWARDESS	[Hands him a newspaper] How about a newspaper instead? ... And if you could buckle your seatbelt, sir?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She moves on.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STEWARDESS	Please fasten your seatbelt. Thank you.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane shakes with turbulence. A tannoy bell sounds.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAPTAIN	Sorry about the bumps, folks, we're just hitting a little warm air as we make our descent into Los Angeles. Please keep those seatbelts fastened and we'll have you on the ground shortly.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at the newspaper and notices something which seems to upset him. He rips out part of the paper.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack drives over a bridge and stops on the side. He looks at the paper clipping and cries with his head on the steering wheel. He gets out his phone and dials.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICEMAIL	You've reached three one zero five five five zero one four eight. Please leave a message.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. It's me. I, er, I just read... [hangs up]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack steps out of the car and climbs up a ledge on the side of the bridge, looking over to a steep drop to solid concrete. He takes a deep breath.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, forgive me.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At that moment, sounds of a swerving car can be heard behind him, and a loud collision and smashed glass. The light of a fire brightens Jack's face, and a honk beeps continuously.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KID	Mom! Mom! Mom!
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MOTHER	Help!!!
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KID	Mom!
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack heads toward the incident.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - The beach camp are all set to leave. Jack nods to Kate, who then looks at Sawyer with a long face. Jack heads to see Sayid]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You have everything you need?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, but I made the best out of what we have.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Bernard and Jin?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They watch Bernard load a gun, while Jin speaks with Sun.]
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	They're both excellent shots...and highly motivated. The dynamite's in place. We won't miss. Jack, no matter what happens here, I want you to keep moving; keep moving for that radio tower. Don't turn back for any reason. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, but I'm not giving it up for nothing. You understand?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Nods] Yeah. I understand.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They shake hands.]
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And good luck.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You too.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose prepares to leave and heads over to Bernard.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	If I told you that I'd help you with your SOS sign, would you change your mind?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	No ma'am.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Then I want you to say it again.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Rose-
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Say it, Bernard.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I am a dentist. I am not Rambo.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	And don't you forget it.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hug. Rousseau watches Hurley as he holds Aaron, smiling.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Charlie's gonna be fine.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah. 'Course he is.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin intimately speaks with Sun.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Å¾Â­ Ã¬Ëœâ€ Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬â€žÅ“ Ã«â€“Â¨Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Â§â‚¬Ã¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«Â§ÂÃªÂ³Â , Ã­â€Â¼ÃªÂ³Â¤Ã­â€¢ËœÃ«Â©Â´ ÃªÂ¼Â­ Ã¬â€°Â¬Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«ÂÂ¼. [Subtitle: Stay close to Jack, and rest if you feel tired.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â§â€žÃ¬Ë†Ëœ Ã¬â€Â¨... Ã¬â„¢Å“ Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å¸Â¬Ã«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬Å¡â€? [Subtitle: Why are you doing this?]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Because...we have to go home.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun cries and they kiss, Juliet watches further away stood with Naomi.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To the group as a whole] All right. Let's do it.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau leads on as almost the entire camp start following. Sayid, Bernard and Jin stand by themselves further away.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau leads the survivors along the shoreline.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Jack. Can I ask you a question?
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sure.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	What did you do for a living before you became Moses?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Laughs] I was a doctor.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Right, course you were. Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi looks at Juliet, who has stopped with Jack.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	[To Jack] Is she OK?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why wouldn't she be?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Because none of your people trusts her. No offense.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[To Jack] You know what why don't you catch up to me when you're done.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet...
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's fine.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She moves on.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	[Pulls out her phone] So, I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works in case anything happens to me. You need to be able to call my boat.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	OK. Show me.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	It's actually simple. You turn her on here. This opens a direct channel to the freighter. Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep, and say hello.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And that's it?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	That's it. Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption's jamming us up, this red light will turn a lovely shade of green. That'll be any time now, yeah?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hopefully.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the Looking Glass station, the blonde woman hits a tied-up Charlie.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BLONDE WOMAN	Who are you?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	Look, if you tell us how you got down here, we won't hurt you.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I came in my invisible submarine. Don't you see it?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The blonde woman hits Charlie again.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	Hey! Take it easy.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BLONDE WOMAN	Take it easy? He's one of them. Why are you here, huh? How did you find out about this station?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Juliet told us. She's one of us now. In case you haven't heard.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The blonde woman hits Charlie again.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	Stop. We gotta call Ben.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh yeah. Let's call Ben.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BLONDE WOMAN	Come on.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The two women go into a small communications room. Charlie watches and remembers Desmond's words.]
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light, above a switch...
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie sees the light in the room.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	... You flick the switch, light goes off. Then you drown.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Others camp, Ben is writing in his diary when he receives a transmission on his walkie.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BLONDE WOMAN	Come in. Come in, Ben.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BLONDE WOMAN	Ben, it's Bonnie. Ben, are you there? Can you hear me, Ben?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail and Richard are playing chess, and notice Ben on his walkie outside for signal.]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Why are you breaking radio silence?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	One of them's down here.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm sorry, what?!
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	We have him tied up but he's here. One of them swam down here.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who? Which one?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	He won't tell us.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Overhearing] It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	How did... how does he know about the station?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	He said Juliet told them.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	All right, sit tight, don't do anything, I'm sending help. [To Mikhail] Mikhail you need to go down to the Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	You told us The Looking Glass was inoperable. Flooded.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I can be there by dawn. But if Juliet told them about the Looking Glass, what else did she tell them?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail goes, as Ben fiddles with his walkie.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, Ryan's walkie is off as he looks at the quiet camp with binoculars.]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Your walkies all off?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Yes, sir.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A female Other approaches.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Did you get a good look?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE OTHER	The tents are marked with white coral, three of 'em. Juliet did her job.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	All right, let's do this.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The Others advance as a unit, and fan out to the three tents. Sayid, Bernard and Jin are all at their vantage points waiting. Sayid waits until the Others literally pull back the sheets inside his marked tent.]
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE OTHER	It's empty!
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Get away from the tent!
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid fires, and the tent explodes, knocking down at least three Others.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	It's a trap! Move!
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Please, God.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard fires, and at least another two Others are thrown across the beach by the explosion. Jin aims and fires his short barreled handgun, but misses the dynamite. He fires again, but still misses.]
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE OTHER	Tree line!
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin is shot at numerous times. He counters and shoots two of them down. He crawls out from his vantage point but is knocked down by the blunt end of Ryan's shotgun.]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	I got your man! Drop your weapons!
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bernard runs for the jungle, but is clotheslined by Tom, and kicked unconscious.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	I got your man!
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid has his sniper scope dead on Ryan as he approaches with his gun at Jin's head.]
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	It's over!
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid prepares to pull the trigger but feels another gun against his own head. Another male Other has survived the attack.]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE OTHER	Don't. Finger off the trigger.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid does so.]
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles away, the main group watch the smoke rise from the beach.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	There were supposed to be THREE explosions.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[To Jack] It didn't work.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack is in a hospital.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TANNOY	Doctor Leon to surgery, Doctor Leon to surgery.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is having stitches put in on a cut on his forehead by a female doctor.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOCTOR	There you go. Good as new.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOCTOR	The news people are waiting for you outside. You being a hero and all.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Right. The woman, how is she?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOCTOR	She's been stabilized. Thank god you were on that bridge.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Right.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sarah Shephard enters.]
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOCTOR	Sorry, no visitors in ER.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's OK. She... we used to be married.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOCTOR	Come on in.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The doctor leaves.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	What happened?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We saw... a car accident.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	Are you OK?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Yeah I'm fine.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	Are you drinking again?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	Are you, Jack?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. Why did you come down here, Sarah?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	Erm, I'm still your emergency contact. What were you doing driving around at two o'clock in the morning?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You think maybe you could give me a lift home?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	I don't think that would be appropriate.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, thanks for coming down, Sarah.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SARAH	Goodbye, Jack.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She leaves.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack continues to watch with the rest of the group the smoke rising from the beach.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Why were there only two explosions?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Maybe they didn't have to blow the third tent.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	But those gunshots, what was that all...
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's OK, Rose.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Do you believe that?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Listen, they had no idea that we were waiting for them. And Sayid's with your husbands, they're gonna be fine and they're gonna be a couple of hours behind us.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Then we should wait for them here. You go on...
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. No-one gets left behind.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	If you say live together die alone to me Jack, I'm gonna punch you in your face.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Laughs] Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough. [To the group] But we have a plan. And for all we know, it worked. It's gonna be OK, everything's gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, OK?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They do so.]
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[To Rose] It's OK, let's go.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi looks at her phone, which is still beeping red.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Looking Glass, Bonnie and the brunette woman continue to question Charlie.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm here, to turn off your jamming equipment. It's in there, next to the flashing yellow light.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	How do you know about that?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I know, because I know. Whatever you ladies do to me, I'm going to turn it off.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	You are, huh?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Most definitely am.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	So what's the code?
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Oh Charlie if you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment you're gonna need the code. And only three people know it. Me, her and Ben.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, guess I won't need the code. Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway. I just turn off your little jammer and the helicopters come and rescue all my friends.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	But if this station floods, what happens to you?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I die.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben uses his walkie at the Others' camp.]
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	They're all dead. Diane, Ivan, all of em, dead. And Shephard and his people, they're all gone.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Gone, gone where?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	I dunno. Did you hear me? They killed seven of our-
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Tom! Calm down and tell him the good news.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What good news?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	We caught three of 'em. The one's who stayed behind to blow up the tents. Ben, they knew we were coming.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	It was Juliet. She betrayed us.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Just figure out where she is, Tom.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	[To Sayid] Get up.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pulls him up.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	OK, junior, where the hell did-
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid spits in his face, and Ryan hits him hard over the head with his handgun.]
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	They're not talking.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Who do you have?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Shoot Kwon.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	If you want them to answer questions, kill Kwon. Do it now.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Â§â‚¬Ã¬ËœÂ¥Ã¬â€”ÂÃ«â€šËœ Ã«â€“Â¨Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Â Â¸Ã«ÂÂ¼. [Translation not shown: Go to hell.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	I dunno what that means, but I'm sure it's lovely.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He cocks his gun.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	No, wait. No.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No. No talk.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	No please.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	You talk to me, nobody will get hurt. Now tell me where your people are.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He's lying, he's going to kill us all any-
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid is kicked down.]
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Where are they?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Short pause. Ryan puts his gun at Jin.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Sayonara.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	A radio tower. They're hiking to a radio tower.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Why in the hell are they going there?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	A woman, parachuted here. She has a satellite phone and they're gonna call her ship.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[On walkie] Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow. So why were they waiting for us tonight?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	[To Bernard] You heard him. How'd you know?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	A kid, told us, he came in a canoe, and he warned us.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What kid?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Karl. He said his name was Karl.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	You heard that, Ben? [Pause] Ben?!
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I heard.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben looks out of his tent and stares at Alex.]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What do you want us to do, kill 'em?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No. Not yet.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the morning, Ben draws a line to the radio tower on a map, as Richard watches.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	We're going to the radio tower?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Not we, Richard, me. You're going to take everyone to the Temple as planned.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Now might not be the best time to go tromping off on your own.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Oh really and why not?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Because people are asking questions, Ben. About leaving home, about what happened to Locke, about Jacob. Not to mention the rapidly spreading rumor that everyone that went down to the beach is dead.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	They're not all dead.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben gets up to get some things.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Where are you going?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Alex.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	I asked where you were going.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well I thought I might go for a walk! See if I can't find Jack and all his friends.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	[Defiantly] I'm coming with you.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	All right.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	[Surprised] What?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I said all right. In fact I think it's a good idea. I mean you do want to see Karl again, don't you? [Pause] Get your pack, I'm leaving in 10 minutes.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	There's 40 of them. And you're alone. They're gonna do whatever it takes to get off the Island. What do you think is gonna happen when you get there?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm going to talk them out of it.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, the group have stopped to collect some water from a stream. Rose and Sun share anxious looks. Kate goes to speak with Sawyer.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Something's wrong.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Lots of things are wrong, Kate.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jin, Bernard and Sayid... they should have caught up to us by now. I want to go back to make sure they're all right.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	'Course you do.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's that supposed to mean?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It means, Kate, there's always someone to go back for.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's the matter with you?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nothing.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[Sarcastically] Nothing?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm fine.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why don't you just tell me what happened?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pauses, and Kate splashes him with water from the stream.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What you do that for?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	To wake you up. Ever since you got that tape from Locke it's like you've been sleepwalking. You don't care about our friends, fine, but it's like you don't care about anything anymore. And since when did you start calling me Kate?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer starts to go.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You know. They sent Juliet to check out Sun, but she was there to check and see if I'm pregnant too.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, let's hope you're not.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer goes, giving Jack a brief look. Jack walks over to Naomi who is holding the satellite phone.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The light's still red?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi nods.]
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Out on the canoe, Desmond wakes up slowly. He looks over the edge where Charlie dove down. Suddenly, he takes cover as he is attacked by gunfire. On the shore, Mikhail is shooting at him at range. Desmond dives down to escape the bullets, and swims up into the moon pool at the station. Inside, Bonnie and the brunette woman are arguing in the comms room with the door closed as Desmond emerges from the water.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Des. Des!
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide, Des, hide, hide, there's people in there! Quick, hide hide hide. Go go go! Hide hide hide.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The women hear him.]
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Who's he talking to?
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Singing] I feel like standing... stupid people...
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Who are you talking to?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I wasn't talking to anyone, I was just singing. [Sings] You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody!
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bonnie hits Charlie across the face.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Shut up.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right, OK, you got it.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	[To brunette woman] Come on.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They go back into the comms room. Charlie looks over. Desmond is hiding in a locker/behind a door nearby.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack is in the hospital. Jack stands at the foot of a patient's bed looking at their chart. His hand shakes, and he takes a pill as a male doctor enters]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE DOCTOR	Can I help you?
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just checking her chart.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE DOCTOR	I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill, Rob. The new chief of surgery. I don't think we've met yet.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jack Shephard.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	Dr. Shephard, the hero? Twice over.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He gestures his hand to shake, and Jack reluctantly does so.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	You all right? After last night I'm surprised that you'd even want to come in. Talk about right place right time, huh? This woman is very lucky you were there.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If she was lucky she wouldn't have a fractured back that was impinging upon her spinal cord. I'd like to operate first thing in the morning.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	You want to operate?
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	I'm sorry, Jack, but this isn't your patient. And we are well aware of the issues, Gary Nadler is doing the surgery at 6 a.m..
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Pauses] With all due respect, Doctor Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	Jack. Last night you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son out of a burning car, then you went back for her. I think you've done enough.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I want to do the surgery.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	Look. Everything's under control. She'll be fine. Go home, have a drink. You deserve it.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pauses]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	The chart please, Jack.

The victims were later transported to Saint Sebastian Hospital. Further details of their conditions have not yet been....

638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm going back.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm going back to the beach.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No way. We keep moving.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't asking permission.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet and Kate both stop also.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[To Jack] Look, you got a job to do here. I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it. And you sure as hell don't need me.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you think you're gonna get done. Alone and unarmed.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He won't be alone, I'll go with him.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No!
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Twenty minutes ago you weren't even interested in going, and now all of a sudden you're telling Jack that I'm-
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I didn't wanna go with you.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer, it's a suicide mission without guns.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I know where there are some guns. There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here. I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet, you don't have to do that.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let's do this.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer goes.]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Juliet] Don't do anything stupid.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I won't if you won't.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She kisses him, Kate watches.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Don't wait up.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She leaves, and Jack sees that Kate was watching.]
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the underwater station, Charlie hums while Desmond still hides.]
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Sings and hums inaudibly]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	AH!! I told you to shut up!!!
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know when you get a tune stuck, in your head? This song just started coming to me, it's almost finished. Just need to find the bridge. [Hums and sings inaudibly again]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Get the speargun!
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	What, why?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Cause I want it to hurt.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	No, Ben said-
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	You don't want to get it, I will.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bonnie heads to where Desmond is hiding.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	Bonnie.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oi, oi, oi, no! I'll, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail suddenly emerges from the water with diving gear.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Mikhail?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I thought you two were on assignment in Canada?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	He made us promise not to tell anyone.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hello again.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Where is the other one?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	What?
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	This idiot swam down from a boat. I was just shooting at his friend. He dove down here.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	He's alone.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Are you sure about that?
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail approaches Charlie with a knife.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops. Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't. Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the Island.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	What? Is that true?
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A bleeping sound can be heard from the comms room.]
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BRUNETTE WOMAN	That's Ben.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	[Holds up his knife] I'll get it.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, Ben talks to Mikhail on his walkie as he and Alex walk.]
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You have to understand, everything I did, I did for the Island.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	The Island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Yes it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail, now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do this.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because this Island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many many years. And we are meant to protect it, Mikhail, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	So why not trust me?
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Mikhail, are you still there?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Yes.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all costs. And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others about what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them too.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Alex looks shocked.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because if I had, Mikhail, you'd already be dead.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail thinks.]
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Out in the jungle, Juliet and Sawyer head for the beach.]
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So, when you pulled us out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang, what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for anyway?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We were building a runway.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Runway, for what?
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Turns to him] The aliens.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She smirks.]
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I don't know what for, do you think they told me everything?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. So you screwing Jack yet?
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No. Are you?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer chuckles.]
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How far away are these guns?
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	There aren't any guns.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs her.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I lied.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You lied?
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It was the only way he'd let us go back.
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So why are you going back?
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Karma. Why are you going back, James?
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! Hey guys, wait up!
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley emerges from the brush.]
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell do you want?
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm coming with you guys.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Uh uh, no way. Not a chance.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Come on, I can help. They're my friends too, man. Look, Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help, please?
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	For God's sake, Hugo, look at you. You're just gonna get in the way. You want to get us killed? [To Juliet] Come on.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer leaves, and Juliet reluctantly follows, leaving Hurley abashed.]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Further away, Ben and Alex have stopped while Ben studies his map.]
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	If we head North, we should get to 'em before they reach the tower.
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Why did you let me come?
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me, Alex.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	You locked Karl in a cage. You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We better get going.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Ben. Why do you have to stop them? Why won't you just let them leave.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Because I can't, Alex.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They carry on.]
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the DHARMA mass grave, Locke opens his eyes. He moves his legs with his arms, and sees a gun on one of the skeletons. He drags himself to it barely, and checks it to see it has bullets in. He prepares to shoot himself in the head, amidst whispers.]
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	Don't, John.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[John looks suddenly to see Walt stood over the grave.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Put the gun down.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Walt!
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Now get up, John.
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	He shot me and I can't, move my legs.
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	You can move your legs. Now get out of the ditch, John.
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why?
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Because, you have work to do.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke smiles.]
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The team continue to trek as Jack approaches Kate.]
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You OK?
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I just, got a rock in my shoe.
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He didn't mean it, you know.
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, he didn't mean it.
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He didn't mean it, why'd he say it?
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He was trying to protect you. That's why I asked you not to come back for me.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He starts to go.]
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer? He'd never do it for you.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I love you.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks on, as does Kate after a moment's reflection.]
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack drives his car while listening to Nirvana and looking at the newspaper clipping. He stops, and dials on his phone.]
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICEMAIL	You have reached three one zero five five five zero...
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hangs up and exits his car, stepping right out into the road and almost getting run down. He enters a funeral parlor, where a closed casket is on display, and seats lined up with no-one there. The funeral director enters the room.]
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIRECTOR	Can I help you?
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry I er. Actually I came, er, is the funeral over?
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIRECTOR	There was no funeral, sir, only a viewing. [Pauses] Nobody showed up.
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nobody? You sure?
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIRECTOR	Just you. [Rather disinterestedly] My deepest condolences. Friend or family?
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Neither.
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIRECTOR	Would you like me to open it up?
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No... no.
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIRECTOR	Take your time.
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack goes over to the casket and places his hand on it, tears in his eyes. He gets a pack of pills from his pocket, and notices he only has one left.]
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Mutters] Damn it.
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He takes the pill, and leaves.]
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack catches up to Rousseau on their trek.]
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Danielle. How much further?
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	About an hour.
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The radio tower, when was the last time you were there?
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	The day I recorded the message. I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving the island.
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	There's no place for me back there. This is my home now.
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As they walk, they see Ben and Alex standing right ahead of them. Everyone stops, Jack steps forward]
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Jack. We need to talk.
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the Looking Glass, Mikhail exits the comms room.]
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRETA	What did Ben say?
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Can we kill him?
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Is it possible to turn this equipment off?
948	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	What?
950	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	The equipment that's jamming the Island, can you turn it off?
952	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRETA	Sure. Ben gave us the code.
954	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	You are the only ones who have it?
956	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Yeah. Why?
958	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	What would happen if this station were to be flooded?
960	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GRETA	Nothing. The casing for the equipment is waterproof, it'll keep going forever.
962	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	Then why do you need to be here?
964	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Because Ben told us to. We were following orders.
966	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	And you never asked why?
968	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	No. Because I trust him. And I trust Jacob. And the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing, everything that we're doing here falls apart.
970	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	[To Greta] She makes an excellent point.
972	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He shoots Greta, who falls into the water. Bonnie runs, and Mikhail shoots her in the back. He kicks her over.]
974	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	No, please.
976	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	I'm sorry, Bonnie, I too am following orders.
978	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond emerges]
980	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey!
982	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He shoots Mikhail with the speargun in the chest. Bonnie tries to grab his gun. Desmond gets it first and points it at her]
984	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, Des, no, don't! We need her.
986	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Ben stand opposite each other inland. Kate heads off to take the flank, as Jack goes to Ben and circles him.]
988	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[To Naomi] Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure...
990	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't talk to him! [To Ben] What do you want?
992	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone.
994	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	For what?
996	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jack, you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes.
998	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose and Sun exchange anxious looks. Kate arrives back to Jack.]
1000	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He alone?
1002	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	There's only two sets of tracks, his and hers.
1004	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Five minutes.
1006	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben nods, as he leads on taking Jack away, Jack grabs Ben's walkie.]
1008	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack picking up a prescription.]
1010	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHARMACIST	I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.
1012	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ah, that's a mistake. I, uh, I only refilled it twice, could you check again?
1014	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHARMACIST	I did check it again, Dr. Shephard, and that was the third refill so there's nothing I can do.
1016	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Fine. I've got another prescription right here.
1018	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Hey, I know you. You're the hero.
1020	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not a hero.
1022	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Yeah yeah, we saw it on TV. Hey lady, what's wrong with you? Just give this guy whatever he needs. Do you know what he did?
1024	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Here it is, here. Oxycodone.
1026	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHARMACIST	Dr. Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.
1028	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's not me, that's Dr. Christian Shephard, I'm Dr. Jack Shephard, he's my father.
1030	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHARMACIST	I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm this.
1032	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's out of town right now.
1034	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PHARMACIST	Well I'm sure somebody in the office-
1036	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack slams on the counter.]
1038	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't bother.
1040	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He leaves, knocking over a fixture as he goes.]
1042	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack follows Ben away from the main group.]
1044	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Have a seat.
1046	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack does so with Ben.]
1048	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Not so long ago, Jack. I made a decision, that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day. I'm telling you this because, history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now.
1050	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Let me guess, you've got us surrounded, and if I don't do what you say you're gonna, you're gonna kill all my people.
1052	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No Jack, you are.
1054	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack laughs.]
1056	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And how am I going to do that, Ben?
1058	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is.
1060	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She's not, huh?
1062	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	No, she's not.
1064	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then who is she?
1066	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys.
1068	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, I almost forgot, you're the, you're the good guys.
1070	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people.
1072	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not going anywhere.
1074	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both stand confrontationally.]
1076	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	May I have my walkie back?
1078	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
1080	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	There's something you need to hear. Please.
1082	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gives it him.]
1084	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Thank you. Tom, are you there?
1086	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Yeah, I'm here.
1088	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[To Jack] Your plan killed seven of my people, but the one's that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint.
1090	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack, don't give him anything!
1092	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sounds of a struggle can be heard over the walkie.]
1094	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Leave him alone!
1096	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	I said shut up!!
1098	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A thud signals Ryan hitting someone.]
1100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And what's to stop me from snapping your neck?
1102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Quickly] Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.
1104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Got it.
1106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben looks at his watch.]
1108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	I said don't move!!
1110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Bring me the phone, Jack.
1112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Don't negotiate with him-
1114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Gag him.
1116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No!
1118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Forty seconds.
1120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. I'm getting them all off the Island. ALL OF THEM!
1122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no-one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's 20 seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.
1124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
1126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.
1128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
1130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm not bluffing!
1132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I WON'T DO IT!!!
1134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Five. Four. Three...
1136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
1138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
1140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Three shots sound over the walkie talkie.]
1142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm so sorry, Jack.
1144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack attacks Ben, hitting him numerous times and causing his own knuckles to bleed. He grabs the walkie.]
1146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Tom. Are you there?
1148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Yeah, Jack, I hear you.
1150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm gonna make a call. And I'm gonna get 'em all rescued, every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you, and I'm gonna kill you.
1152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the Looking Glass, Charlie has been set free by Desmond.]
1154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's the code?
1156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Go away.
1158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Bonnie, let's just get this over with, OK? What's the code?
1160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	She's not gonna tell you, brother.
1162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah she's gonna tell me.
1164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What makes you say that?
1166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Because you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer. OK, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here. All right, let's be perfectly honest. A one-eyed maniac just killed your friend, he shot you in the back. It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it. Are you a sodding idiot? You have the opportunity to make Ben very very angry. Why would you not take that?
1168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Five, four, five...
1170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
1172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Eight, seven, sev-...
1174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is that the code?
1176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Five, five, four, three, seven, seven...
1178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Start again.
1180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Six, one.
1182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Stop, Bonnie. Start from the beginning, start again. Bonnie, Bonnie! Wake up, stop. Bonnie, start again. Start again.
1184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	"Good Vibrations."
1186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
1188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BONNIE	Beach Boys. "Good Vibrations." On the keypad, the numbers, they're notes. It was programmed by a musician.
1190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bonnie loses consciousness. Charlie and Desmond exchange looks.]
1192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inland, Jack drags a bloody Ben back to the main group, and throws him on the ground.]
1194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Tie him up. He's coming with us.
1196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks on and Kate chases after him. Alex approaches Ben, and Danielle approaches Alex.]
1198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	What?
1200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Sighs] Alex. This is your mother.
1202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They stare at each other, Rousseau holding back tears. She holds Alex's face in her hands.]
1204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	I'll help you tie him up.
1206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate catches up to Jack.]
1208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened? What'd he say?
1210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's not important right now. Just, get everything together-
1212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack. Your knuckles. Here.
1214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate cleans them for him.]
1216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened?
1218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He killed them. Bernard, Jin, Sayid, all three of them. He radioed the beach. And I let it happen. I had to let it happen. We can't tell Rose, or Sun, not yet. We gotta keep moving, I promised Sayid, that we would keep moving.
1220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?
1222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I want him to see it. I want him to experience the moment that we get off this Island, and I want him to know, that he failed. And then I'll kill him.
1224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, Ryan and Tom argue as they walk.]
1226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	It was an order, Tom, we had to follow it.
1228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, he's lost it! I mean look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damned sand, we should have killed them for real.
1230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid, Jin and Bernard are still tied up with a third Other pointing his gun at them. Further away, Juliet and Sawyer observe.]
1232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All they got left is three guys and four guns.
1234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.
1236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So we'll wait 'til night.
1238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	That isn't going to change the fact that we're unarmed, if you wanna kill yourself, fine, but before you go I can try-
1240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Shh! You hear that?
1242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They turn to see the DHARMA van drive right by them. Hurley drives it through a tent and straight toward Ryan and Tom. Tom dives out of the way while Ryan fires at Hurley. He misses, however, and Hurley ploughs right into him.]
1244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MALE OTHER	RYAN!
1246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley brakes and prepares to get out of the van. Sawyer pushes the car door back shut.]
1248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Woo!
1250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Stay in the bus, Hugo.
1252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs Ryan's gun off the ground, and jumps out round the front at the male Other. Sayid kicks him, knocking him down before he can fire at Sawyer. Sayid then wraps his legs round his neck, breaking it before Sawyer shoots. Jin, Bernard and Sawyer all look with surprise, as Sayid nods to Sawyer. Tom crawls to another gun on the ground, but Juliet grabs it and steps on his hand, causing him to cry out with pain.]
1254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Points the gun at him] Stay right there, Tom.
1256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	[Turns to Sawyer] OK. I give up.
1258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pauses, then shoots him in the chest, surprising Juliet]
1260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's for taking the kid off the raft.
1262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, it was over, he surrendered.
1264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I didn't believe him.
1266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Jack is in the hospital. Jack raids a medicine cabinet, and gets some oxycodone. He takes some, and pockets more. He then leaves, but knocks over files.]
1268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?
1270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack turns to see Hamill at the door.]
1272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I was just, uh, I just just checking the, uh, the Arland charts. Just wanted to, just wanted to see how the operation went.
1274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	I left three messages on your voicemail, you didn't get them?
1276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My phone's broken.
1278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	Let's go to my office, Jack.
1280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	For what?
1282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	We need to have a talk. Come on.
1284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know, I know that you're, you're new around here, so you don't know much about-
1286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	I know enough. But let's just walk down to my office-
1288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If you've got something to say to me, you can say it to me, right here.
1290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	[To a nurse] Will you excuse us, please?
1292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The nurse leaves.]
1294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	Mrs. Arlene, the woman you saved, woke up in recovery about two hours ago. She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex test and entirely lucid.
1296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's... that's great.
1298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	But then she described the series of events that caused her accident. She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw a man standing on top of the railing, about to jump off. She was distracted, lost control of her car. She ran into the median, rolled over and was hit by the van behind her. So the obvious question here, Jack, is how did you get to that flaming car so fast? What were you doing on that bridge?
1300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital? Do you know anything about me? Do you have any idea what I've been through?
1302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	How much have you had to drink today, Jack?
1304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	OK, I'll tell you what, you do this. You get my father down here, get him down here right now, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me! [Pause] Don't you look at me like that. Don't you, pity me.
1306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DR. HAMILL	I'm trying to help you.
1308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	YOU CAN'T HELP ME!
1310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone in the ward stares. Jack walks away.]
1312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack leads the group with Rousseau toward the tower. Ben's walkie which he carries suddenly springs to life.]
1314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach...
1316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone stops and listens.]
1318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley?
1320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack?
1322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are you, what's going on?
1324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude. I'm back at the beach.
1326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
1328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer. I, I saved them.
1330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They're OK, Juliet and-
1332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all-
1334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What, wait. Bernard and Jin and Sayid, they're with you?!
1336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, dude, I told you, I saved 'em all.
1338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone shouts with relief and hug, most notably Rose and Sun.]
1340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, stay where you are, we're almost up to the tower. You'll be safer there.
1342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I got ya, we'll stay put until you, like, phone home.
1344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone continues to cry happily as Claire steps forward.]
1346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Into the walkie] What about Charlie, did he make it back yet?
1348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.
1350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks out at an empty sea.]
1352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Des? There's diving gear in those racks, yeah?
1354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye. There's plenty.
1356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why don't you take care of that, I'll tap out "Good Vibrations."
1358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	All right, mate.
1360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, Des.
1362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye?
1364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You get any flashes?
1366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No, nothing.
1368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Meet you back here then.
1370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
1372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie heads to the communication room and enters the code by entering numbers corresponding to the notes to the song. When he finishes, the yellow light goes out, and an engine of some kind seems to start up.]
1374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So much for fate.
1376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As he leaves, a noise calls him back, a flat beep sound. A button is flashing, and Charlie reads the text under it.]
1378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Incoming transmission!
1380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He quickly presses it, and Penelope Widmore appears on the view-screen.]
1382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Hello?! Can you hear me?
1384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yes, yes I can hear you.
1386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Who is this? Who am I speaking to?
1388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Charlie er... Charlie Pace, I'm a survivor of Flight eight-one-five, Oceanic Flight eight-one-five.
1390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Er... where are you?
1392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're on an island, we're alive.
1394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	An island!! Well where, what's your location?
1396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I dunno. Who's this?
1398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	This is Penelope. Penelope Widmore. How did you get this frequency?
1400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Shouts] Desmond? Desmond!
1402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Did you just say Desmond?
1404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, he's here, he's with me.
1406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	[Smiles] Is he OK?
1408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	He's brilliant! Hey, are you on the boat?
1410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	What, what boat?
1412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Your boat, 80 miles off shore. Er... Naomi, parachutist.
1414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	But, I'm not on a boat, who, who's Naomi?
1416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond looks around the moon pool room, and notices Mikhail's body is missing. In the comms room, a tap at the window cause Charlie to turn. Mikhail is outside in the water, with a grenade in his hand.]
1418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Hello, hello is Desmond there? Desmond, can you hear me? Desmond?
1420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail pulls the cork. Charlie turns to see Desmond running toward the room, and he rushes to close the door. As he does so, Desmond sees the video screen.]
1422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENNY	Can you hear me?
1424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Penny!!! NO!
1426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie closes the door and locks it. Mikhail lets off the grenade and the window is destroyed. Water rushes into the comms room]
1428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Charlie!!!
1430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie turns to the water as Desmond hammers against the door with a fire extinguisher. Charlie stands still then suddenly rushes, grabbing a pen from his pocket and writing on his hand desperately. He then dives down to the door window between him and Desmond, pressing his hand on the glass with the words "Not Penny's boat". Desmond understands, and Charlie smiles. Charlie then breathes in, and he rushes backwards in the water. As he drowns, he gestures the cross on his chest.]
1432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Out in the jungle, Aaron begins to cry in Claire's arms.]
1434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Shhh. Hey Aaron, it's OK, sweetie.
1436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	What's the matter?
1438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I dunno, I think he's just a bit scared.
1440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Hard to blame him.
1442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi's phone beeps. She looks at it, and the light is beeping green.]
1444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What is it?
1446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	What's your boyfriend's name? The rock star who swam down to the station?
1448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Charlie, why?
1450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Charlie just got us rescued.
1452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi runs up the line of trekkers.]
1454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Jack!! Jack, he did it!! Your friend bloody well did it!
1456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
1458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	The green light, it's on. The jamming's stopped.
1460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Use it then.
1462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	All right.
1464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She dials.]
1466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	Four, four, two..
1468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FEMALE VOICE	[Speaks in French]
1470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	What's this?
1472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's Rousseau's message, it's still blocking the signal.
1474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	It doesn't matter. We're here.
1476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	[On phone] Iteration one, seven, five...
1478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group trek up a hill to see the radio tower dominating the sky. Inside the French message can be heard playing on loop. The recording is from a machine in the room by a speaker.]
1480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	I recorded this 16 years ago. [To Alex] Three days before you were born. I guess we don't need it anymore.
1482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She turns off the recording and removes the tape.]
1484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Naomi] All right, do it.
1486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi holds the phone.]
1488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I can't get a signal in here.
1490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all exit the room and go outside, as everyone watches, including Ben who has been tied to a tree.]
1492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I'm getting something!
1494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's gonna work! It's happening, we're gonna get off of this Island!
1496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We'll celebrate when we're home.
1498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jack! I know you think you're saving your people. But you need to stop this. It's a mistake.
1500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The mistake was listening to you.
1502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end.
1504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I've got it, I've got a signal!!!
1506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jack, please, you don't know what you're doing!!
1508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know exactly what I'm doing.
1510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi presses on the phone, and it says "CONNECTED". Naomi suddenly shakes, and spurts blood from her mouth. She falls down with a knife in her back and drops the phone. Behind her, Locke moves forward.]
1512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	JOHN!!!
1514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke pulls out the gun he found, and points it at Jack.]
1516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Step back, Jack.
1518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What did you do?
1520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What I had to. Now step back.
1522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack stays still as the phone tone signals that Naomi has made the call, and there just needs someone to answer it.]
1524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Stay away from the phone.
1526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack dives for it. Locke tries to destroy it, but his shot misses and Jack takes it.]
1528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you doing, John?
1530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't wanna shoot you.
1532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Do it, John! Shoot him! Do what you need to do-
1534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau knocks him unconscious with an elbow strike to the face. The phone continues to beep waiting for someone to pick up.]
1536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Please. Put the phone down.
1538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. You're done keeping me on this Island.
1540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke cocks the barrel.]
1542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I will kill you if I have to.
1544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then do it, John.
1546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
1548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke pauses, and then lowers the gun.]
1550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack. You're not supposed to do this.
1552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The phone is answered.]
1554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Minkowski. Hello?
1556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack puts it to his ear.]
1558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who is this?
1560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Who is this?
1562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My name is Jack Shephard. Are you, are you on the boat, the freighter?
1564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	How'd you get this channel?
1566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke can be seen leaving the area.]
1568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Naomi, Naomi told us about your search team. About the boat.
1570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Naomi. You found her? Where is she? Who are you?
1572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location?
1574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Hell yeah we can. Sit tight. We'll be right there.
1576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone shares grins and shrieks with happiness as Jack and Kate look at each other.]
1578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - In Jack's apartment. Maps scatter the table. The whole place is a mess, and Jack sits on the floor drinking alcohol, flicking his flip-phone. He dials a number, and puts it to his ear.]
1580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	Hello.
1582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hello? It's me. Whoa whoa, wait, don't, don't hang up, please. I know what you said, I just. I just need to see you, please? Yeah, yeah out at the airport. You know where. Thank you.
1584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack drives to the airport and parks. Another car approaches. Jack steps out and the car stops. Out of the darkness appears Kate Austen. It is revealed that the whole episode hasn't consisted of flashbacks, but rather, flash-forwards.]
1586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
1588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
1590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Saw you on the news. Still pulling people out of burning wreckage, huh?
1592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Old habits.
1594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You look terrible.
1596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Laughs] Thanks.
1598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why did you call me, Jack?
1600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hands her his newspaper clipping.]
1602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I was hoping that you'd heard. That maybe you'd go to the funeral.
1604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why would I go to the funeral?
1606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I've been flying a lot.
1608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
1610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, that golden pass that they gave us. I, I've been using it. Every Friday night I... fly from LA to Tokyo or, Singapore, Sydney. [Laughs] And then I, I get off and I, have a drink, and then I fly home.
1612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?
1614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I want it to crash, Kate. I don't care about anybody else on-board. Every little bump we hit or turbulence, I mean, I, I actually close my eyes, and I pray that I can get back.
1616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks near tears as does Jack.]
1618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	This is not gonna change.
1620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I'm sick of lying! We made a mistake.
1622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I have to go. He's gonna be wondering where I am-
1624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs her.]
1626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We were not supposed to leave.
1628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yes, we were.
1630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She releases herself.]
1632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Goodbye, Jack.
1634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She heads for her car.]
1636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We have to go back, Kate.
1638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She gets in her car and drives away.]
1640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We have to go back!
1642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A plane takes off over Jack's head.]
