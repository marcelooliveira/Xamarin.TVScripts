6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack enters his apartment and changes out of his hospital uniform. While changing, he notices a scar where he had his appendix removed, in a mirror. The phone rings.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey mom.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS SHEPARD	Have they found him yet?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I... I called a couple of hours ago, and they think the coffin was checked through Berlin.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS SHEPARD	How do you lose a body?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know mom, but there's nothing we can do except for wait for more information.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS SHEPARD	I don't want to wait Jack, how am I supposed to get anything done. I can't even find his will. Papers everywhere!
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look mom, I'll come over in a couple of hours an we'll find it together, okay?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS SHEPARD	Okay.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good. Now, mom, when did I have my appendix taken out?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS SHEPARD	You were seven, or eight, maybe. You collapsed at school. Your father wanted to do the procedure himself, but they wouldn't let him. You don't remember that?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I... I guess I do.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack notices the time.]
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, dammit. Mom, I gotta go.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MRS SHEPARD	Well don't forget to call--
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hangs up in a rush and grabs his keys and jacket on the way out.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pulls up in his truck at St Mary's Academy. He approaches the school steps and sees David, who walks towards him.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. Sorry I'm late. Thought I had enough time to go home and change after work.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Don't worry about it.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry David, okay.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[slightly irritated] Okay, Dad.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They continue walking away together.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At the Temple, Jack is looking at his reflection in a body of water in the grounds. Dogen approaches him.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	I was afraid you'd left.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is leaving an option?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	Everything is an option. But I would have to stop you.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well...I appreciate your honesty.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	Your friends - Ford and Austen and Kwon - they are not coming back, are they?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, probably not.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	I appreciate your honesty. [Jack nods. Slight smile from Dogen]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In another part of the temple grounds, Miles and Hurley are playing Tic-Tac-Toe by placing leaves in a grid of sticks on the ground.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Tie again, Dude.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Shocker. [pause] That's it for me.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hungry?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Are you?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I could eat.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the Temple spring room, Hurley walks past and asks notices a man crouched with his back to him on the pool steps.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey man, you know if there's like a kitchen in this place?
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	[Indicating with thumb] It's all the way down the hallway, Hugo.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley recognises the voice as Jacob, who turns to show his face.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, what are you doing here ?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob approaches him.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	I'm here because I need you.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	For what?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	You should probably get a pen, you're going to have to write a few things down.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What kind of things?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Someone's coming to the island. I need you to help them find it.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - David enters his room, followed by Jack. David is wearing earphones.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hooked up the cable in here, so you can watch the Red Sox if you want.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Thanks.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack picks up a book - "The Annotated Alice" by Lewis Carroll.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You reading this?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Yeah.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I used to read this to you when you were little. You always wanted to hear about Kitty and Snowdrop, they were Alice's...
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is interrupted mid-sentence by David leaving the room. Jack follows him out to the kitchen.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. Hey! David. [Gestures for David to take off his headphones. David does.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you listening to?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You haven't heard of them.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm just trying to have a conversation with you David.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Why? We see each other like once a month. Can't we just... get through it.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack's mobile phone rings. He answers.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah mom?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Where are you? I thought you were coming over?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sorry. I'm heading out right now. I'll be right there. [hangs up]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I have to go over to your grandmother's house, you wanna come?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	No thanks.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All right well, I'll be back in about an hour, then we'll eat, OK?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Great.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack sitting on a large stone in the Temple courtyard. Sayid approaches him.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sayid.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why are they all staring at me? [camera shows a few unknown Others looking their way]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just ignore them.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Look, you told me these people think I have an infection, that they wanted to give me some mysterious pill that you instructed me not to take. And then you disappeared. What are you hiding from me?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[thinking for a moment] The pill was poison. They wanted me to kill you. Whatever it is they think happened to you Sayid, they say it happened to someone else too.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at him silently.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the jungle, Claire walks rapidly down a jungle path. She is in dirty clothes and carrying a rifle. She approaches Jin who is lying on the ground with his leg caught in a gin trap.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Claire!
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I'm gonna get you out of there.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She uses a rod to release the trap]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	How long have you been out here?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Since you all left. How long ago was that?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Three years.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I can get you somewhere safe. Come on - think you can walk?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I don't know.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He tries and falls down after one step.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cut to a Temple corridor. Hurley is reading instructions written on his arm and seems to be looking for something on the stone walls.]
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	What are you doing?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nothing. I'm just you know...looking...because I'm a fan of ...temples and like history...Indiana Jones stuff.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	You shouldn't be here. Go back to the courtyard.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob appears, visible only to Hurley.]
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Tell him you can do what you want. Tell him you're a candidate.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm a candidate and I can do what I want.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	Who told you that? [Hurley exchanges silent looks with Jacob.]
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Doesn't matter. Why don't you go back to the courtyard ?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	[Speaks Japanese] Ore ga omae wo mamoraneba narannowa,un ga yokattana [Ã¤Â¿ÂºÃ£ÂÅ’Ã£ÂÅ Ã¥â€°ÂÃ£â€šâ€™Ã¥Â®Ë†Ã£â€šâ€°Ã£ÂÂ­Ã£ÂÂ°Ã£ÂÂªÃ£â€šâ€°Ã£â€šâ€œÃ£ÂÂ®Ã£ÂÂ¯Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ©Ââ€¹Ã£ÂÅ’Ã¨â€°Â¯Ã£Ââ€¹Ã£ÂÂ£Ã£ÂÅ¸Ã£ÂÂª-¢You're lucky that I have to protect you.] Denakereba sonokubi wo haneteta [Ã£ÂÂ§Ã£ÂÂªÃ£Ââ€˜Ã£â€šÅ’Ã£ÂÂ°Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ®Ã©Â¦â€“Ã£â€šâ€™Ã¨Â·Â³Ã£ÂÂ­Ã£ÂÂ¦Ã£ÂÅ¸-¢Otherwise I'd have cut your head off.]
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[turns and walks away.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What'd he say?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	You don't want to know. What are you doing here Hugo?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Going through the secret passageway like you told me.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	I told you to bring Jack with you.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You ever tried to get Jack to do something? It's like impossible. I can just go myself.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	You have to bring him with you Hugo.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	OK it's bad enough you already made me write down way too much stuff, and I just lied to a Samurai. Look, if you've any idea of how to get Jack to go on your little adventure, I'm listening dude.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob smiles at him.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is sitting on a bench in the courtyard. Hurley approaches him.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Be cool man. Act natural.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He sits beside Jack.]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, keep your voice down. I'm gonna get up and go. Wait ten seconds and then follow me.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Follow you where?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I found a secret tunnel that leads out to the jungle.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You found a secret tunnel?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, Jacob told me about it. Said you and me have to go.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not going anywhere, Hurley.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I told him you'd say that, so he told me to tell you "You have what it takes."
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets to his feet, somewhat agitated.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What'd you just say?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He said you have what it takes, he said you'd know what that meant.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is he?
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jacob. Where is he?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He's kind of dead. Turns up whenever he wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi. But...if you wanna talk to him, he's where we're going, dude.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well then let's go see Jacob.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin lying on his back in Claire's tent. He looks around, sits up and groans, clutching his leg.]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Claire?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He gets up and looks around the tent, seeing, among other things, explosives. He picks up an oar and uses it as a walking stick. He sees a crib and goes over to it to find it contains a skull.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[from outside] Get in there!
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin lies back down. Claire enters, pushing Justin in front of her, holding a rifle to his back.]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[to Jin] So, look what I found! One of the men who tried to kill you! He was just pretending to be dead but he wasn't. Now we get to talk to him!
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire hits Justin in the back of the knee with the rifle. He collapses, groaning.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	You wanna talk to me about what?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[begins to tie him up] About where you're hiding my son.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She finishes tying Justin up and walks towards Jin.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[to Jin] We'd better get that cleaned up. If there's one thing that'll kill you around here it's infection.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[sighs] I'll be right back, don't move, okay? [She turns to leave]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Claire?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She turns to look at him.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Have you been out here all this time...by yourself?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, no, no, I'm not by myself.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She leaves. Justin groans repeatedly.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	Look, we've gotta get out of here now.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He looks at Claire outside; Jin follows his gaze then looks back at him.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	It's okay. I know her.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	No. I know her. Do you have any idea what she's gonna do to us...if we don't get outta here now?! She's gonna kill us both!
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cut to the jungle. Jack and Hurley walking along by a river. Hurley looks around.]
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Which way?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[looks at his arm, then points] It's this way.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They continue walking. Jack sees a rucksack on a nearby rock and looks around to see Kate sitting by the river. She turns around and pulls a gun on him. Jack puts his hands up.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Whoa! Hey, it's me!
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[laughs] Jack! [she gets up and comes towards him] I almost shot you!
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughs] I noticed! What are you doing out here? Where...where's Jin and Sawyer?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jin went back to the Temple, and... Sawyer's on his own.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, Kate. There's a secret door to get back into the Temple on the north wall by the big tree...
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I'm not going back to the Temple. [she looks at Jack] I'm going to find Claire.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate...
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm going back to the beach camp. She might still be there, Jack.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, she's not at the beach... The people at the Temple said that something happened to her.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do they know where she is?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know, they didn't say.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[looks shocked] I have to...I have to find her.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate...wait...wait! Come with us and then we'll all go back to the Temple together.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Jack] Dude! [lowers voice] Jacob said just you and me...she's kinda not invited.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'm inviting her.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack, it's okay. Just go. [Jack approaches her] It's alright. I hope you find what you're looking for. [She turns and leaves. Focus on Jack watching her].
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - A car drives into the yard of a mansion. Cut to inside the house, Jack and his mother are searching through papers.]
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	We're never going to find it.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Take it easy, Mom. It's somewhere in here, and we'll find it.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	It's like a needle in a damned haystack. Why your father wouldn't just give his will to his lawyer is beyond me.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Stands, goes over to a box and picks it up.] Well, why would he make it easy on us now?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He sits back down. Mrs. Shephard opens a decanter of an alcoholic-looking drink in front of a bottle of McCutcheon's whisky.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	You want a drink? [she pours some]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh...no, no, no thanks.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Good for you.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks up at her and smiles, then goes back to sorting papers.]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	How's David holding up?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[concerned] What?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	He was really upset at the funeral.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He was?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	He didn't tell you?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No...no, he didn't. [pause, laughs mirthlessly under his breath] Communication is not one of his strong suits.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Well, it runs in the family. When you were David's age your father was lucky if he could get more than one word out of you at a time.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's because I was terrified of him, Mom.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	How do you know David isn't terrified of you?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[incredulous] Why would he be?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	I don't know, Jack. Maybe you should ask him.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She pulls out a paper from a bookshelf.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Found it. Last will and testament.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She sits down, dons glasses and begins to read it. She frowns.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Jack?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARGO	Did your father ever mention a Claire Littleton?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack doesn't respond.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Claire is outside of her hut. She lights a fire and sterilizes some medical instruments. She then starts to sharpen an axe.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	[to Jin] Psst! Hey! Untie me before she comes back in!
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Why would I do that?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	Are you not listening to me? She's gonna kill us both! Loosen my ropes, and when she comes back in, I'll snap her neck.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire reenters.]
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[to Jin] So, I'm...really sorry you got stuck in my trap. Gonna get you all cleaned up, now, okay?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She pours water on Jin's leg and begins to dress it. Jin winces.]
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	It's alright, you're doing good. Well. at least you don't have to stitch yourself up. [Jin is breathing heavily]. I had to do that once. They shot me right here [she points to her left leg].
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	You've been living here since we left? [he groans]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Not always here. I had to, um, move around quite a lot. To hide from them.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She gives Justin a dirty look.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Lucky I'm still alive.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	What are you going to do with him?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	He's gonna tell me where they've got my baby. Where they...where they've got Aaron.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	We don't have your kid!
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You're lying, okay, I know you have him.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Justin begins to talk over her.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	You're crazy! We never took your...
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Shut up.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Claire, how do you know they took him? How can you be so sure?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	How can I be so sure? Well, first my father told me, and then my friend told me, so I'm pretty damn sure.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Your friend? Who's your friend?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Tone of voice indicates this is self-explanatory] My friend. [looks up at Jin] You're still my friend, aren't you, Jin?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Yes, yes, of course.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Good. I'm glad. [She finishes fixing Jin's leg] All done. Good as new.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin breathes heavily. Claire gets up and retrieves an axe from beside the tent opening.]
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Okay. So. [to Justin] Now it's your turn.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jack are walking through the jungle.]
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry, dude.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	For what?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, what happened back there. Wrecking your game with Kate.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't worry about it. There's nothing left to wreck.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah? What happened to you guys? I thought you were gonna get married and have like a dozen kids.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Guess I wasn't cut out for it.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Really? I think you'd make a great dad.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'd make a terrible dad.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack finds an object on the floor. He picks it up and examines it.]
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What is that?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Asthma inhaler.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, it's Shannon's.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Jack looks at him, then around] We're at the caves.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[looks around also] The caves we used to live in?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the caves, Hurley inspects the Adam and Eve skeletons.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I totally forgot these were in here, man.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks around the cave.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait a sec. What if we time-travelled again? To, like, dinosaur times? And then we died and then we got buried here? [pause] What if these skeletons are us?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at an object. Hurley follows his gaze.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's that?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did I tell you how I found this place?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You were looking for water, right?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. I was chasing the ghost of my dead father. [laughs] He led me here. [points at the object] That was his coffin. Before I smashed it to pieces.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why'd you do that?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because he wasn't in it.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - We see, from inside an apartment, Jack opening the door, carrying a pizza.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	David? I got us pizza!
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cut to another door opening. Jack looks into a room.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, dinner's...
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[There is nobody in the room. It's a bedroom.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Later, Jack sits at a table. It's dark outside. He picks up a mobile and dials a number.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[on answering machine] This is David. Leave a message. [phone beeps]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	David, i-it's me again. Listen...uh....if I did something to upset you I am really, really sorry. [scene cuts to a car driving up to a suburban house, Jack's voiceover is heard, still leaving the message] I'm gonna drive over to your mother's house, I know that she's out of town, so if you are there, just...just don't go anywhere, okay? [We see that the car driver is Jack. He pulls up outside the house] What...whatever I did, I'm sorry.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets out of the car, walks up to the house and knocks on the front door. No answer. He takes the key from its hiding place and enters.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	David?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[No response. Jack enters David's room, and sees some sheet music for Chopin's "Fantasie Impromptu" with handwritten performance notes. He smiles at photos of himself and David pinned to the mirror. He checks David's messages.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE	"Ahhh yes this message is for David Shepard. Hi David this is Dr. Summerland from the Williams Conservatory, just calling to confirm you slot next Friday the 24th at 7 pm. We look forward to seeing you, and good luck." [Message ends. Next message]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE	[Jack's voice] Hey David, it's dad. I'm uh..., I'm in Sydney, Australia. Something...something happened...and I... I just needed to hear your voice. Ummm...I guess I'll try again later. I love you.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley and Jack walking down a jungle trail.]
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This is cool, dude. Very old school.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, you and me trekking through the jungle, on our way to do something that we don't quite understand. Good times. You mind if I ask you something?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sure.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why'd you come back, you know, to the island?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why'd you come back?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Back in L.A., Jacob hopped into the back of my cab, and told me I was supposed to, so I came.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head and laughs dismissively.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What? If you have a good reason for coming back, let's hear it man.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I came back here because I was broken. And I was stupid enough to think this place could fix me.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, I'm sorry.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How much further we got, Hurley?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not far. It's not far at all.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They arrive at an old stone lighthouse.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's right there. It's a lighthouse.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't understand. How is it that we've never seen it before?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Guess we weren't lookin for it.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cut to Claire interrogating Justin in her hut.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Tell me where my son is.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	I don't know where your son is.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Stop covering for them. They're not going to help you anymore. All you gotta do is just tell me the truth.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	I am telling you the truth. We don't have your kid. We never had your kid.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Stop lying to me! Your people took me to the temple and tortured me.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	No, we captured you because you were out here in the jungle picking our people off.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire swings axe to strike him, pausing when Jin interrupts.]
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Claire wait! Hold on.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hold on? Jin, they stuck me with needles. They branded me. [she shows scar on her shoulder] And if I hadn't been able to escape from the temple, they would have killed me.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	No, you're not remembering things right.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Look shut up, okay? You've got one more chance. One more chance - just tell me where my son is.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	I don't know where your damn kid is.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire swings the axe to strike him. Jin interrupts again.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Kate! Kate took him! Kate took Aaron. She took him with her when she left the island.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What do you mean she took him?
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	He's been with her, with Kate, for the past three years. Aaron is three.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JUSTIN	He's telling you the truth. We had nothing to do with this. So if you just untie me, I'll leave, and I promise I will never tell anyone I ever even saw you. Just untie me.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire swings and buries the axe in his chest, apparently fatally. She walks out of the hut.]
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jack are approaching the lighthouse.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Pretty cool, huh?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jacob's in here?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I guess so. First we gotta go upstairs and turn this thing on. [He tries the door, it doesn't open.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Does it say anything on your arm about the door being jammed?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack kicks the door in.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	After you. [They enter.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack is entering the Williams Conservatory as David's piano recital is in progress. Jack seems fascinated and amazed by the performance.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	UNKNOWN BOY [likely Dogen's son]	Is that your son?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	UNKNOWN BOY	He's really good.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Dogen is seen farewelling the boy, then speaks as Jack passes him.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	Itsumo doori yareba daijoubu da [Ã£Ââ€žÃ£ÂÂ¤Ã£â€šâ€šÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã£â€šÅ Ã£â€šâ€žÃ£â€šÅ’Ã£ÂÂ°Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¤Â¸Ë†Ã¥Â¤Â«Ã£ÂÂ ] Yoshi itte koi! [Ã£â€šË†Ã£Ââ€”Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã£ÂÂ£Ã£ÂÂ¦Ã£Ââ€œÃ£Ââ€žÃ¯Â¼Â-¢Okay,It's time to go!]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	They are too young to have this kind of pressure, aren't they?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes. Yes they are.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOGEN	It's hard to watch and be unable to help. Your son has a gift. How long has he been playing?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I... I don't know.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack leaves.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley and Jack have reached the top of the lighthouse, and see the large brass wheel mechanism with mirrors mounted on top.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Whoa! Dude this is cool. Must've built this to help ships get here and stuff. I guess they used the mirror because electricity hadn't been invented yet.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Jacob?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ahh he's not here yet. Lets get started. [reads instructions on his arm. Starts pulling chain which rotates the mirrors around the wheel.] Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sees a brief image in the mirror of a traditional asian style building. He looks behind him but sees nothing but ocean. He sees then a western style wooden building.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Stop!
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley stops.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you see that?
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did I see what?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The mirror. I saw something in the mirror.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's just ocean dude.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley continues to turn the wheel. Jack sees names marked at numbered locations around the wheel.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	These are our names. [He sees "Shephard" at location 23.] Turn it to 23 degrees.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I...I don't think Jacob wants
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack interrupts him by grabbing the chain and turning it until wheel reaches 23 degrees. An image appears of the house seen earlier in this episode where he met his mother.]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What. What is that?
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's my house. It's the house I grew up in.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh. That's weird.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Haven't lived in that house since I was a kid. He's been watching. The whole time. All of us. He's been watching us. Hurley, where's Jacob?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You said that he'd be here.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well I was just...kind of...assuming.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, I wanna know why he was watching me. I wanna know. So you're going to ask him right now.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It doesn't work like that, I told you. He just kind of shows up whenever he feels like it.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head angrily, goes and grabs a telescope off its stand, and returns to Hurley.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why was he watching?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why is my name written down on this thing?
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He didn't tell me.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What does he want from me?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Aren't we supposed--
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack interrupts him, shouting.]
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What does he want from me?!
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY [shouting]	I don't know, Jack!
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack uses the telscope to smash all the mirrors on the mechanism. He drops the telescope and walks away.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - David prepares to leave the Williams Conservatory grounds on his bicycle. Jack approaches.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You were great in there.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You...saw me? [Jack nods] I missed a couple of notes.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sounded perfect from where I was standing. [pause] David you scared the hell outta me.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You were at grandmas. I thought I could get back to your place before I got home.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I didn't know you were still playing.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I made mom promise not to tell you.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why?
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	It was always such a big deal to you. You used to sit and watch me practice. You were so...into it. I didn't tell you I was coming here because...I didn't want you to see me fail.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know when I was your age, my father didn't want to see me fail either. He used to say to me that...he said that I didn't have what it takes. I spent my whole life carrying that around with me. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I will always love you, no matter what you do. In my eyes you can never fail. I just wanna be a part of your life.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[long pause] Okay.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I've got some pizza back at the house. You hungry?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Sure.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good. Let's go home.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They head for Jack's car together.]
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack is sitting on a cliff some distance away, staring at the ocean. Jacob appears to Hurley.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	How'd it go?
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Where were you, man?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Doesn't matter, he wouldn't have been able to see me anyway.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, well if you'd told me that and I'd like, explained everything, then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out and smashed your mirror into a billion pieces. Thanks for the seven years of bad luck, by the way.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	You've got ink on your forehead.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I have ink on my forehead? That's all you have to say? Jack broke your lighthouse, dude. Mission un-accomplished. Whoever you said we need to help get to the island is totally screwed.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	[unconcerned] Well I'm sure they'll find some other way.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So...everything you wanted me to do didn't get done, and you don't even care?
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jacob looks over towards Jack, Hurley does the same.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Wait a minute. Did you want Jack to see what was in that mirror? [A slightly smug smile from Jacob.] Why?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	It was the only way for him to understand how important he is.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That was your plan? I think it backfired, man.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Jack is here because he has to do something. He can't be told what that is. He's got to find it himself. Sometimes you can just...hop in the back of someone's cab and tell them what they're supposed to do. Other times...you have to let them look out at the ocean for a while.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well next time how about you tell me everything up front. I'm not big on secret plans OK.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo. I had to get you and Jack as far away from that Temple as I possibly could.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What? Why?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	Because someone's coming there. Someone bad.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, we gotta warn them!
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACOB	You can't warn them Hugo. I'm sorry, it's too late.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In Claire's hut, Jin is looking at Justin's dead body. Claire enters.]
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Look, if I didn't kill him, he would've killed me. Glad you didn't untie him.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Claire, please, whatever you're thinking.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Why'd you say that Kate was raising Aaron?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She offers him a drink of water.]
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[drinks] I was lying.
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Why?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Because I wanted to save his life. But you were right. The others have your baby. Aaron is at the temple, I know because I saw him there. But you'll need me to get to him.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire looks at Jin for a moment.]
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	How do we get in?
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	There's a secret way. No-one will see us.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thank you Jin, thank you. And I'm so glad to know you were lying because...if what you said was the truth, if Kate was raising Aaron...I'd kill her.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke suddenly enters the hut.]
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Am I interrupting?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	John?
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	That's not John. This is my friend.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Malevolent smile from Locke. Claire smiles at Jin.]
