10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid sitting on a beach, looking at his photos. He looks at the writing on the back of the photo. He looks across the beach and notices something metal sticking out of the sand. Shot of cable in the sand with a piece of the interior exposed. Sayid carefully digs it up. Pan left to the cable going into the ocean, presumably. Shot of Sayid using the cable as a guide going toward the jungle.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of bandage being ripped off of Sawyer's arm, at Sawyer's tent.]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ow, easy, Jackass.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You want it easy, quit moaning. I've got to change these bandages.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, try not taking my skin off with them. How'd I score the house call, Dr. Quinn. Trying to ease your conscience?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My conscience is fine, thanks.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Of course, what do you have to feel guilty about? I mean, you just let that damn Arab torture me -- stood by and watched. You figure you patch me up -- buy you a ticket into heaven? Only reason you're here...
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm here because no one else wants anything to do with you.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She does.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Change your own bandages.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate on the beach looking worried. Jack approaches.]
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Looking for someone, or just admiring the view?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's been two days since Sayid took off on his own. I keep looking up, thinking I'm going to see him coming back.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He'll come back when he's found what he's looking for -- the French transmission.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He isn't looking for anything. He left because of what happened -- for what he did.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It was an accident.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, accidents happen when you torture people, Jack.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate. He can take care of himself.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of jungle floor pans up to reveal Sayid walking toward the camera. We see the jungle floor with the cable running along it. Sayid notices a tripwire and carefully steps over it. We see a rope moving through the jungle floor and Sayid's ankles are caught in a trap.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid hanging upside down, praying. He hears something.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Hello? Hello?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of knife used to cut Sayid down. He falls, and sees someone wearing army green cargo pants, carrying the knife coming toward him before he loses consciousness.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack doctoring a redshirt. Voices of people arguing (you, get him out of there, he's drinking our water)].
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's going on out there?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, you know, the usual -- people yelling at each other over nothing.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	Doc, what do you think this is, this, this, this, uh, rash. It's bad, right, like some kind of a tropical disease?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's hives.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	What's that? Is that like poison ivy?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's a common rash, Sullivan. It's brought on by heat and stress.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	Okay.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just try to relax; it'll clear up.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	Right.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Try to keep your mind off it.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	Okay, [to Sun who has a poultice] What is that? Is it like aloe? Isn't that for sunburn, or something?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Try to keep your mind off it? What else has that guy got to do but stress?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I've got enough on my plate without having to treat hypochondriacs.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, but that's like my point, man. We're all fried. I'm mean, have you taken a look at everybody out there? Everybody's way tense. Dude, I'm just saying, it'd be sweet if we could have, I don't know, something to do.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're surviving here Hurley, and that's what my main concern is, keeping us alive. Things could be worse.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of an "interrogation" light. We hear a bunch of voices/languages asking "Where is Alex?" (The voice may just be one voice slowing, morphing into Rousseau's voice as Sayid is coming to. It's like the voice is becoming clearer through a fog). Sayid is tied to a metal bed frame.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What? Who are you?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Where is Alex?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know what you're talking about.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A figure runs across the frame and does something that electrocutes Sayid.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Where is Alex?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Please listen...
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Where is Alex?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know any Alex.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid gets electrocuted again.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Stop!
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot of a prisoner being beaten by Sayid in Iraq.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PRISONER	Stop.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Arabic [Ã˜ÂªÃ˜Â±Ã™Å Ã˜Â¯Ã™â€ Ã™Å  Ã˜Â£Ã™â€  Ã˜Â£Ã˜ÂªÃ™Ë†Ã™â€šÃ™ÂÃ˜Å’ Ã™ÂÃ˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â­Ã˜Å¸ Ã˜Â¥Ã˜Â°Ã˜Â§ Ã˜Â£Ã˜Â¬Ã˜Â¨ Ã˜Â¹Ã™â€  Ã˜Â£Ã˜Â³Ã˜Â¦Ã™â€žÃ˜ÂªÃ™Å  Ã™â€žÃ˜Â£Ã™â€ Ã™â€ Ã™Å  Ã™Å Ã™â€¦Ã™Æ’Ã™â€ Ã™â€ Ã™Å  Ã™ÂÃ˜Â¹Ã™â€ž Ã™â€¡Ã˜Â°Ã˜Â§ Ã™Æ’Ã™â€ž Ã™Å Ã™Ë†Ã™â€¦.

Then start answering my questions because I can do this all day. I assure you we already know the truth. But I want you to admit it.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[In English] And all the pain will stop. Your Shiite friends have already implicated you in the bombing. [shouting] You planted the device in the Baathist headquarters, didn't you? You killed two soldiers. [lowered voice] Confess it. Confess it, and perhaps it will only cost you your hands instead of your life.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The prisoner throws up.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid and his boss/friend, Omar, walking in military type surroundings.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He doesn't know anything. Your sources were wrong.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	Perhaps. But that's really not the point, is it? You handled yourself very well in there.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Did I?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	I'll put in for your reassignment to Intelligence Division, if you wish it.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes, sir, very much so.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	Good, now stop calling me sir when it's just the two of us.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're my superior officer, Omar -- for now.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	And I'll enjoy it while it lasts.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a woman being brought in for interrogation. Sayid watches her.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	That reminds me, Sayid. In addition to your increased responsibility... Communications officer... [the dialogue volume fades as the woman walks by.]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Hurley sitting asleep on a log. A bag is dropped at his feet, waking him up.]
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Hi
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yo. What's this?
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They were in the jungle. They must have fallen from the plane.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What are you guys doing out in the jungle at night?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Best time to hunt.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Ethan here has some experience -- spotted some tracks, looked like they might be rabbit or some other rodent.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Rodent, yum.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Figured people are starting to get tired of eating boar meat.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You got that right. Alright, well, I'll take a look at these [indicated the suitcases], and see if there's anything useful.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ETHAN	Okay.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Hurley digging through luggage and finding red Hawaiian shirt. We see Locke sheath his knife, and Walt wakes up.]
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Mr. Locke, are you going back out to hunt?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	For a bit.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Can I go with you? I mean, I just want to learn how to do what you do-
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[waking up] Walt!
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I was just. I was talking to Mr. Locke and...
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I know what you're doing. It's not going to happen, man. Get back to bed.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[opening a bag] Whoa, dude. [He smiles.]
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid being electrocuted.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Please just listen to me! I keep telling you I don't know who Alex is! I'm a survivor of a plane crash. I found a wire on the beach, I followed it. I thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up on our receiver. A recording, a mayday, with a French woman repeating on a loop for 16 years.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Si quelqu'un m'entend, je vous en prie, venez Ãƒ notre aide... Il les a tuÃƒÂ©s. Il les a tous tuÃƒÂ©s... [Translation - If anybody hears me, please, come to our rescue... It (or-He-) killed them. It (or -He-) killed them ALL] [coming out of the shadows] 16 years. Has it really been that long?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You just happened to hear my distress call? I know what you are. [She knocks him out with the butt of a rifle.]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Rousseau's place, she's going through Sayid's backpack. There's a big book in it. Sayid is looking around and sees a jacket with the name Rousseau on it.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Rousseau.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	How do you know my name?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I read it. There, on the jacket.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau has Sayid's photos from his pack.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What is this place? Those batteries -- they wouldn't be able to produce enough power to transmit your distress call all these years.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	It broadcasts from somewhere else. But they control it now.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	They?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You. And the others like you.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know who you think I am. I've already told you I'm not...
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Sayid?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How do you know my name?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	My name was on a jacket, your's is on the envelope you carry. Who is she? The woman in the photographs.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nadia. Her name is Nadia.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Sayid and Omar in Iraq.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	We cannot tie Noor Abed-Jazeem directly to the bombing, but we know where her sympathies lie. She's a known associate of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You think she knows who orchestrated the bombing?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	That, my friend, is exactly what you will find out.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid in a room with the woman he had watched being escorted into the building in the previous flashback.]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Noor Abed-Jazeem, I'm going to ask you some questions. If you refuse to cooperate I'm going to hurt you. Do you understand?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid. You of all people should know that.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid is startled.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	What? You don't remember me? Am I so different from the little girl in the school yard who used to push you in the mud?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nadia?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	And your mother would tell my mother, "why must you pick on little Sayid." And I'd answer, because he ignores me.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You had enough attention with your family's wealth and your charm.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Such things matter little to children. But then you always were older than your years, weren't you, Sayid?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Not old enough to understand that being pushed in the mud was a sign of affection. Now you're a traitor to your country. Tell me what you know about the bombing in Najaf. Tell me, or I swear I will hurt you.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Oh, I know Sayid. This is not my first interrogation by the Republican Guard. This is where they burned me with acid -- they pierced my hands with a drill. Would you like to see the soles of my feet? Where they flayed the skin off? These are the handiworks of your friends. The people you swear allegiance to.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If you were innocent, I am sorry. But this bombing is a different matter, Nadia.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Go on, Sayid, do your work. I'm not going to tell you anything.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then I'm going to hurt you.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	I know.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of a old bullet wound on Sayid's leg back at Danielle's place.]
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You have a bullet wound.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I was a soldier.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You were. And are you still?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That was a long time ago.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Tell me more about her, the woman -- Nadia.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Alex. Who is he?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael with a sketch book.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I'm bored. Can I take Vincent to the beach?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'll take you later, man. I'm in the middle of something.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	But there's nothing to do around here.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Well, you've got to figure out stuff to do. You know what I'm saying? You've got to find a way to entertain yourself.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley looking for something.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[rummaging suitcases in search for something, speaking to himself] Come on. Come on. I know I saw it. [He finds what he was looking for.] Yes.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, uh...
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hold on, man. I'm busy.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley sees Michael holding a long stick.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Michael] Dude, can I borrow this?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[takes the stick] Thanks, man.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, what are you doing?
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley just laughs.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Danielle at her place.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	So, you heard my transmission -- came looking for me, for answers?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I didn't know you were alive.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Still lying.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm not lying.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Lies!
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nothing...
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Like this plane crash which you survived. You claim there were others?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	More than 40, yes.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Then why are you alone?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I left them.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Why?
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	There was -- I did something, something I'm ashamed of.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	But Nadia, you left her, too?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	She wasn't on the plane. She's dead -- because of me.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	[putting her hand on his face] I'm so sorry. I want to show you something.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael's sketch book.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	See, this junction here -- re-route some of the spring's water flow into a couple of suspended basins, pop in some hose, you got showers. This way you keep the drinking water separate.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This is -- you drew this?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I was an artist in a previous life.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I thought you were in construction.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I am. I mean, I was -- long story.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, Jack. Hurley's all worked up about something, said we should come see it.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of plateau on mountain.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Welcome, to the first, and hopefully last, Island Open.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's two holes for now, 3 par, and no waiting.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, you built a golf course?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	All the stuff we've got to deal with, man -- this is what you've been wasting your time on?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dudes, listen. Our lives suck. Everyone's nerves are stretched to the max. I mean, we're lost on an Island, running from boars and monsters -- freakin' polar bears!
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Polar bears?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You didn't hear about the polar bear?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, all I'm saying is, if we're stuck here, then just surviving's not going to cut it. We need some kind of relief, you know. We need some way that we can, you know, have fun. That's right, fun. Or else we're just going to go crazy waiting for the next bad thing to happen.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Michael look at each other, bemused.]
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at Danielle's we see her music box.]
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	It's a music box, but it's broken. It has been for a long time. It was a gift from my love for our anniversary.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You mean Alex?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Robert. This was such a comfort to me in the first few years here.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I could fix it for you. I could take a look at it, if you freed my hands. [Danielle gets up quickly.] I'm very good with mechanical things. I need my hands.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle gets a syringe, scrapes it with sandpaper, and fills it with some medication.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	What is written on the back of your photograph?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you doing?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Did she write it? Or did you? Perhaps you don't want to tell me because it causes too much pain.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Rousseau, you don't need to do that.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Danielle giving him the injection.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael and Jack, close up on their faces.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	This is a problem, man.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I mean, I know what I'd do, but it's got to be your call.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, give me a seven iron.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You got it.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Hurley and Charlie who are taunting him] Hey, heads up over there!
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No chance, you won't get anywhere near us!
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	[off camera, interrupting Jack's shot] Hey, Doc? There you are. Somebody said you went this way. Listen, that rash of mine, it's starting to spread. It's like the size of a grape. What are you guys doing? Are you playing golf?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	Can I play?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid unconscious, chained to chair. He suddenly wakes up.]
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Sorry about the sedative. It was the only safe way for me to move you. You offered to fix my music box after all I've done to you -- striking you, shocking you. Why?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Do you want me to fix your music box, or don't you?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Yes. Yes, please.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then I want to know your name. Your first name.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Danielle. My name is Danielle.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[working on the music box] And how did you come to be on this Island, Danielle?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle sighs and looks like she doesn't want to talk about it, but she will as if for the price of the music box.]
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	We were part of a science team.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A science team armed with rifles? Was Robert on the team?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Yes.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And Alex, was he, too?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Our vessel was 3 days out of Tahiti when our instruments malfunctioned. It was night, a storm, the sounds. The ship slammed into rocks, ran aground, the hull breached beyond repair. So, we made camp, dug out this temporary shelter. Temporary. Nearly 2 months we survived here, 2 months before --
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Your distress signal? The message I heard, you said, "It killed them all."
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	We were coming back from the Black Rock. It was them. They were the carriers.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who were the carriers?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	The others.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What others? What is the Black Rock? Have you seen other people on this Island?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	No, but I hear them. Out there, in the jungle. They whisper. [Long Pause.] You think I'm insane.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I think you've been alone for too long.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid going into Nadia's solitary confinement cell.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[giving her bread] I'm sorry, this is all I could find. I'll try and bring you some fruit later on. Are you ready to talk?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	That depends on what you'd like to talk about, Sayid. Books, weather? Since I've seen neither locked in this cell for weeks, I'm afraid my conversation will suffer.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We have two suspects in custody. Have a look at these photographs. All you need to do is nod. If you prove you are willing to cooperate, I think I can get them to free you.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Then I won't have these visits to look forward to anymore.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This isn't a game, Nadia.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Yet, you keep playing it, Sayid -- pretending to be something I know you're not.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Shannon sunning on beach.]
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You're never going to believe this.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You finally learned how to tie your own shoes?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Funny. Someone at the caves built a golf course.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Are you high?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Seriously, a golf course. Apparently, Jack's playing with them right now.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack? Is golfing?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	That's what I hear. I don't know about you guys but I'm going to go check this out.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Wait for me, bonehead.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Doctor playing golf. Woo, boy howdy, now I've heard everything. What's next, cop eating a donut?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You want to come you should just say.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I think I'll pass on that, Freckles. Not big on crowds. And let's face it, the crowd's not too hot on me, either.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	One outcast to another -- I'd think about making more of an effort.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Duly noted.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid in Danielle's place with the working music box.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You see, some things can be fixed.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Danielle, please let me go.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Go?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Back to the people I told you about.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You can't. You have to stay. It's not safe.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Not safe, what's not safe?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You need me! You can't leave.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Danielle...
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear sounds outside and Danielle picks up a rifle and heads to the hatch.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Where are you going?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	If we're lucky, it's one of the bears.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If we're lucky? It might be that thing out there -- the monster.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	There's no such thing as monsters.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid and Omar at their base.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	You have to execute her.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	The Jazeem woman has given us nothing. This will send a message to the others who will not talk.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I just need more time with her.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	You have had more than a month, Sayid. Now bring her outside and shoot her. Or I will. Is this a problem?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, it's not a problem.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	Good.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Nadia in her cell.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	What did you bring me today?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid throws an execution hood at her side.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Put it on.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Sayid using the screwdriver from when he fixed the music box to get out of his chains. He grabs Danielle's maps, and his pack, and a rifle. The photos of Nadia get left behind.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of golf course.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ugh!
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, I think he stuck it.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Lucky, lucky.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	This thing have a ladies team?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, when did you show up?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	A while ago. I almost didn't recognize you. You're smiling.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll have to watch that.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So how'd you come up with this?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wasn't me -- it's all Hurley. I've been going crazy trying to make everyone feel safe. I haven't been sleeping because I want everyone to feel safe. And he builds a golf course and everyone feels safe.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[after missing the ball completely] Aw, crap, do over.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's a mulligan, mulligan. It's a gentleman's sport, you've got to get the words right. Mulligan.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, come here. Check this out.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[hugging Hurley from behind] You want to -- let me.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, get away from me.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	You left me alone at the caves.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What? I left you with Claire.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	She's sleeping.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oh, man. I'm sorry. I just... I just got caught up. I'm really sorry Walt. I screwed up. I'll make it up to you. Hey, you want to play?
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Nah, there's other people waiting.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oh no, don't worry about it, they won't mind. You want to take a swing?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Michael, it's your shot. You're up.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oh, okay, cool. [to Walt] So we'll play later, okay?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid in jungle. He levels his rifle at Danielle.]
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Put the gun down, Danielle. Put it down on the ground.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She doesn't, she levels her rifle at him.]
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Don't.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid walking down a corridor with Nadia in the hood.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to two soldiers] I'll take it from here.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The soldiers leave, and Sayid runs with Nadia.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	[terrified] What's... what's going on?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	40 meters outside this door there's a supply truck that will be leaving shortly. They don't check them on the way out, only coming in. Get inside. Cover yourself any way that you can. They won't reach the city for 30 minutes, that's enough time for you to jump out and hide yourself.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Come with me.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I can't. Desertion. They would kill my family. I don't have your courage.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	You have more than you know.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She takes the photos out and writes something on the back.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nadia, you have to go.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	[off camera at first] Sayid. What are you doing?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Omar reaches for his gun.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Don't.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OMAR	[shouts] Guards!
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid shoots him.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Sayid, now you have to come with me! They'll kill you!
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, you escaped, you stole my gun and you shot him. And then you shot me.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid shoots himself in the leg.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Sayid!
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[giving her the gun] Take it. Please, Nadia. Take it and go.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Nadia takes the gun and runs. Sayid looks at the message she wrote on the back of the photo.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Danielle.]
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Please, I don't wish to hurt you.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You already have.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Don't.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid fires, but nothing happens.]
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	The firing pin has been removed. Robert didn't notice it was missing, either -- when I shot him.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	But you loved him.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	He was sick.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Sick?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	It took them, one after the other. I had no choice. They were already lost.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You killed them?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	What would have happened if we were rescued? I couldn't let that happen. I won't!
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid throws the rifle down.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm not sick.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	I know.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then why kill me?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	I can't let you go. Don't you understand, to have someone to talk to, to touch --
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	"You'll find me in the next life if not in this one."
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	What?
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The writing on the back of Nadia's photograph. I know what it's like to hold on to someone. I've been holding on for the past 7 years to just a thought, a blind hope that somewhere she's still alive. But the more I hold on, the more I pull away from those around me. The only way out of this, this place, is with their help. Come with me. You don't have to be alone, Danielle.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Your people -- the ones you're determined to get back to -- watch them, watch them closely.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Danielle, who is Alex?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Alex was my child.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Meanwhile, back at the golf course, Charlie is picking grass out his way as Michael laughs.]
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Guys, please. I've never made par on a course before.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He takes his shot and misses.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, you were robbed.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Bollocks. See that?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Okay, Jack. It's up to you. Sink this you get to wear the blazer.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No pressure.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, no pressure.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	5 bucks says he sinks it.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, you're betting against me?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry, dude, but you're a duffer like me.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Make it 10 and you're on.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SULLIVAN	I don't have any cash, but I'll bet my dinner on the Doc.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I've two tubes of sunscreen and a flashlight says he chokes.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone just stares at Sawyer for a minute.]
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll take that action.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah, yeah, me too.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You just bet on Jack, dumb-ass.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	We need the sunscreen, Princess.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack takes his shot, but we don't see it.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke's knife flying into a tree, instead.]
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Does your father know you're here?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	[shaking his head] Can you teach me how to do that?
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke hands Walt the knife.]
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid walking through the jungle. Sound of wind, birds wings, whispering voices.]
