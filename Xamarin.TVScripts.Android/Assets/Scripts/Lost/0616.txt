The End
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Damon Lindelof, & Carlton Cuse
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - at LAX, airline cargo marked with "Christian Shephard" and "human remains" is being unloaded from an Oceanic plane - Jack is at the hospital, at his office desk - he examines a head x-ray.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack is washing his face at a stream - he stares at his trembling hands.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - another view of the Oceanic cargo - Ben, in an arm sling, is getting a cup of a coffee.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Ben is loading bullets into a magazine while Locke is winding rope]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Locke glances at a wheelchair, as he is being wheeled into surgery - Christian's coffin is loaded into an Oceanic delivery truck - Sawyer glances in a mirror at his station as he prepares for work.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Kate, Sawyer, Hurley are together at camp; Sawyer examines Kate's wound.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Oceanic truck leaves with Christian's coffin.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sawyer continues to examine Kate's wound.]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Kate sits in the passenger seat of Hurley's Camaro, waiting outside a Eloise's church as the Oceanic delivery truck arrives - Desmond assists the driver with removing the casket.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Do you need someone to sign for that?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER	You work here?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I do indeed, brother.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DRIVER	You a priest or something?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Or something... Do you mind taking it around the back there?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DRIVER	Yeah, sure. You got it.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Driver wheels Christian's casket towards the church.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[pointing] Just around there, thank you.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond gets behind the wheel of the Camaro.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Who died?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	A man named Christian Shephard.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[chuckling] Christian Shephard? Seriously?
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Seriously.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Friend of yours?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Not exactly.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate grabs onto his hand as he tries to start the engine.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	H-hang on a second. You bust me out of jail, and make me put on this dress so that we can go to some concert. And you won't even tell me why were here.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No one can tell you why you're here, Kate... Certainly not me.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're the one who brought me here.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm not talking about the church. I'm talking about here.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Who are you? What do you want?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	My name is Desmond Hume. And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend. And, as for what I want--I want to leave.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Leave and go where?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Let me show you.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - From a distance, Kate looks at Jack standing in water - Sawyer approaches Jack.]
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You okay?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. You?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, to be honest, Doc, I'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That makes two of us.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So, you're the new Jacob, huh? [Jack nods] Feel any different?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not really.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, Doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack speaks to the group around the campfire.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp. Just past it, well, said I'd find the place we need to protect.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	This place, what is it?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He called it the heart of the island. All he said was that it's...it's a light.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And that Locke Smoke Thing wants to put it out?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Something like that, yeah.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, what if he does?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then that's it for all of us.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	But, if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	'Cause he ain't got what he needs. I'm guessing that'd be Desmond... That's where we were headed before your inauguration. Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jacob didn't say anything to me about Desmond.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Doesn't sound like he said anything about anything.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's kinda of true, dude. He's worse than Yoda.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All right. Y'all head to your heart of the island and I'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If I leave a trail, can you catch up with us?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hell, yeah I can.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then be safe.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'd ask you along, but that'd take all of the fun out me telling you, you can't come.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh, I guess I'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I've got a bad feeling about this.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Hurley and Sayid arrive at the Flightline motel.]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know why you got me out of prison, what you want or who you are. But, you understand, I can't be held responsible for--
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, yeah. Whatever, dude.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley shows Sayid a tranquilizer gun.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	None of this is ringing a bell, is it? You me, tranquilizer gun?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You are insane.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, fine. I'm insane. Just wait here.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What if I don't?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Then, that's your choice. But, if you stick with me...you'll be happy you did.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley knocks on door.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie opens the door with a bottle of alcohol, holding up sign.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	"Do not disturb" sign... Who are you? Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and I'm here to pick you up.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Didn't I make it clear to Widmore's other monkey? I don't care about a sodding concert.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Charlie? Charlie, what if I told you that...playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do? Would you come then?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sod off.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, dude. Sorry about this.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley shoots Charlie with the tranquilizer gun and carries him to his Hummer.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What was that?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That was Charlie.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack, Kate and Hurley are walking through the jungle.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why did you take the job, Jack?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I was supposed to.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I took it because the island's all I've got left. It's the only thing in my life I haven't managed to ruin.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You haven't ruined anything. Nothing is irreversible.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer spies on Locke, who is winding a rope - Ben points a rifle at Sawyer and forces him into the open.]
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	As long as you're watching, why don't you join us?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you doing here, James?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I heard Desmond fell in the well, so I came to help him get out. [looks into the well] Looks like somebody beat us both to the punch. Oh well.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Do you know why I'm here?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm guessing you need Desmond to destroy the island.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That's absolutely right.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Then what, Smokey? You going down with the ship? Suicide doesn't seem like your style.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm not going down with anything. But you and the rest of Jacob's little "candidates", absolutely are.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We're not candidates anymore.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer elbows Ben in the face and takes his rifle.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Ahh! Ohh! Aah.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll be seein' ya.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You're not gonna go after him?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't need to.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone? I'm sorry if I left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean. That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat. Because once we get Desmond to do, what we need him to do, I'm going to sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink. [notices animal prints in the dirt] I think there was a dog here.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond is at the camp of Rose, Bernard - Vincent awakens him by licking his face.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Morning.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Morning. Sleep okay?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye. Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Are you gonna talk his ear off or get the man some breakfast?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Guess I'll go check the traps for fish... Come on. Vincent. Let's go.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So, Rose, tell me...how long have the two of you been living here?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, we built this place in '75 and lived here a couple of years and then the sky lit up again. So God only know when the hell we are now. So...Desmond...I don't mean to be rude, but after you eat, I'm gonna ask you to move on. We broke our rule with you.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What rule is that?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	We don't get involved. Whatever got you tossed inside the well...that's the kind of drama Bernard and I don't want to have anything to do with.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Fair enough.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Vincent barks, Bernard returns.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Looks like you caught something.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I'm sorry.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke and Ben walk into camp.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello, Rose... [to Desmond] I'll make this simple. Come with me now or I'll kill them both right in front of you.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You don't have to go anywhere with him.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond looks to Rose.]
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'll make it hurt.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I want your word. You won't touch them--ever.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Done.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Then I'll do what you want.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes, Desmond. You will.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Desmond, Ben walking through the jungle - it is thundering.]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You have any idea where I'm taking you, Desmond?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No. But, I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What makes you say that?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh. Just a hunch.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke looks at Ben when he hears radio static.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What was that?
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	What was what?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben turns off his walkie-talkie - scene changes to Miles and unconscious Richard.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Linus, can you hear me? Come in...I found Alpert. [Richard stirs] Linus... Damn it! You okay?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	What--what--what happened?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	You thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke. It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Locke--L...is he still here?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	No...I've been trying to get Linus on the walkie, he won't pick up... Come on, let's get you some help.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Help? Help? Help from where? You still have the explosives, the--the C-4?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah. Why?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Because we need to go the other island to finish what we started. We need to blow up that plane.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Museum concert venue - Miles arrives and sees Sayid in Hurley's Hummer - uses his cell phone.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Detective Ford.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Jim, it's me...I think I just saw that Jarrah guy.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You at county lockup?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	No, I'm at my dad's museum concert benefit thing.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, it can't be Jarrah. I just put him in a van to county an hour ago.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Really? Because I just called, and they said it never showed up.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Help me out here, Jim. Jarrah popped four people in cold blood. Only one witness left the scene alive, right? Some Korean woman. Can you make sure she's okay?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik. Gunshot wound. She's still over at the hospital. Enjoy your concert, Enos. I'll keep her safe.

332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet sets up an ultrasound machine.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit. [applying gel to Sun's abdomen] It's a little cold... Okay. Let's take a look.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Low magnetic zaps - Sun has visual memories of Juliet performing an ultrasound on her in the medical station on the island - Sun gasps.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You okay?

354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Do you see that little flutter? Right there? That's the baby's heartbeat. Perfectly perfect in every way. I have your amnio results. Everything checked out. Would you like to know if it's a boy or girl?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	It's a girl.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yeah.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Her name is Ji Yeon.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	That's a lovely name... And for the record, y-you two speak English just fine. Congratulations.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer runs and meets up with Jack, Hurley and Kate.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Whoa!
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me...I found Locke. The son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the island. You had it right, Doc. Good news is, Desmond got out of that well. So, if we can find him before Smokey can--
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James. We're all going to the same place anyway.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Then what?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then it ends.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group marches on.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack speaks with Locke who is about to be wheeled into the operating room.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hello, Mr. Locke.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Dr. Shephard. Hey, since you're about to open up my back, you can probably start calling me John.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, John. I thought I'd stop by and say hi before we started the anesthesia. You nervous?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Are you sure this is going to work?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yes. I'm very confident that it will.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Really?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, there's always the chance that I could kill you...but, I'm trying to make you feel better.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Okay. Okay, let's do it.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All right. I'll see you on the other side.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey, Doctor, back at L.A.X. when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father. Did he ever turn up?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning. They, uh, they found the coffin.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, good.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Actually, it might be here already.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, I hope that brings you some peace.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	If I can fix you, Mr. Locke, that's all the peace I'll need.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard and Miles put their things in an outrigger and get ready to leave.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	It's gonna be a hell of a storm.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Welcome to the club. [points at Richard's hair]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	What?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Do you mind?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles picks a hair from Richard's head.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Looks like you got your first grey hair.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard takes the hair, looks at it, and smiles.]
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	What are you smiling about?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	I think I just realized that I wanna live.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Well, it's good timing.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard and Miles row the outrigger in the ocean. Something hits their boat.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	What was that?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They discover that it's the body of someone from Widmore's submarine.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Help!
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Hey! Miles, up ahead!
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles and Richard see Frank in the ocean.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Hey! Wha...
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles and Richard rescue Frank.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Get him some water.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard gives Frank water.]
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	What are you guys doing out here?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	We're going to Hydra island to blow up the plane.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	What do you want to do that for?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Because the black smoke wants to get off the island. We have to stop that thing from leaving.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Well, if we leave, that thing won't have a plane anymore.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	And how are we going to do that?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Ben and Desmond are walking up a hill. Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley meet them on the way.]
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, this is gonna be interesting.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate takes Sawyer's rifle, cocks it, and starts shooting at Locke.]
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kate! Kate!
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You killed them!
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kate! [tries to stop her]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You might wanna save your bullets.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke approaches Jack.]
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So it's you.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. It's me.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jacob being who he is, I expected to be a little more surprised. You're sort of the obvious choice, don't you think?
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He didn't choose me. I volunteered.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I assume you're here to stop me.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I can't stop you. In fact, I uh, wanna go with you.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm sorry, Jack. I think you're a little confused about what I came here to do.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No I'm not. No, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest. To the place that I've sworn that I'll protect. And then you think you're gonna destroy the Island.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[surprised] I think?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[smiles] That's right. Because that's not what's gonna happen.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Then what's gonna happen, Jack?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm gonna kill you.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How do you plan to do that?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's a surprise.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Okay. Then let's get on with it.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack is working at the hospital. He goes to drop off some papers at a desk. Juliet, also working at the hospital, shows up to do the same.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Doctor.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[smiles] Doctor.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I didn't know you were working today.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I just finished. Did you get the tickets for the concert?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yep. Right here. [hands her the tickets]
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[David walks towards them.]
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hey dad, did you remember the tickets?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I just gave 'em to your mom.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet gives the tickets to David.]
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[looks at the tickets, then looks at Jack] Uh, who's gonna take yours?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, if you don't have anybody else, maybe you could take aunt Claire. I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[David looks at Juliet.]
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh yeah, it's fine with me. In fact I'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister you never mentioned the entire time we were married.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her. She's extremely pregnant.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet and Jack share a laugh.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Good luck on your surgery, doctor.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet and David head towards the elevator.]
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thank you.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Did you pick out a tie?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I did.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Elevator door opens. Sawyer walks out of the elevator and towards the reception desk.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hi. I'm detective Ford, L.A.P.D.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RECEPTIONIST	M-hm.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm looking for a patient's room. Sun Paik.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack's and Locke's groups are trekking through the jungle.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Something you wanna share with the rest of us, Doc?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's that?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You said you were gonna kill Locke. What's your surprise?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Desmond.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How's that gonna work?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob would have brought him all the way back to this Island just so Locke could make him destroy it.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So, what, Desmond is bait?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. I think he's a weapon.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's a hell of a long con, Doc.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They reach the bamboo forest. Locke stops and draws his knife.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack, Desmond. It should just be the three of us from here on.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack nods. Locke holsters his knife. Jack and Desmond start to follow Locke. Hurley approaches Jack.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack. I believe in you, dude.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack nods and leaves.]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Thunder and rain can be heard as Locke, Desmond and Jack make their way through the forest.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[looks up] Gonna be a bad one.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They reach the stream in front of the light cave.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We're here.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke ties some rope to a tree, Jack ties it to Desmond.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	This doesn't matter, you know.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Him destroying the Island, you destroying him. It doesn't matter. You know, you're gonna lower me into that light, and I'm gonna go somewhere else. A place where we can be with the ones we love, and not have to ever think about this damn Island again. And you know the best part, Jack?
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're in this place. You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815. It never crashed. We spoke to each other. You seemed happy. You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there too.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Desmond, I tried that once. There are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. Trust me, I know. All of this matters.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Shall we?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They go inside the cave. They reach a waterfall which leads to the light.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Hurley and Sayid are sitting in a car on the street at night.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are we doing here?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not allowed to tell you.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do you mean you're not allowed?
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	There are rules, dude.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Whose rules?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay? I trust you.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And what, may I ask, have I done to deserve your trust?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I think you're a good guy, Sayid. You know, a lot of people have told you that you're not. Maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it. You can't let other people tell you what you are, dude. You have to decide that for yourself.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm sorry. You clearly don't know anything about me.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I know a lot about you, dude.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They see a man get beat up in an alley behind a bar.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Looks like a gnarly fight.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley watches Sayid's reaction.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Hey, leave my brother alone.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The attacker pushes Shannon, causing Sayid to get out of the car. He subdues the attacker and helps Shannon up.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Hey, it's alright.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They both have visions of the time they shared on the Island.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Sayid.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Shannon.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone shows up at Hurley's car.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	I just got pounded, man. Thanks for taking your sweet time.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It takes as long as it takes.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	It was a pain in the ass getting her here from Australia.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, but dude, it was worth it.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Should I go get 'em?
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nah, let's give 'em a minute.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon and Sayid kiss.]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley, Ben, Kate and Sawyer are waiting at the bamboo forest.]
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer offers Kate some water. Kate declines.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben's radio starts making noises.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Linus, are you there?
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell is that?
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Miles, where are you?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles is on the beach of Hydra Island. Richard is helping Frank out of the outrigger.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	We just got to Hydra Island. We're on our way to the plane.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Miles, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	We're not gonna blow it up, we're gonna fly it the hell off the Island. Just get over here now.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	[looks toward the trees] What in the hell?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire emerges out of the trees.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Claire.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[takes the radio from Ben] Miles, it's Kate. Did you say Claire? Is she okay?
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire cocks her rifle and points it at Miles' group.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Put the gun down.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire fires two warning shots in their direction.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Don't come any closer!
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Miles? Miles, what happened? Miles, are you there?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	He sent you here to kill me, didn't he?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	No, listen. We're not with Locke.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[unconvinced] Why should I believe you?
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Because we have a real chance to get far far away from him. We can be free from everything he ever did to us, and never look back. We can go home.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire puts down her gun.]
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Will you come with us, Claire?
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[looks sad] No. [walks away]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Locke and Desmond are at the waterfall inside the cave.]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All right we...we lower him down nice and easy.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know what to do once you get down there?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye. I go where the light's brightest.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't get yourself killed.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They lower Desmond with a rope.]
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	This remind you of anything, Jack?
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Desmond...going down into a hole in the ground. If there was a button down there to push, we could fight about whether or not to push it. It'd be just like old times.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're not John Locke. You disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him. Turns out he was right about most everything. I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	He wasn't right about anything, Jack. And when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it, you're finally gonna realize that.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The rope goes slack. They both look down the waterfall.]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Claire, David and Juliet are in line for the benefit concert - Juliet answers a page.]
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh...it's the hospital
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I'm so sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can. [kisses David on forehead]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I know. It's cool. Go.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[to Claire] We'll get to know each other better, I hope?
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, yeah, sure... Well, I, uh, I guess it's just you and me, kid.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie is asleep on a couch, a woman attempts to awaken him.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Oi... Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, What you doin'?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	I'm just following the instructions... You're in the band, aren't you?
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	How do you know that?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte shows Charlie a note "BASS PLAYER WAKE ME UP FOR SHOW".]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh...I was shot by a fat man. [stumbles getting up] It's all right.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[to a man who entered the room] Excuse me... Hey, excuse me. Do you know where the band is?
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	[stares] I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[pointing to Charlie] I-I think he's in the band.
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Yes, yes. Of course. He's the bass player from Drive Shaft. They're accompanying me tonight. I play piano...I'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They shake hands.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	I'm Charlotte.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	It's a great pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	You, too.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Outside, Claire and David make their way to a table.]
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Well, lead the way.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Excuse me. Is this table 23?
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye, indeed it is.
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire is shocked to see who's sitting there.]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Claire.
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I...
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You two know each other?
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN ON MICROPHONE	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention, please? Welcome to this very special benefit concert for the Golden State Natural History Museum. I'm Dr. Pierre Chang. [applause] Thank you. I think we have quite a special evening ahead of us. [camera pans to Eloise in audience] So, let's get to it, shall we? It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Daniel Widmore accompanied by Drive Shaft.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Cheering and applause as musicians take the stage - Charlotte is seated with Miles - Charlie is mesmerized when he sees Claire - she grabs her belly in response to discomfort.]
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Mm.
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You okay?
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, yeah. I'm just--I'm just gonna use the bathroom. I'll--I'll be right back...
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate follows Claire - Desmond stares knowingly.]
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At the bottom of the waterfall, Desmond finds a chamber after passing skeletons - he comes to a bright pool of water into which flows water - there is a large, engraved stone in the center of the pool - he steps into the pond and hears rattling, loud buzzing and magnetic humming - he screams from the pain of electromagnetic shock - Jack and Locke look down at the glow.]
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aah! Aah! Aah!
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[His nose begins to bleed - he removes the elongated stone, which functions as a plug, with difficulty - loud buzzing and humming continues and then gradually fades.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Uhh!
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The water drains from the pool into the center hole - the light goes dark - it is momentarily quiet - a loud rumbling comes from beneath the now-empty pool - a red hot glow filters in through the hole.]
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No! No!
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It looks like...you were wrong... Goodbye, Jack.
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The ground briefly shakes violently - Locke leaves the cave - Jack follows and tackles Locke to the ground.]
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Uhh!
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack punches Locke - Locke is shocked to realize his mouth is bleeding.]
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[smiling] Looks like you were wrong, too.
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack chokes Locke, who defends himself by hitting Jack in the head with a stone - Locke runs off with his backpack in hand.]
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Claire is backstage and comes upon a man - Kate catches up to her.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, hello. Hello? [to man] Hi, uh, do you know where the bathroom is? [Claire is bent over with pain] Umm. Oh.
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to man] Uh, can you please get a doctor?
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man leaves.]
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Claire] Small world, huh?
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, well, what are you doing--mm! Oh!
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[grabs Claire] Oh! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Come on. Sit down.
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Um, I-I think he's coming.
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[While the band and Daniel play, Eloise joins Desmond at his table.]
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	I thought I made it clear that you were to stop this.
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Perfectly clear. I chose to ignore you.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	And once they know...what then?
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We're leaving.
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Are you going to take my son?
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Not with me...no.
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back inside, Claire is in labor.]
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uhh!
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Just breathe, okay? Just breathe, breathe, breathe. Help is on the way.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Mnh-mnh! It's hap--it's happening. Like--like, right now.
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie joins them.]
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Right now... Um. Okay. I'm...I'm gonna get you comfortable. I want you to relax and breathe, all right? Just relax and breathe.
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Who are you?
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm with the band.
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Uhh!
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Charlie] Listen, can you get us some water and blankets, please?
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Water and blankets?
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. [Charlie leaves] All right. Uh...this is about the time when you're supposed to start pushing
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I'm not ready. I'm really scared.
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm scared too, all right? Really scared. But I'm gonna need you to push because I can't do it without you. Okay? Okay? One, two, three. Push! [Claire grunts as she pushes] Good, that's good. Okay, we're gonna try again. You're doin' good. One, two, three. Push!
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Low magnetic zap - Kate has Island memory flashes of assisting Claire with Aaron's birth.]
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Push, push again.
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Low magnetic zap - Kate delivers the baby - Claire has the same memory flashes when Kate hands her the baby.]
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh!
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Low magnetic zap - Island timeline birth scenes are interspersed with sideways timeline birth scenes - baby cries.]
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Shh... It's Aaron. It's...
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Claire are sobbing and laughing when Charlie rejoins them with blankets.]
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I brought a blanket.
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Claire realize who Charlie is.]
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thank you.
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's just a blanket.
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Then go ahead and bring it to her.
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Couldn't find any water.
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Low magnetic zapping - Claire grasps Charlie's hand causing Island memory flashes.]
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Charlie.
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire? Claire.
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss - Aaron cries.]
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hi, Aaron. Hey. Shh. It's okay... Hey, Aaron.
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond stands near Kate.]
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Do you understand?
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So now what?
948	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - in a thunder storm and a continuous series of earthquakes, a tree splinters and crashes toward Hurley.]
950	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hugo, get out the way!
952	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben is pinned after pushing Hurley out of the way.]
954	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Ohh!
956	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack regains consciousness and reenters the cave.]
958	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Desmond! [he pulls on the untethered rope] Desmond!
960	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[After looking around outside the cave, Jack purposefully trots off.]
962	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Ben] We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
964	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley, Kate and Sawyer attempt to free Ben.]
966	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's too damn heavy. There's no way we're gettin' it off him.
968	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We have to try.
970	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	One...two...three!
972	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another earthquake.]
974	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What is happening?
976	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'll tell you what's happening! Locke was right! This Island's goin' down!
978	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walkie-talkie sounds.]
980	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Come in!
982	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Miles. Is that you?
984	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah. What the hell is happening?
986	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you with Claire?
988	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	She's here, but she doesn't want to come with us.
990	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Come with you where?
992	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Lapidus is working on the plane right now. Then we're taking off... Hey, how much longer 'til we get this thing in the air?
994	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	I still have to check the electrical and the hydraulics. Five hours, maybe six.
996	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	You've got maybe one.
998	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Get your asses over here! We're leaving in an hour!
1000	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son of a bitch! How the hell are we supposed to get over there?
1002	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I know how we can get there! Locke has a boat.
1004	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke has arrived at the cliff side where the Elizabeth is anchored just off shore.]
1006	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	LOCKE!
1008	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack has reached the cliff side. Locke draws his knife, and the two run at each other, with Jack raising his fist to strike him.]
1010	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Locke trade blows, with Locke ultimately stabbing Jack in his side, he then holds the knife over Jack's throat, trying to kill him.]
1012	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I want you to know Jack, you died for nothing!
1014	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A gunshot rings out, striking Locke in the back. The shooter is revealed to be Kate, who has arrived at the cliff side.]
1016	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I saved you a bullet!
1018	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another tremor shakes the Island.]
1020	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're too late.
1022	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The tremor stops and Locke looks to realize that his plan has failed, and Jack kicks Locke off the cliff side, killing him as he hits the rocks below.]
1024	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack is walking down a hallway of the hospital alongside a post operation Locke, who is being rolled down the hallway by a nurse.]
1026	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Nice work, Dr. Shephard. What happened to your neck?
1028	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack checks his neck to discover it is once again bleeding.]
1030	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to himself] Damn it.
1032	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack enters Lock's hospital room wiping his neck.]
1034	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	OK, he's stable. I'm gonna hop in the shower and see if I can catch up with David before the concert's over. Just give me a call if you need me.
1036	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Dr. Shephard? He's waking up. I watched the anesthesiologist...he got the full dosage.
1038	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	OK. I'll take it from here. Mr. Locke. Can you hear me? John, are you awake?
1040	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke opens eyes slowly looking at Jack. Jack smiles.]
1042	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You just had major surgery so I need you to try not to move and just relax, OK?
1044	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It worked.
1046	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uh...it went well...but we wont know how you responded to the surgery--
1048	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, Dr. Shephard, it worked. I can feel my legs.
1050	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John, it's highly unlikely that you would regain sensation that quickly so lets just take it slo--
1052	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at Locke's feet moving under the sheet.]
1054	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[looking at feet] Oh.
1056	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack moves to the foot of the bed and uncovers Locke's foot. Foot wiggles. Locke has island memory flashes: Seeing his stocking feet wiggle right after the crash, orange peel in his mouth for teeth, Walt throwing a knife at the target, in the rain with Boone, reacting to the smoke monster that did not attack him.]
1058	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh. Did you see that?
1060	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	See what?
1062	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke smiles at Jack.]
1064	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You don't remember?
1066	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack momentarily has a flash of looking down the hatch with Locke but shakes his head as to clear it.]
1068	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Um... Mr. Locke [shaking head, covers Locke's feet] Please just, ah, just relax. What we need to do...
1070	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What we need to do is go...
1072	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, no, no...hey. John...
1074	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Will you come with me?
1076	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're not going anywhere. You just had extensive spinal surgery and I...I need to see my son.
1078	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You don't have a son.
1080	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[walking to the door looking back] What?
1082	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You don't have a son, Jack.
1084	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	[entering] Doctor?
1086	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jean, um, would you give Mr. Locke something to help him rest? I need to go.
1088	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack...I hope that somebody does for you what you just did for me.
1090	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Looks are exchanged between smiling Locke and confused Jack. Jack exits the room.]
1092	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Kate helps Jack away from the edge of the cliff.]
1094	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Oh my god.
1096	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ahh.
1098	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack examines his stab wound.]
1100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack...
1102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm fine. Just find me some thread and I can count to five.
1104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Hurley and Ben approach them.]
1106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey! Oh my god. What the hell happened?
1108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Locke's dead...it's over.
1110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks over the cliff to see Locke's body laying motionless on the rocks. The ground shakes.]
1112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sure don't feel like it's over.
1114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Detective Ford enters Sun and Jin's hospital room as they are preparing to leave.]
1116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Excuse me, Miss...Paik?
1118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes.
1120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hi. I'm Detective Ford, LAPD. I'm sorry I heard you were shot, I didn't expect you to be checking out so soon. [to Jin] Hey.
1122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin is smiling at Sawyer.]
1124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Hello. Detective.
1126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well I came by to check if you've seen this man. [He shows them a photo of Sayid.] He escaped custody, and we're worried he might come after you. I'm gonna assign a uniform to keep an eye on you until we can app--
1128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	You don't have to do that.
1130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun and Jin start to leave the room.]
1132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	All due respect, I have a job to do here ma'am. I need to keep you safe.
1134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	It's okay, I am safe.
1136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They open the door and leave.]
1138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	We'll see you there.
1140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	See me where?
1142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - At the Hydra Island runway. The ground shakes. Inside the Ajira plane, Frank checks the repairs he made.]
1144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Alright. It ain't pretty, but it's gonna work. Gotta reset the electronics.
1146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frank flips some switches and a beeping noise starts.]
1148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Something's wrong with the hydraulics down at the nose wheel. You know any guys mechanical? Yeah?
1150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Well, I--I worked for a--a contractor renovating apartments for a couple of summers--
1152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	[rips page from manual] Take that! And this, and this. [He gives him a flashlight and some duct tape] Go down there and make sure everything's hooked up right. Go!
1154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[on walkie] Lapidus?
1156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Yeah?
1158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Frank, how's it going over there? What's your timetable?
1160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Don't bother me!
1162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He throws the walkie-talkie onto the seat.]
1164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Sounds like they're making progress.
1166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The ground shakes violently.]
1168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We gotta go now.
1170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't understand. Locke's dead, why is this still happening?
1172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because whatever Desmond turned off...I need to turn it back on again. But if it doesn't work, if I don't get it done you all need to leave now. You need to get on that plane.
1174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You can come with us too, Jack. You don't have to do this.
1176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No I do have to do this.
1178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, you don't! Let the Island sink, Jack.
1180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate...I can't. [to Sawyer] You think you can get that boat across the channel in time?
1182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I can manage.
1184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets up and shakes Sawyer's hand.]
1186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good luck to you, James.
1188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thanks, doc...for everything.
1190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	James!
1192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben throws him the walkie-talkie.]
1194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	If the Island's going down, I'm going down with it.
1196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hugo, you better get going.
1198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh-uh, no way. You think I'm going down that? I'm with you, dude.
1200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay. Kate...you gotta go. Get Claire on that plane.
1202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Tell me I'm gonna see you again.
1204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shakes his head. They kiss each other.]
1206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I love you.
1208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I love you.
1210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Hurley and Ben leave while Kate cries.]
1212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Zoom in to plane wheel with Richard and Miles' legs working in the wheel well. Miles peels off some duct tape while Richard is looking at schematics and holding the flashlight for Miles. Miles puts another layer of tape on a wire bundle.]
1214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Can you fix it?
1216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	I don't believe in a lot of things but I do believe in duct tape. Yeah, I think we're good.
1218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ground shakes.]
1220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Let's get the hell out of here.
1222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Kate walking along the cliff.]
1224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[into walkie-talkie] Yo Chesty, Sawyer and Kate...
1226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard picks up walkie-talkie.]
1228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Yeah?
1230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We're on our way down to the sailboat then we're heading to you...don't leave without us.
1232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Lapidus grabbing the walkie-talkie.]
1234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	We're getting off the ground while there's still ground to get off. So if you wanna go you better get your asses in gear.
1236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He throws the walkie again.]
1238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Lapidus! Lapidus! Son of a bitch.
1240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What now?
1242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks to the sailboat and tosses the backpack away.]
1244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We jump.
1246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'll see you at the boat.
1248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate jumps off the ledge.]
1250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kate!
1252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer dives off the ledge. They both swim to the boat.]
1254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Sawyer is walking down the hospital corridor. He stops Jack has he passes by.]
1256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, you know where I could get some grub around here?
1258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Uhh... the cafeteria's closed, but there's a vending machine down the hallway.
1260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thanks, doc.
1262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, no problem.
1264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer looks on as Jack walks away, pausing for a moment. At the vending machine he flattens out his dollar bill and inserts it into the machine. He presses the buttons for an Apollo bar (G23), but it gets stuck in the machine.]
1266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, come on...
1268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He shakes the machine but the bar doesn't budge.]
1270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Unbelievable.
1272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He attempts to reach inside the machine to grab the bar. A woman approaches.]
1274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Can I help you?
1276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's okay... I'm a... I'm a cop.
1278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Mmmm. Maybe you should read the machine its rights?
1280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[laughing] That's funny.
1282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Mmmm... Can I tell you a secret?
1284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Please.
1286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	If you unplug it, and then you plug it back in again... the candy just drops right down.
1288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Is that right?
1290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yes, and it's technically legal.
1292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh... give that a shot...
1294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He unplugs the machine and all the lights in the room go off.]
1296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oops...
1298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet laughs, grabs the bar from the machine and gives it to Sawyer.]
1300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It worked.
1302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs the candy, but as his hand touches Juliet's, they both begin to see flashes of their time together on the Island. They jump back in surprise.]
1304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Oh...
1306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Whoa... did you feel that?
1308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We should get coffee some time.
1310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'd love to but the machine ate my dollar, I only got one left.
1312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We can go dutch.
1314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As she says that last line we see her on the Island, they flash to her dying in Sawyer's arms as she says the same line. Juliet holds Sawyer's hand and they begin to experience more flashes of their 1970's DHARMA life; Sawyer holding up a daisy, them hugging, spooning in bed, more hugging and kissing, Sawyer holding Juliet from falling in The Incident, Juliet falling.]
1316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Juliet? Juliet it's--it's me. Ju--
1318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They embrace and Juliet begins to sob.]
1320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's me babe... I gotcha... I gotcha babe.
1322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet is laughing as she realizes.]
1324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Kiss me, James!
1326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got it blondie...
1328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss each other passionately.]
1330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack arrives at the concert to find that it is already over. He starts to call someone on his cellphone when Kate approaches him.]
1332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's over.
1334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me?
1336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	The concert. It's over. You lookin' for someone?
1338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, my son. I was supposed to bring him here tonight, and then... I couldn't come, and...
1340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate smiles at him. Jack laughs.]
1342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sorry, where do I remember you from?
1344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I stole your pen.
1346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
1348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh... Oceanic 815, from Sydney? I bumped into you coming out of the bathroom, and I stole your pen.
1350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And that's how I know you?
1352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No... that's not how you know me.
1354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks closer to Jack and puts her hands on his face. Jack sees flashes of Kate on the Island.]
1356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I missed you so much.
1358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sees flashes of their first kiss on the Island. He backs away from her, confused.]
1360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you okay?
1362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is happening to me? Wh--who are you? I don't--
1364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I know, you don't understand Jack. But if you come with me... you will.
1366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley helps an injured Jack as they come to the Source. Ben follows behind. The ground shakes.]
1368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's over there.
1370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	How are we getting down there?
1372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're not, I'm going alone.
1374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, you can't go down there alone. If Desmond didn't make it, how the hell are you going to survive?
1376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Hurley exchange looks. Jack just shakes his head.]
1378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No. No way, I'm not gonna let you die.
1380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley, I'm already dead.
1382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You said you'd protect the Island!
1384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And that's what I'm doing.
1386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're committing suicide!
1388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not, this is the way it has to happen! This is what I'm supposed to do.
1390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're not supposed to die! The Island needs you!
1392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley...[putting his hand on Hurley's shoulder] it needs you.
1394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
1396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It needs to be you, Hugo.
1398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[crying] I can't... it's supposed to be you!
1400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It was only supposed to be me so I can do this. But if someone has to take care of the Island, if someone has to protect it then... then it should be you. Hurley... I believe in you.
1402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Alright I'll take it. But it's only temporary, as soon as you get that light back in, I'm pulling you up, and I'm giving it right back to you, deal?!
1404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Deal.
1406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The ground shakes violently again.]
1408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you have anything to drink? Anything to drink out of... uh... a cup, a canteen?
1410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I do. [Ben gives Jack an empty Oceanic water bottle] Is that okay?
1412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's perfect.
1414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He fills it up with stream water.]
1416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Hurley] Drink this.
1418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley drinks the water.]
1420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Is that it?
1422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[putting his hand on Hurley's shoulder again] Now you're like me.
1424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On Hydra Island, inside the Ajira plane.]
1426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Second time's a charm. It better be because we sure as hell don't have the battery power for a third time.
1428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He flips some switches and the engines slowly kick in.]
1430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	That good?
1432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	That my friends, is pure music!
1434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the cave, Hurley and Ben lower Jack down the waterfall.]
1436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Easy. Easy. Easy.
1438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[There's an earthquake and Jack falls the rest of the way.]
1440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ah, ahh.
1442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack finds Desmond unconscious by the side of the pool.]
1444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Desmond! Desmond? Can you hear me?
1446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	The light... I put it out. It didn't work. I thought I'd leave this place.
1448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I got you. Come on. Come on.
1450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack helps Desmond to his feet.]
1452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm still here. You were right Jack.
1454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, there's a first time for everything.
1456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I have to put it back. It was like a drain.
1458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's what you did, you took that stone out of that hole over there?
1460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack begins to tie the rope around Desmond, but he tries to stop him.]
1462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Jack you can't, even if you turn it back on it'll kill you. It has to be me!
1464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Desmond, you've done enough. You wanna do something? Go home and be with your wife and son.
1466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What about you, Jack?
1468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll see you in another life, brother.
1470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On Hydra Island, Kate and Sawyer arrive on the beach.]
1472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Claire?!
1474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The ground shakes and Sawyer notices a piece of the main Island break away and fall into the water.]
1476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, that ain't good.
1478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the plane.]
1480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Miles, go look out the door! You gotta be my eyes while I back this outta here! Richard, go tell me what he says!
1482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On the beach.]
1484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Claire! Are you okay?
1486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They notice the plane as it begins to reverse.]
1488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
1490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Claire, come on please!
1492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I can't!
1494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?!
1496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Look at me! This Island's made me crazy, I--I don't want Aaron to see me like this. I don't even know how to be a mother anymore.
1498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Listen to me, none of us do. Not at first. But you're not alone. Let me help you. Come on, let's go.
1500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the runway.]
1502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Are we clear?!
1504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	[to Miles] Are we clear?!
1506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Yeah looks like it to me!
1508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	[to Frank] He says we're good!
1510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	You better pray we are Ricky boy, because I'm gonna spin her around! Hold on!
1512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Kate and Claire are running for the plane.]
1514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer! Tell him to stop! Tell him we're coming!
1516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[on walkie] Lapidus! Lapidus! Lapidus, hold on!
1518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frank doesn't hear him.]
1520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Alright, we're good to go!
1522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Miles closes the door.]
1524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Let's go!
1526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Richard and Miles buckle up in the cockpit. Frank prepares to take off, but he notices Sawyer, Kate and Claire on the runway.]
1528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	What the hell? Boys we got some late arrivals, open the door. Come on!
1530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the cave - Jack makes it to his feet. He struggles to pick up the stone and slowly drags it to the hole. He pushes the stone into the hole and collapses with exhaustion. Over on Hydra Island, Miles opens the door to the plane and throws some wires out. Claire, Kate and Sawyer climb onto the plane.]
1532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	We're running out of time!
1534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Way to wait until the last second, Jim.
1536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Good to see you too, Enos.
1538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	We got 'em!
1540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Everybody buckle up tight! Hold on!
1542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frank prepares the plane for take off. Outside, the runway begins to crack under the plane.]
1544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Here we go, Frank.
1546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frank accelerates and the plane begins to rocket along the runway. The passengers look nervous. Claire holds onto Kate's hand as Frank attempts to lift the plane into the air.]
1548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Come on. Come on.
1550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane narrowly clears the tops of the trees and takes to the skies. Frank and the rest of the passengers give sighs of relief.]
1552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	FRANK	Amen.
1554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the Source - Jack awaits to see if his plan worked. Water starts to trickle into the pool and a bright yellow light glows from the center. Jack laughs with joy as the light regains it's former brightness and water gushes into the pool.]
1556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He did it, the light's back on.
1558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, pull!
1560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben and Hurley grab the rope and start to pull Desmond up.]
1562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hang on, Jack!
1564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack is still in the pool, laughing, as it fills with water. Desmond is pulled to the top of the waterfall.]
1566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Got him...Desmond? No...Jack! Jack!
1568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Outside the church, Locke pulls up in a taxi. The driver gets out and assits him into his wheelchair. Locke gives him some money.]
1570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Thank you.
1572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He wheels himself to the church, where he stops next to Ben, who is sat on a bench.]
1574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello Benjamin.
1576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello John.
1578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is everyone already inside?
1580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I believe most of them are, yes.
1582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke smiles and starts to leave.]
1584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm very sorry for what I did to you John. I was selfish, jealous. I wanted everything you had.
1586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What did I have?
1588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You were special, John... and I wasn't.
1590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well if it helps, Ben, I forgive you.
1592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Thank you, John...that does help. It matters more than I can say.
1594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you gonna do now?
1596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I have some things I still need to work out. I think I'll stay here a while.
1598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke goes to leave again.]
1600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You know, I don't think you need to be in that chair anymore.
1602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke stops and slowly gets out of his chair, pushing it behind him as he stands.]
1604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Goodbye, Ben.
1606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben nods. Locke walks up the steps and enters the church.]
1608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Outside the cave, Ben rests an unconscious Desmond's head on his backpack. Hurley silently stares into the cave.]
1610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I think Desmond's gonna be okay.
1612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack's...gone...isn't he?
1614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben just nods to confirm it and Hurley breaks down into tears.]
1616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	He did his job, Hugo.
1618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's my job now... What the hell am I supposed to do?
1620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home.
1622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	But how? People can't leave the Island.
1624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's how Jacob ran things... Maybe there's another way. A better way.
1626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Will you help me?
1628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'm sorry?
1630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I could really use someone with like, experience. For a little while. Will you help me, Ben?
1632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'd be honored.
1634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Cool.
1636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Ben is still sat outside the church. Hurley comes outside and sees him.]
1638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, hey dude.
1640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Hello, Hugo!
1642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We're all inside.
1644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I don't think I'm coming in.
1646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley turns to leave then looks back to Ben.]
1648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, you were a real good number two.
1650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	And you were a great number one, Hugo.
1652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Thanks, dude. I'll see ya.
1654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley goes back into the church. Jack and Kate arrive by car.]
1656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do you know where we are?
1658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This is where I was gonna have my father's funeral. He died, in Australia.
1660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sorry.
1662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why did you bring me here?
1664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because this is where you were gonna have your father's funeral. You can go in around back.
1666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Wait, where you going?
1668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Inside. I'll be waiting for you there, once you're ready.
1670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ready for what?
1672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	To leave.
1674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate leaves the car and heads for the church.]
1676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - A bloodied Jack awakes to find himself outside the cave, in a small pond. He staggers to his feet and makes his way out of the pond, holding his stab wound.]
1678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jack makes his way into the back door of the church. He finds himself inside a small chapel with various religious artifacts, and a stained glass window with six symbols of different faiths - Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism and Taoism. His father's coffin is also there. Jack approaches the coffin and circles it before putting his hand on it. As soon as he touches it, he sees a flash of himself waking up on the Island for the first time after the crash. He places his other hand on the coffin, this time seeing more flashes of his time on the Island, just after the crash. More flashes; Locke pulling him up the cliff, saying goodbye to Sawyer, leaving on the helicopter, with Kate in the Hydra, seeing Kate for the first time, their final kiss. As the flashes stop, he backs away from the coffin dazed and confused. Then he opens the coffin to discover it is empty.]
1680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	Hey, kiddo.
1682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack turns around to see his father standing behind him.]
1684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Dad?
1686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Hello, Jack.
1688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't understand...you died.
1690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Yeah. Yes I did...
1692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then how are you here right now?
1694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Christian sighs.]
1696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	How are you here?
1698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I died too...
1700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack begins to cry as he remembers.]
1702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	It's okay...it's okay. It's okay son.
1704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Christian approaches Jack and they hug each other.]
1706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I love you, dad.
1708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	I love you too, son.
1710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You...are you real?
1712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	I should hope so. Yeah, I'm real. You're real, everything that's ever happened to you is real. All those people in the church...they're real too.
1714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They're all...they're all dead?
1716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Everyone dies sometime, kiddo. Some of them before you, some...long after you.
1718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	But why are they all here now?
1720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Well there is no "now" here.
1722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are we, dad?
1724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	This is the place that you...that you all made together, so that you could find one another. The most...important part of your life, was the time that you spent with these people. That's why all of you are here. Nobody does it alone Jack. You needed all of them, and they needed you.
1726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	For what?
1728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	To remember...and to...let go.
1730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate...she said we were leaving.
1732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Not leaving, no. Moving on.
1734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are we going?
1736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	[smiling] Let's go find out.
1738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack nods and they enter the church. Everyone else is already here, greeting each other. On the Island, Jack walks through the jungle holding his wound. At the church, Jack is greeted by Locke.]
1740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We've been waiting for you.
1742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack greets Desmond and Penny, shaking Desmond's hand. He hugs Boone. On the Island, he stumbles through the bamboo forest, passing the white tennis shoe that once belonged to his father's corpse, now worn and dirty after 3 years exposed to the weather. At the church, he hugs Hurley. Claire, Charlie, Sun, Shannon and Sayid all gather around Aaron. Jack greets Sawyer before noticing Kate, and she holds his hand as they sit down in the pews. On the Island, Jack comes to the spot where he woke up from the crash and collapses to the ground, still clutching at his wound. At the church, everyone else sits down. Christian puts his hand on Jack's shoulder as he passes by. On the Island, Jack is laying on his back on the ground when he hears a dog bark - it's Vincent. Vincent greets him and then lays beside him. At the church, Christian walks down the aisle and opens the doors, leaving and letting a bright white light fill the room. Everyone gazes at their surroundings, Jack and Kate share a glance. On the Island, a dying Jack witnesses the Ajira plane fly over head. He smiles, knowing he isn't going to die for nothing. At the church, Jack is swallowed by the white light. On the Island, Jack's eye closes. He is gone. The end.]
