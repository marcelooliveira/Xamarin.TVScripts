The Greater Good
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Leonard Dick
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	David Grossman
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid looking at Shannon sitting at Boone's body. He sits next to her.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Is there anything I can do for you? Sun said he wouldn't let Jack take his leg -- he didn't want him using up the antibiotics. She said he knew what was happening to him -- that he was brave.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid at Heathrow airport in handcuffs being escorted by two guards to a room with intelligence agents from CIA and ASIS.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT	[while Sayid is being led by the guards] Heathrow airport authority reminds traveling passengers that safety regulations require...
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	Okay, Sayid, 18 hours in a holding cell should be enough. Let's get to it, shall we? I'm Melissa Cole from Central Intelligence, this is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS. We're here because you're going to do us a favor.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A favor?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	Last week 300 pounds of C-4 explosives were stolen from an army base outside of Melbourne. The men responsible are members of a terrorist cell intent on disrupting the coalition presence in Iraq. 300 pounds of C-4 - I want it back.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to Agent Cole] You're the CIA, plant a few bugs.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	Oh, we have. But you're going to get inside for us.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I am Iraqi. I am not a terrorist.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	We didn't snatch you up because you are a terrorist, Sayid. We snatched you up because you know one.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	Essam Tasir, your roommate at Cairo University. He's a member of the cell.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And why should I care?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	You'd be saving lives.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I repeat, why should I care?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	Because we know where she is. 7 years since you left Iraq -- 6 months here, 3 months there -- always moving. There's only two reasons a man would do that, Sayid. Either he's running away from something, or looking for something. [she shows Sayid a picture of Nadia] Noor Abed-Jazeem.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Nobody calls her Noor.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	You want to know where she is? Then we're going to Sydney.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of Kate walking slowly through the jungle. She finds a strip of white fabric and then hears Jack approaching.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate? What are you doing out here?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Looking for you.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, you found me.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're walking in circles. You need to come back.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not without Locke.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You haven't slept. You gave Boone your own blood.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke lied.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Well, now you're-
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He lied, Kate. Boone did not fall off any cliff. His leg was crushed, and I based my medical treatment on his lie.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	People are scared and upset. They don't know what's going on. We need you to come back, Jack. Please.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley and Jack carrying Boone's body to the burial site, regulars and redshirts in tow.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Shannon? Do you want to say something?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	No.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Long pause.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I didn't know Boone very well, and for that I am sorry. On our 6th day here a woman named Joanna died. She drowned. And Boone was the first one into the water. I didn't know him, but I remember his courage. And I know he will be missed.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[off camera] It was my fault. We found a plane, a Beechcraft, in the jungle. It was lodged in the canopy so -- I would have gone up, but I -- my leg was hurt so he -- there was a radio inside and he thought he could -- look, his weight must have made the plane shift and it fell -- and -- it happened because he was trying to help us. He was a hero.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where were you? Where were you? Where the hell were you, you son of a bitch?! [Jack runs at Locke and tackles him] What did you do to him?!
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Sawyer pull Jack off of Locke.]
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, wait, wait, Jack!
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where were you?! You left him to die! You lied to me! Where were you?!
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We return to scene on the beach. Charlie, Sawyer, and Kate are holding Jack back.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Jack, okay, it's okay.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where were you?! Where were you?!
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack! Jack, what's the matter? Are you okay? Are you okay?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack collapses.]
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Get some water!
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Breathe. He's okay. Just breathe, Jack.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Sayid walking through the beach camp. Kate and Sun behind.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's lying.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're suffering from fatigue.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke told Boone not to tell.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Tell about what?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Something about a hatch. Locke's hiding something.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack, lis-
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, the man is hiding something.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack, listen to me. What we need is for the one doctor on this Island to get some sleep.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm fine. I don't need it.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	You need some rest. C'mon.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid in a Mosque praying. Shot of Essam looking at Sayid and whispering to the guy next to him. Sayid walks out.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	[outside the Mosque] Sayid! Sayid, it is you.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Essam.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	I see you haven't forgotten me.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They embrace in greeting.]
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Hardly.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	What are you doing in Sydney?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I've been traveling, and you?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	I live here -- almost a year now -- I'm a tree-cutter. I cut trees.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It sounds like good, honest work.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	So much for my philosophy degree, huh?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Whatever puts food on your table. How is Zahra?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	She died -- stray bomb while she was shopping for a dress.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm so sorry.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Listen, listen, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Why don't you come over?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'd love to.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a Half Life video game being played in the apartment of Essam. Essam brings Sayid some tea, while two other guys (Yusef and Haddad) play video games.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YUSEF	Damn it. I'm out of ammo.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	Use the crowbar.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YUSEF	That only works on the zombies, not the big bugs.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	Indeed.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The 3 of you live here?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Sydney's very expensive. This is the best we can afford.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	And what is it you do, Sayid?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	At the moment I'm at liberty.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	He's on holiday. You'll love the beaches here. There's something to be said for Australian women.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid notices a smoke detector.]
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[while walking to the smoke detector] I've had the misfortune of being landlocked for several years. The last beach I was at was Sharm-el Sheikh with you Essam -- remember, before our English exams? [Sayid holds a cigarette to the smoke detector which doesn't go off] I hear the beaches here are very nice, especially the women. [he pulls a bugging device out of the smoke detector] Perhaps we can go. [he puts the bug in a glass with liquid] So tell me exactly what kind of trees do you cut?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	Who are you?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I was a communications officer.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Sayid was Republican Guard. He knows things.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	Perhaps it's not happenstance that you and Essam met at the Mosque. Perhaps it is fate.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Claire at the beach with the baby.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	It's okay. Look, I'm fine, really, okay?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You need rest, Claire. Sun, tell her.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	In a hospital they would have you sleep. The nurses would take your baby.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, but I'm not in a hospital.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, all the more reason to take extra care, Claire. Look, it's okay, I can take care of turnip-head for a while.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Turnip-head?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's just what I'm calling him until you give him a name because his head -- it's like a turnip.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What if he needs something, okay?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You'll be there for him -- after you sleep.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No, okay? No.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire, no one is going to take this baby away from you. No one.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You don't know that, okay. You can't say that.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I won't let anything happen.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[handing the baby over] Just be really careful, okay? Make sure if he gets hot that you take his blanket off -- his neck, okay, got his neck?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Got it.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Shannon sitting alone on the beach. Locke enters and sets down Boone's knapsack.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	This was his. I didn't go through it.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Thank you.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Welcome. Storm coming. I should have said no -- the first time he offered to hunt with me I should have said no.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	He would have gone anyway.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, I suppose he would have. I know how confused and angry you must be right now. I can't say I understand what you're going through, but I know what it feels like when you lose family. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sorry.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke exits. Shannon looks after him with tears in her eyes.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid working on a piece of electronic equipment.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You asked if you could do anything for me.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Anything.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	John Locke killed my brother. Will you do something about that?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Kate at a tent on the beach. Jack is drinking something which he tries to give to Kate.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Little more.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You need to get your blood sugar level up.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, enough already. I've rested. [Jack tries to get up.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm fine.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where are you going?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going to go talk to Locke.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You need to lie down.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I don't.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I strongly advise it.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Advise? [Jack is disoriented and lies back] Advice -- alright, what's going on now?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Lie down, okay. I crushed up some sleeping pills -- put them in your juice.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why would you -- you drugged me?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, okay.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack becomes unconscious.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Night.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke cleaning out his blood soaked shirt at the caves. Walt walks by and Locke waves, but Walt keeps walking. Sayid enters.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you get that? [Referring to a scar on Locke's back.]
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	War wound.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Looks more like a surgical scar.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Like I said, war wound.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The plane's radio? Was Boone able to pick up a signal?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I was on the ground, all I could here was static.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	But it was working?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, but I can't imagine it survived the fall.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Some of its parts might work in the transmitter I'm building for the raft. If you'd be willing to take me?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Of course.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke and Sayid walking in the jungle.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How did you find this plane?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Luck.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You and Boone were hunting.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Was that a question?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The boar got scarce a couple of weeks back. We weren't hunting, we were exploring.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	So you just happened upon a Beechcraft perched in the trees?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yep.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	At the funeral you said your leg was injured.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It was just a charlie-horse. A cramp.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I know what a charlie-horse is, John.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Back in Iraq you were an interrogator.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Is that a question?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A long time ago I was.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, you haven't lost your touch.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why would I interrogate you, John?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack called me a liar in front of every man, woman and child I've come to know over the past month. Maybe there's a part of you that thinks maybe there isn't a plane out here at all.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I know when I'm being lied to. There's a plane.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They come upon the plane.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Like I said, you haven't lost your touch.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid and Essam playing soccer in a park.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You've lost your edge, old man.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	I never had one when playing against you.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Were you always this slow?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	C'mon, c'mon, let's keep playing.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You have to get out of that apartment -- practice more.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Haddad would like that -- more blending in with the community.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I think he's got his eye on a target.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	What makes you say that?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	For the last 2 weeks he's been asking me about explosives -- blast radius, transport.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Haddad's very thorough.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Do you know if he's gotten hold of any yet?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Explosives? I don't know. All I know is there's going to be an operation -- and there is going to be a martyr.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Haddad told me this morning. C'mon let's keep playing. C'mon -- I'll wipe the floor with you.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Essam, what is it, huh? What is it?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	I don't think I can do it.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid at a dock with Agents Cole and Hewitt.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	You're kidding me, right?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Listen to me, I can get Essam to turn himself in. He wants out.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	Does he know where the C-4 is?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The other two are the one's you want. Essam's confused-
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	Does he know where it is?
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	Then he's useless. These cells run top down. It's all need-to-know. The recruit's handed a bomb and target at the last possible moment. The only way to find that C-4 is to wait for Essam to walk out that door with a target to hit.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He's in over his head. He doesn't even know why he's doing it...
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	That's why you're going to convince him to go through with it.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No. No, I will not.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	Excuse me?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm done. It's over.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	No, no, you're not even close to being done, my friend.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you going to do? Arrest me?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	No, we'll arrest her. Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency. Wouldn't it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant, Sayid? So, if you want any chance of ever seeing her again you're going to go and talk your good friend Essam into blowing himself up.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Charlie walking the beach with a crying baby.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the spout, down came the rain and drowned the spider out...
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, it's washed -- washed the spider out. Unless it's some kind of British version?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, okay. Down came the rain and washed the spider -- oh, bollocks, shhhh, shhh, shhh.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's the matter, man?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, I can't get the bloody thing to stop crying.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Maybe it's hungry?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Nope, Claire nursed him 5 times.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Any deposits? You know, diaper-wise?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie sniffs the baby and shakes his head.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Alright, it's time to break out the big guns. [Hurley starts singing I Got You (I Feel Good) but the baby keeps crying] Dude, that's all I got.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[See see Sayid and Locke at the plane.]
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[tasting the stuff in the baggies] Heroin.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The cargo hold's full of it. The best I can figure it -- they were smugglers.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The plane was perched in the canopy?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Right up there.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And Boone climbed up by himself because of your charlie-horse?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes, that's right.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why did you lie?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I made a mistake.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm going to salvage what I can of the radio. If we leave now we should beat the storm back.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why don't you trust me, Sayid?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	For one thing, you've been carrying a gun you've told no one about.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[taking the gun out of his pocket and giving it to Sayid] We found one of the smugglers about a half a click West of here dressed as a priest -- Nigerian currency in his pockets, and this. Now you're armed and I'm not. Does that earn me any trust?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You gave this to me because I caught you concealing it. That earns you adaptability.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Okay, I'll tell you something you don't know.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Please do.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The first week after the crash there was a cave in. Jack was trapped. Do you remember that?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Of course.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You, Kate and Sawyer went out into the jungle to try and triangulate a signal.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Yes.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You were hit from behind -- knocked unconscious? When you woke up your transceiver, your equipment was destroyed. That was me.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid grabs Locke by the neck and puts the gun to his throat.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This is one time you'd better not be telling the truth.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I did what was in everyone's best interest.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You ruined my chance to find the source.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The source of a distress call that kept saying they're dead, it killed them all, over and over? Is that a place you really want to lead people to?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why wait all this time? Why not tell me then?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because back then you wouldn't have engaged in reasonable debate, and nobody else would have. You were all so focused on getting off the Island that you weren't seeing things clearly. It's like what's happening now with the raft.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Did you burn the raft, John?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, Sayid, I didn't.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What is the hatch?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The hatch?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Boone mentioned it before he died.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	A hatch? Two hatches on a plane, Sayid, could be forward or aft.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid lowers the gun.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid and Essam walking in Sydney.]
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	I'm not sure if I can do this.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You would not be a martyr if you didn't have to overcome fear, Essam.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	I'm not afraid to die. It's all the innocent lives -- all those people. The Imam preaches peace, Sayid. Every human life is sacred.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's true, innocent lives will be lost -- in service of a greater good.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	What if I'm doing this because I'm angry? What if I'm doing this because they killed her?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What if you are? Should we just accept what happened to Zahra? Do we just accept their deaths? Because if we do, it means that ultimately we can do nothing about them. I lost someone, too, Essam. I will never be whole again. There need to be consequences for those responsible. That's my duty. That is how I will honor her.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Haddad was right, it was fate that brought us back together. Sayid, will you do this with me?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I will.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Shannon looking through Boone's knapsack -- she finds a picture of her and Boone. Sayid enters.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How are you? Do you want to take a walk?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Sure.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I spoke to Locke.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What did he say?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He took me to the plane. I believe what happened was an accident.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Then why did he lie?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I have no idea. But I don't believe he meant to harm Boone.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	So that's it?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	You don't get it, do you?
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Shannon.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Just forget about it, okay?
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael, Walt and Jin at the raft.]
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	How much weight can this hold?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I don't know. A lot. Enough.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	ÃªÂ·Â¸ÃªÂ±Â°... Ã¬Â¡Â°Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã¬Â¤ËœÃ¬Å¡â€.

556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What if it tips over?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It won't. That's why we made it this wide. There, that should do it. Right? Good?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Good.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Alright.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What if a shark attacks?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	A shark's not getting anywhere near us, man.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What if we die?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We are not going to die.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Boone died.

578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, I tried that. Hey, Jin, have you seen Sun?

586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[entering] Hey, Chuckie, want to keep that kid quiet? Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[the baby is quiet] Oh, there you go. You happy now? [the baby starts crying]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I was. If you're going to play nursemaid, at least do the damn job. [the baby quiets at the sound of Sawyer's voice]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, say something else. Just say something, say anything.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, fine. I liked that thing a lot better inside than I like it outside.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer starts walking away and Charlie follows.]
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack wake up with Kate by his side.]

606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's in it, chloroform?
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Soup.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thanks, but I think I'll -- [Jack notices the key to the gun case is missing] Who was in here?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't know, what's the matter...
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Was anybody in here?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, why are you...
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The key to the gun case, it's gone.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Jack walking, they come upon Sayid.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Maybe it fell off this morning.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It didn't fall off.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What's going on?
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke took the key -- he's after the guns.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I haven't seen him all day, you don't know that...
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, then who was it?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Jack, it wasn't Locke.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Shannon in the rain getting a gun from the case.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Sayid coming out of a door. A van with Haddad and Essam pulls up.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	Sayid, get in. It's time.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The van pulls into a warehouse type location and Haddad moves to open the back of a truck filled with explosives.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HADDAD	Stay relaxed and focused; drive with the windows down -- the fresh air will keep you alert. You will need to wear these [handing them uniform-type jackets]. If you run into any problems use this [handing Essam a gun]. You are heroes. Good luck.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Haddad exits. Essam prays and starts the truck.]
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Essam stop.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Don't be nervous, brother. We'll be okay.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm working with the CIA.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	What?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm going to give you 10 minutes to get away before I call them.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	You set me up?
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Essam, just go.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Why would you do this to me?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're wasting time.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	You said we were going to do this together. You said you lost someone.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Her name is Nadia. We were separated years ago. They know where I can find her.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	You used me to find a woman? [Essam puts the gun to Sayid's throat] You talked me into this.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Essam, don't.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	You said it was for the greater good.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm begging you to go.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	You said you were my brother. You were supposed to be my brother, my friend.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I am your friend.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	A friend who told me to do this for Zahra just so you could find some woman that you love?!
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Essam is about to shoot Sayid, but stops.]
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ESSAM	Well, then, Sayid, I hope she makes you whole again.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Essam!
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Essam shoots himself.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Sayid, Jack and Kate running through the jungle in the rain. Jack stops and kneels, feeling sick. Kate stops.]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Go! Go.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate helps Jack up. Sayid continues running until he finds Shannon holding a gun on Locke.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	She doesn't believe me, Sayid.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Shannon, Shannon, please listen to me.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	He did it. I know it.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're not thinking rationally. You've never fired a gun before.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon fires the gun between Locke and Sayid.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Shannon, you don't want to do this.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yes, I do!
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If you do it, you can never take it back.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Kate enter.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Stay back! What did you do to him?!
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I told you it was an accident.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Shannon.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Jack, you told me he was a liar!
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon fires as Sayid tackles her. Locke falls.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm sorry.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Don't. Get away.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Shannon.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate runs after Shannon. Locke sits up with a bullet graze on his forehead. Jack looks disgusted and exits.]
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sawyer sitting with Charlie and the baby.]
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[reading from a magazine] The low rumble breaks the crisp fall air as a flash of red streaks down the maple-dappled Vermont highway. [he stops and the baby starts fussing] The 32 valve V-8 engine purrs as the transmission clicks down a gear and the vehicle unleashes all 400 horses and 350 pound feet rear-wheel torque.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire approaches. The baby starts to cry.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to Sawyer] Keep going. Keep going.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Charlie.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie shushes Claire and motions into the shelter.]
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Beneath the hood the 4.4 liter power plant features a fully integrated super-charger made into a 6 speed transmission from the manual sequential shift feature.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Keep going.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	This smooth-riding sports car offers a bewitching blend of taste, comfort and economy.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid looking at Shannon sitting alone at the beach by a fire. Kate enters.]
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She just needs time. She's been through a lot.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Time won't make a difference. Perhaps I made a mistake.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You couldn't let her kill Locke. You had no choice.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	There's always a choice.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Essam's body being wheeled away.]
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	She lives in Irvine, California, just south of Los Angeles -- works as a lab-tech at a medical testing company -- plane ticket, walking around money, you're on an Oceanic flight to LA. It leaves in two hours.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What happens to his body?
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT COLE	He was a terrorist so he's not exactly getting a state funeral.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What happens to his body?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	After it's released; he'll be cremated.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	A Muslim man is supposed to be buried.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	Yeah, well, there's no one to claim the body.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'll claim him.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	AGENT HEWITT	You can't claim him when you're on a plane in 2 hours, mate.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Then change my flight to tomorrow. [The agents nod in agreement.]
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke at a fire putting a salve on his wounded forehead.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How's your head?
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It'll heal.
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Another war wound.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I know what it cost you to do what you did. Thank you.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I did it because I sense you might be our best hope of surviving here. But I don't forgive what you did. And I certainly don't trust you. And now, you're going to take me to the hatch.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hatch? -- I already showed you the...
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	John, no more lies.
