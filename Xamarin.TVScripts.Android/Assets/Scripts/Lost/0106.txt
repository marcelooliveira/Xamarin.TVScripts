240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This is the most crap idea ever. It's never going to work.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Now, pull yourself together, son.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It wouldn't be an irrational fear of bees if I could just pull myself together, would it?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack with a suitcase, getting ready to cover the hive. Charlie smacks on bee on his face, gets off balance and steps on the hive breaking it open. They all take off running. Jack and Kate to the caves. Locke and Charlie in the other direction. Jack and Kate take their shirts off. Kate ends up right by one of the skeletons and sees it. She's frightened and backs away. We see the skeleton.]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of skeleton.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Who is he. How'd he get here?
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I can't exactly perform an autopsy but there doesn't seem to be any major trauma to the bones. There's another one over here. Someone laid them to rest here.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Who?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where would they come from?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where'd that come from?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Any idea how long they've been here?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Long. It takes 40 or 50 years for clothing to degrade like this.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack finds a pouch in the clothing.]
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What is it?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack dumps a white stone and a black stone into his palm.]

278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[nodding] A few stings aside.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack puts the stones back into the pouch, but we can't see what he does with the pouch.]
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You two run away fantastically. Glad my diversion spared you. I was only stung several hundred times. Oh, and uh, someone left this [handing Kate her shirt].
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It was, um, it was full of bees.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'd have thought C's, actually.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gives him a "you're an idiot" look.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sort of laughs. Then Charlie sees one of the skeletons. Jack is looking at the other one.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Bloody Hell! Are these the people who were here before us?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks toward Locke. Locke comes closer.]

306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Clearly. But, who were these men?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Actually, one of them is female.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Our very own Adam and Eve.

340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We should move out. People are probably getting thirsty. [She sees Jack looking at the spring] What?
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	46 people need to drink a half gallon a day each. Carrying all this water back and forth is going to be real pain in the ass.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're starting to make me regret volunteering.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	These caves make too good a shelter just to be used for burial. Adam and Eve, they must have lived here. Their plane crashed, or maybe they were ship-wrecked. They probably found this place and knew they could survive here. Unlimited supply of fresh water, tree canopy keeps the temperature down, shields out the sun, [Kate is looking down, unconvinced], the openings are narrow, easier for protection against predators. We don't need to bring the water to the people. We need to bring the people to the water. [Kate still looking unconvinced]. I think we could live here.

358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	You said people like him don't like people like us.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oh man. You know, uh, look, that's not true, and you know what, I don't think like that anyway. I was, I was angry.

366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What did I do to him? You tell me? I've been with you since we crashed. Have you seen me do anything, to anyone? What kind of man do you think I am, anyway? What did your mother say about me?

462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Undamaged? Still playable? I don't think so. I mean, I wish, but there was this bloke at the counter made me check it in.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. There wasn't enough room in the cabin, fascist.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You'll see it again.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh yeah? What makes you say that?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because I have faith, Charlie.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack and Kate walking. They come across Sayid chopping wood.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's about time. I am dying of thirst.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Kate, Sayid are sitting down drinking some water.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I think I'll let him sit in the sun a while longer. Then I'll take his wife aside, find some way to communicate. I think she knows why he attacked Michael.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're sure you don't want me to talk to her? [Sayid nods.] Okay. If you've got that under control I'm going to start talking to people about the caves. Might be able to get a few to go with me before nightfall, start setting up camp.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're serious? Is there a reason you didn't consult us when you decided to form your own civilization?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm only talking about moving into the valley.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Well, what happened to live together, die alone?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Digging in together is the only way we're going to survive.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Our best hope of survival is in being spotted by a plane or a ship, and for that we need to organize everyone to keep that signal fire burning while others scout the Island for supplies. Digging in anywhere else is suicide!
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It is the only source of fresh water we've found, Sayid.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And staying on the beach, in the sun without water? That's not suicide?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[grabbing his firewood and axe] I'm not going to admit defeat.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks at Jack as Jack watches Sayid walk away.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Walt playing with Vincent on the beach as Michael watches. Jack is talking to people to convince them to go to the caves. Sayid approaches Michael.]
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Now what? I already gave you my statement, sheriff.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I came to apologize. I shouldn't have been suspicious. You were the victim in the attack this morning.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I appreciate that, but I can tell you didn't come all the way over here just to say you're sorry.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	People are seriously considering following Jack to the caves. I'd like to know where you stand.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Right here. I've got one priority right now and that's to get my kid off this Island. A boat passes, I'm not going to be on the hook for missing it.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Good.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack brings some water to Jin.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Slowly, just a little bit at a time, little bit.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[approaching Hurley] Glad you're coming.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey man, I go where the boar's at. So, what's up with you and Kate? You guys going to move into a cave together, or what?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry, am I in high school?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, that wasn't a denial.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just get your stuff together, we've got to get out of here soon.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[approaching Kate] Well, well, well, if ain't the belle of the ball? So what's it like having both the doctor and Captain Falafel fighting over you? [Kate doesn't respond] Just call 'em how I seem 'em, Freckles. Truth be told, I'm not the only one wondering where you're going to weigh in on this whole moving off the beach thing. Are you going with the pessimists, or staying here and waiting for the rescue boats?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you going?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? We all pack up stakes for the caves and the next day a plane passes by, they're going to go on their merry way and be none the wiser. On the other hand, stay here, get eaten by boars, fall off a rock, not going to be anyone around to answer that 911 call.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Still haven't answered my question.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You didn't answer mine. And I asked first.
