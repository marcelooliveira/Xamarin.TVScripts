6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a boy arrange some tools on the ground near a car up on blocks. He opens the hood, and we see a man, David, approach carrying a duffel bag.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	You got that thing running yet, buddy?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG HURLEY	Naw, but I got your tools all set.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Let's see if we can get this thing started, okay?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG HURLEY	I thought we needed a new carburetor?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Well, maybe we don't. Come on, slide behind the wheel. Let's fire this up.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They get in and he hands the keys to a reluctant Hurley.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	What's the matter? Go ahead.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley closes his eyes and silently prays as he puts the key in the ignition. He turns the key, but it doesn't start.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG HURLEY	It's stupid. Without a new carburetor it's not going to work.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Having hope is never stupid. You've got to believe good things will happen and then they will. You understand what I'm saying? [Hurley nods] In this world, son, you've got to make your own luck. Alright, come on.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG HURLEY	[getting out of the car] Well, what do you want to fix today?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[sighing] We're going to have to put that on hold for a little while because, um, I've got to go to Vegas. You know, I've got some work out there.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG HURLEY	What about the road trip?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	The Grand Canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude. Hey, I've got something for you. [he hands him a candy bar]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG HURLEY	Um, I'm not supposed to, mom says.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Live a little, Hugo. It's just a candy bar. [he grabs his duffel bag] Alright, I'll be back before you know it. Hold down the fort? You're my man? Alright.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley starts eating the candy bar while watching his father ride away on his motorcycle. Hurley's mom watches from a window.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Hurley looking sad.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So then, the Others take the bags off our heads and we're, like, on the other side of the island. And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away. Which I did. And now everyone's freaked out. With them gone -- and what happened to Eko -- they're all scared. And I'm scared. But then, I've been scared most of my time here anyway, except when I'm with you. I miss you, Libby.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley places a flower at Libby's grave.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie is on the beach shaving. He accidently cuts himself.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Bloody hell.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, you okay?
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Peachy.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Really? Because you've kind of been moping...
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Look, it's not worth talking about, Hurley. Okay?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You can tell me anything.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Desmond told me I was going to die. He told me has these flashes -- visions, whatever -- and in them I always die. [Hurley doesn't respond] So this is the part where you tell me it is ridiculous, don't be daft, he's a nutter.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I think he might be right. And I think it might be my fault.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Your fault?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm kind of cursed. Death finds me, dude.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly Vincent runs up carrying a mummified arm in his jaws. A key and rabbit's foot dangle from the hand.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Vincent? Is that an arm?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Here, Vincent. Come here. [to Charlie] I think we need to get that.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. You be my guest.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, if I'm not back in 3 hours tell somebody.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley takes off running after Vincent.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Vincent! Vincent, come here. Vincent.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley stops. Vincent shows up, drops the arm at his feet, and takes off again. Hurley grabs the key, and Vincent barks getting Hurley to follow. Hurley comes upon an old VW van turned on its side and overgrown with plants.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Awesome.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Hurley is being interviewed by a news crew outside a Mr. Clucks.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRICIA	It's everyone's fantasy -- winning the lottery -- untold millions falling into your lap overnight. What would you do with all that money? Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Reyes, winner of a record 140 million dollars, outside Mr. Clucks Chicken in Diamond Bar which will be having its grand re-opening tomorrow. So, Hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is: why did you buy Mr. Clucks?
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[nervous] Uh, I like chicken.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRICIA	Um, also with us is Hugo's former boss, and now employee, Randy Nation. That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes? [Hurley just shrugs] Um, okay, so, Hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend, Starla. Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRICIA	Cut! [to Hurley] What the hell was that?! It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes, do you know what that is?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah. Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRICIA	Um, do you mind if we go inside and shoot some B-roll?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, I don't know.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can. He's just superstitious. You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRICIA	[to cameraman] Okay, let's go. Ugh, god I hate this. [voice fades] I always get the stupid stories...
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Randy] Hey, you sure it's okay?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	Yeah, relax.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	The safety guards are on the fryers?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	Those fryers are stone cold, alright? We don't even start cooking until tomorrow.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Do you hear something?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear a sound like a missile in the background. Cut to Tricia and cameraman inside.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TRICIA	And then pan through the...
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She stops when she hears the sound. Hurley and Randy look up in disbelief as a meteor crashes into the restaurant.]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley examines the van and finds the body the arm belonged to. It's wearing a DHARMA jumpsuit with Swan logo. Written under the logo is: Roger; and on a second line: Work Man.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Paulo and others are at the beach "kitchen."]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Well, we are out of DHARMA Oat Bars.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Already?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Yep.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	Did you check behind the powdered milk?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Yes, it's not there.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Camera pans to Sun and Jin at the table.]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Will you pass me the box of cereal? [Jin looks confused] Will you pass me the box of cereal?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â¬Â´Ã¬Å Â¨ Ã«Â§ÂÃ¬Ââ€ž Ã­â€¢ËœÃ«Å â€Ã¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«ÂªÂ¨Ã«Â¥Â´ÃªÂ²Â Ã¬â€“Â´.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	From now on I will only speak to you in English. It's how you will learn.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢â€ž, Ã¬â„¢Å“ Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Å¾Ëœ.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	It will be hard at first.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[annoyed] Ã¬â€¹Â«Ã«â€¹Â¤Ã«â€¹Ë†ÃªÂ¹Å’?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley runs into camp and is quite winded.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! Hey! Hey everyone! Hey!!
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hurley, what is it?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Is it the Others?
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hurley, are you okay?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	What's going on man?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[triumphantly] Car! I found a car tipped over in the jungle.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIKKI	You found a car?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And we could totally fix it and get it going again. It's not far, come on.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Why do we need to start a car?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Because it'll be fun. [everyone looks sort of embarrassed for Hurley] We could all use some fun. I mean, after everything's that happened we need it. [he looks at Charlie] Especially you, dude. So who's with me?!!
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PAULO	Well, I've got to cut some bananas. Sorry.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't think so, Hurley.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Come on. Anyone. We're going to drive it! Who's coming?!
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone walks away except Jin. Hurley walks over and puts a hand on his shoulder.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Thanks, dude. [Hurley laughs] You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you? [Jin laughs] Come on.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Sawyer are walking in the jungle.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Are we there yet?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	If we are where I think we are then our beach should be just through those trees. We'll be home in about 5 minutes.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Try to contain your excitement, Freckles.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. In fact, I'd be surprised if Locke-- [Sawyer steps on a dart] Ow, ow, ow.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What happened?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I stepped on something. Son-of-a-bitch!
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Looks like a dart.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How the hell did it get out here?
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Alright, just relax your foot for a second, okay? I'm going to pull it out. On the count of 3. Ready? 1 -- [she pulls it out].
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ow!!! I thought you said "3"?
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. I thought I would spare you. [she sits next to him and they share a long look] You know, all you have to do is say sorry. You could start again -- give each other a clean slate.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[sighing] Slate. Like on Little House?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Little House on the Prairie? Laura Ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[laughing] You call it Little House?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I had mono when I was a kid -- missed 2 months of school -- we only got one channel in my trailer.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are we even talking about?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[quietly] We ain't talking about nothing. [he starts to exit]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	James?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So that's how it's going to be? Welcome home, Sawyer. [she walks off]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Welcome home, Kate.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Scene switches to Kate and Sawyer arriving at the beach and everyone happily greeting them, even as they keep their distance from each other.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Hurley, still covered in dust from the Mr. Clucks disaster. He enters a huge formal home as his mother, Carmen, calls to him.]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Hugo! Hugo, is that you? Oh my god, what happened?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Tricia Tanaka is dead.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	What?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Mr. Clucks got hit by a meteor, or an asteroid. I don't know the difference but it's gone.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	That's crazy.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not crazy. It's the lottery money, the numbers, I'm cursed. And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault. [Carmen slaps him hard across the face] Ow!!
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	It was an accident.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. I have to go to Australia.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Again with Australia.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's where the numbers came from. Lenny, in the institution, he told me.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Hugo, Hugo wait. I can prove to you you're not cursed.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You can?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Yes. Come here with me. I have to show you something.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She leads him away and we see his father, David, enter.]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hey, Hugo!
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	After 17 years your father has returned.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	[sizing Hurley up] Hey, your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars. [he laughs] Just kidding.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley and Jin look at Roger in the van.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Poor, Roger. Sorry about your arm, dude.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[at the back of the van] Hurley! Ã¬ÂÂ´ÃªÂ²Æ’ Ã«Â´Â. In, In.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Totally. Let's check it out. [he opens the back of the van]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside there's a pile of DHARMA beer.]
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, Roger was on a beer run.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[gesturing at the van] Ã¬â€¹Å“Ã¬Â²Â´ ÃªÂºÂ¼Ã«â€šÂ´Ã¬Å¾Â.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I suck at charades. You want to what?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[gesturing] Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«Æ’Â, Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«Æ’Â.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, you want to take Roger out? [Jin continues gesturing] And turn it over. [yelling to Jin] I understand!
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jin position themselves so they can take Roger out of the van.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, on 3. 1-2-3.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They pull him out, but his skull breaks off in the process.]
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We'll get that later.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond is arranging his tarp. Charlie approaches.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, when's it going to happen?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	When's what going to happen?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Don't play stupid with me, brother.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I was drunk. Now if I said anything...
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I have a right to when I'm going to die.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It doesn't work like that.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What doesn't work like that?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[entering] Hey, Oliver Twist, where the hell's my stuff?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What stuff?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff! I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You drank it?!
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well, to be fair there was -- there was 3 of us.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, there was.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You, the Munchkin, and who else?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jin are in the jungle with long poles to use as levers to tip the van.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[placing his pole under the van] Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Â â€¡ÃªÂ²Å’, Ã¬Ââ€˜? Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Â â€¡ÃªÂ²Å’.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, I got it. You're going to tip it up. Crafty.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Crafty?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, crafty. It's like, when you're good at ... crafts. Nevermind.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[entering] Hey, where the hell's my stuff? [he notices the van] What are you all doing?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[running to hug him] Dude! You're alive!! You're alive.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[chuckling] Yeah, yeah, Snuffy. Good to see you, too. I'll be damned, you all found yourselves a hippy car.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Pretty cool, huh?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[reaching for a hug] Sawyer.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jin-bo. How are you going?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Good see you.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, look at that. Somebody's hooked on phonics.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What about Jack and Kate? Are they with you? Are they alright?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Kate's with me, but the Doc -- they've still got him.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay. It's okay. It's going to be alright. Jack's going to be alright. We all are.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, what a relief.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Naw, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely -- it's a sign.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh-uh. You're going to help us fix this thing.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now why would I do that?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Because there's beer.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Sayid and Kate are walking on the beach.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why did he say "don't come back?"
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He sacrificed himself so we could escape. He probably didn't want it to be for nothing.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Hurley told us they released Michael and Walt.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yep. They gave Michael a boat. He took off and never looked back.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Did you see any other boats?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So they can leave the island?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't know, John.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This zoo where they held you, is that where they live?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[shaking her head] We escaped with one of them -- a kid named Karl -- he says that they live on this island. He could have taken us there but Sawyer let him go.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Why?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're going to have to ask Sawyer. [she starts to walk off]
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Kate, where are you going?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I don't care what Jack said. They've got him and we've got to get him back. I owe him that. I'm going to get help.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Help from who?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a close-up of a golden statuette of Jesus. The camera pulls back to reveal the Reyes family at the dinner table being served by two butlers.]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Now, that's a hell of a Jesus.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Yes, Hugo's such a good son. He knows of my love for the savior, so he commissioned artisans in Taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Ah, that smells like great lasagna.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	The Tranhs made it themselves. Hugo found them in Bennigans. Now they are our butlers.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley is just sitting dejectedly, staring at his plate.]
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Something wrong, Hugo?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Your father asked you a question, Hugo.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	My father? You're acting like he never left us -- like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all the sudden he shows up? Are you at least a little suspicious?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?!
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	All those numbers and curses. Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore. I thought you needed a manly influence, a father, to get you stop this nonsense.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not crazy. And the only reason he's back is because he wants the money.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Well, now that hurts.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, guess what? There isn't going to be any money. Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh? Your services will no longer be needed. [he tosses a wad of money toward them] Severance. Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you die, or worse.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Hugo, what are you doing?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Getting rid of it. All of it -- the money, the houses, the livestock -- and I'm starting with him.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	No, Hugo. Your father is staying with us.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He's staying with us? Where?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	It's been 17 years, Hugo.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's been 17 years?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	I have needs.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[covering his ears and yelling] No! No! No! This can't be happening. He has to go! He has to. I want him gone!
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	No you don't.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I do.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Why don't you go show your father what you have in the garage? Hugo?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and David in the garage with the old Camaro.]
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I can't believe it. You saved it. You saved it.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley, Jin and Sawyer tip the van up. Sawyer opens the side door, and Vincent butts in.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Vincent] Me first, now, come on.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a shot of a large pile of crumpled papers.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell is up with all this recycling?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You got me, dude.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin opens the engine compartment. Sawyer finds a map.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Looks like those DHARMA freaks were building some sort of dirt road. [he sees the beer] Woo, now we're talking.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[looking at the engine overgrown with ivy] Ã¬ÂÂ´ÃªÂ±Â° ÃªÂ³Â Ã¬Â¹ËœÃ«Â Â¤Ã«Â©Â´ Ã¬â€¹Å“ÃªÂ°â€ž Ã«Â§Å½Ã¬ÂÂ´ ÃªÂ±Â¸Ã«Â¦Â¬ÃªÂ²Â Ã«Å â€Ã«ÂÂ°?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[surprised] Son-of-a -- what's a head doing back here?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, that's just Roger. [loudly to Jin] I'm going to start the car now.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«â€¹Ë†, Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Â§Â Ã­â€¢ËœÃ¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«Â§Ë†. Ã¬â€”â€Ã¬Â§â€žÃ«Â¶â‚¬Ã­â€žÂ° Ã«Â¨Â¼Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã­â„¢â€¢Ã¬ÂÂ¸Ã­â€¢Â´Ã¬â€¢Â¼Ã¬Â§â‚¬.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, even if you were speaking English, I wouldn't understand a word you were saying. Just relax; we're good. This'll work.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs the beer out of the van, as Hurley gets into the driver's seat.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I have hope. This will work.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He closes his eyes and turns the key, but nothing happens.]
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[softly] Damn it.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer opens a beer. Jin is working on the engine in the background with Hurley standing over him.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[smelling the beer] Hoh, it's flat and it stinks.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Jin] Can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Chill out; let the man do his thing.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before Rocky III, maybe even II. It's probably poison by now.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[pointing at Roger] Skeletor seems to like it. [Sawyer clinks the beer can on Roger's skull] Bottoms up.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family, and friends. Oh, and a name, it's not skeletor, it's Roger Workman.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's Work Man, you blockhead. That's his job. He was a DHARMA janitor.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â°Â°Ã­â€žÂ°Ã«Â¦Â¬ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬â„¢â€žÃ¬Â â€žÃ­Å¾Ë† Ã¬Â£Â½Ã¬â€”Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´. Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«Â¬Â´Ã«Å¾ËœÃ«Ââ€ž...
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Whoa, whoa, whoa, can you fix it?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No. No fix.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	But you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we've got to get this thing running.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Leave the man alone. He's right, "no fix." Take a look at that mess -- no way it's going to get running. How thick are you?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What's your problem, man? Why do you don't want this to work?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't care if it works. Why is it so important to you?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Because we could all use a little hope.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	If it's hope you're looking for ese, you're on the wrong damn island. There sure as hell ain't no hope here.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Hurley in bed asleep and David enters to wake him up.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Rise and shine; hit the deck. We're burning daylight; let's go. [Hurley moans grumpily] What's with the earphones?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's for the noise.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Well, your mother's a very passionate woman.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That is disgusting.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Come on, we're going on an adventure. Let's go.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not going anywhere with you.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Come on, just do this one thing with me. If it doesn't work, you can go to Australia. I won't stop you, okay?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What "one thing?"
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	We're going to break the curse.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Scene switches to David and Hurley in a psychic, Lynn Karnoff's, office.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	This is stupid.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Just give it a chance, man.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	[setting a tarot deck on the table] Cut the deck please. [flipping the first card] You've recently come into a great deal of money.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You could have seen that on the news.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	[flipping second card] But it hasn't brought you happiness. No, it's brought you great misfortune.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	She didn't see that on the news.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	I'm seeing numbers.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What numbers?
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. There's darkness around these numbers. Great tragedy. [she flips the third card, Death] I'm sorry.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why? What is it?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	Death surrounds you; and more is coming. Your hands, please. There's a curse on you. But it can be removed. [she starts toward another room] Now, Hugo, I need you to remove your clothes.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	My clothes?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	[carrying a large pot, begins dumping in spices, cracking eggs, etc.] A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you. And it must be exercised.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did my dad put you up to this?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	What?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hugo, please.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'll give you a thousand dollars right now if admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	The mystic arts are not subject to bribes. How dare you!
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	10,000.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LYNN	Your dad put me up to it.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I was just trying to help.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help who?
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Hurley praying as Jin and Sawyer talk.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Beer.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Beer.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Bingo. Beautiful. [tapping the van] Car.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Car.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[pointing to Hurley] International House of Pancakes. [to Hurley] What are you doing over there?
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm praying.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Praying for what?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, hell, I've got you a little help right here.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer tosses a can of beer in Hurley's direction and Hurley watches it roll down a hill. He suddenly gets an idea and leaves.]
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley approaches Charlie at the beach.]
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude. Hey, dude, stop moping. Come on.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Not moping -- thinking.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh-uh. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like? They're moping. So get up and come with me. That car I found? We're getting it running.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's the point? [Hurley slaps Charlie across the face] Ow! What did you do that for?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself because someone said you're going to die. I've got an idea that's going to help us both. [pulling him to his feet] Now, it is dangerous. And there's a very good chance that you will die.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That's supposed to convince me to come with you?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It is. Because if you don't die, then we win.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Win?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately and I could use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man." Let's make our own luck. What do you say?
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Jin at the van in the jungle.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm sorry.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I'm sorry.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay, nice. Keep it coming.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	You were right.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Okay. That's two. Hit me.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Those pants don't make you look fat.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now you got it -- only three things a woman needs to hear.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[entering] Come on. Get up; we've got work to do.
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What's your problem, Jumbotron.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Shut up! Red -- neck -- man.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	TouchÃƒÂ©. [Charlie enters] What is Jiminy Cricket doing here?
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We need another man.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Another man for what?
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	To push this car, dude.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Push it? Push it where?
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley walks over to Sawyer and pulls him up.]
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They push the van to the edge of a fairly steep hill.]
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, this is going to be real good.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Hurley packing as David enters.]
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	So, you're going to Australia, huh? [Hurley doesn't respond] Long way to go because of some stupid numbers.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'd really like you to leave.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	When your mom called me about the lottery I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. I'm getting old. Yeah, I saw my retirement. You're right. I'm here for the money.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, you're not getting any of it.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	That's not why I'm here talking to you now. I'm here talking to you now because going to Australia's not going to break any curse. You don't need to leave. You just -- you need a little hope. We make our own luck, Hugo. You know what I think you should do?
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	I think you should give away the money. All of it, every penny. Just save enough for a new carburetor -- work on the Camaro -- you know, just you and me -- take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the Grand Canyon. Never too late for a fresh start.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. [he starts to exit]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DAVID	Hey, I'll -- I'll be here when you get back.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see a shot down into a valley.]
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Are you nuts? You're not going to drive down that.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We're going to jumpstart it. You guys are going to push it. And then on the way down I'm going to pop the clutch and get it started.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You see those rocks? All you're going to do is crash into those real fast. If you don't roll over first.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Hurley, no.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dudes, I know how to drive. Now come on, just push me. This'll work; I know it.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Charlie] What are you out here for -- watch him crash and burn?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Came to ride shotgun.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, it's your funeral. [to Jin] Come on, let's give 'em their ride.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to Charlie] Are you sure you want to do this?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Victory or death.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Push!
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They push the van down the slope and it bounces along picking up speed.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, jeez.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Careful now. [they get closer to the boulders] Now would be a good time, Hurley. Like right now!
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	There is no curse. You make your own luck.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hurley!
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You make your own luck. There is no curse!
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He pops the clutch and the car starts. An old 8 track starts playing "Shambala" by Three Dog Night, as Charlie and Hurley laugh and whoop.]
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Son-of-a-bitch.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[raises his arms in the air] Hurley!
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Jin and Vincent run down to meet them, and they all have a joy ride.]
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Fade to a montage of Jin, Charlie and Sawyer returning to the beach. Jin gives Sun a white flower. Charlie talks to Claire. Sawyer carries the beer and wants to bring it to the "kitchen" and share, but can't bring himself to do it. Hurley sits contentedly in the van. Sawyer has a beer alone at his tent while wistfully watching the couples (Sun and Jin, Charlie and Claire).]
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate at night hiking with a torch. She finds some netting. Sayid and Locke enter.]
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Kate, if you were looking for help to find Jack why didn't you ask us?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Two reasons -- you don't know where to look and you're not motivated. And I don't blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back?
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're wrong.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after--
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it it'll lead us right to him.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[with some sarcasm] Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick when John was burying him.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So now you know our secret, how about you tell us yours?
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly there is gunfire, and Locke pulls his gun.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot. [calling out] It's alright! It's safe! We're just here to talk! You can come out!
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle enters cautiously.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	What are you doing here?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I came to ask for your help.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	To do what?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm heading to the Other's camp, and if I'm going to find it, I need someone who knows the island.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	What makes you think I have an interest in helping you?
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because they had me, and they would have never let me go -- probably would have killed me if I hadn't escaped. And the girl who helped me escape -- she was about 16 years old and her name was Alex. I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter.
