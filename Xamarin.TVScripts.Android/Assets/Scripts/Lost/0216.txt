104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	3 days. I'd like you to talk with him. You have experience with the Others. You were a cop. Seems to me you're the most qualified to figure out if this man's telling the truth.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Does Jack know you're coming to me with this?

436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA	Maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time you had a gun you murdered someone.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That's enough.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie takes the gun out and acts like he's going to give it to Ana but gives it to Sayid.]

450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh, up to two minutes.

454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I know. Where did Sawyer find one of these anyway? I mean, who flies with a pregnancy test, right?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Have you ever taken one?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Thank you for waiting with me and not asking why you're here and not Jin.

470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	There's only one way to find out.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack with the pregnancy test.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	These tests are pretty accurate. You know, a false negative in the first week maybe, but positive is a positive.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	But it's impossible.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Oh, it's possible. You feeling queasy, lightheaded?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Please, Jack. This is private, nobody can know.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're not going to tell Jin?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	In time I will, it's just -- it's complicated.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	As complicated as Jin being the last one on the Island to find out you spoke English? Sun, my advice -- and it's just that because I'm the last person to ask about this, but -- you should tell him. And when you do you should tell him everything -- the whole truth. I'm going to get back to the Hatch. Congratulations, Sun.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You've been down there a lot, Jack. Is everything okay?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sure, yeah, everything's fine. [he exits]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you okay? Sun?

Well, there'd be no balloon, so I'd draw a map to a real secluded place like a cave or some underbrush -- good place for a trap -- an ambush. And when your friends got there a bunch of my people would be waiting for them. Then they'd use them to trade for me. I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh? You guys got any milk?
