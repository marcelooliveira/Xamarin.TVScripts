Jack sees a dog, slowly gets up, in pain. Finds a little liquor bottle in his pocket. Then he runs though the bamboo and emerges on a tropical beach. He sees plane wreckage and people running around, screaming, in distress. The engine is still spinning. Charlie gets dangerously close to it. Jin yells out in Korean.]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt! Walt!
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT	Stay away from the gas! Stay there!
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shannon screaming. Jack looks up at the wing.]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT #2	[trapped under the piece with the still moving engine] Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Ahh, my leg! Ah! Ah!
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey you, just give me a hand! You, come on! Come over here, give me a hand! [A group of redshirts (and Locke) gather around to lift the metal piece that's trapping the man.] On the count of three: One, two, three.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pulls the man out from under. One leg is bloody. Jack starts ripping the man's pants to get to the wound. Jack uses his tie as a tourniquet.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Help! Please help me! Help me, please help me!
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sees Claire, who is is pregnant and on her hands and knees.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to a redshirt and Locke] All right, get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He runs over to Claire through a lot of wreckage.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Help me, please. I'm having, I'm having contractions.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How many months pregnant are you?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I'm, I'm nearly eight months.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks over and sees Boone doing CPR on Rose.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Claire] How far apart are they coming?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I don't know, a-a few just happened.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke and Redshirt carrying bad-leg-guy away. Another guy starts walking in front of the engine and Locke sees him.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey! Hey, hey, hey, get away from there!
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The guy gets sucked into the engine and the engine explodes. Shot of people running. Jack sort of falls on top of Claire to protect her.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Listen to me! Look at me! You're going to be okay, do you understand me? But you have to sit absolutely still!
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looking at Boone giving Rose mouth-to-mouth.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Hurley] Hey, you! Come here! I need you to get this woman away from these fumes! Take her over there. Stay with her. If her contractions occur any closer than three minutes apart, call out for me.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, you got to be kidding me.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll be right back, okay?
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thank you.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack starts running off.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey! What's your name?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jack.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack runs up to Boone and Rose.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Stop! Her head's not tilted far back enough. You're blowing air into her stomach.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	You sure?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack starts giving her mouth-to-mouth. ]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	That's exactly what I was doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, well, you need to seriously think about giving that license back.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Maybe we should do one of those hole things. You know, stick the pen in the throat?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone runs off to get pens.]
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[doing CPR] Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on!
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose breathes.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Big deep breaths. Take breaths!
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sound of metal. Jack looks up to see a big piece of metal high up (the wing) on some of the wreckage starting to wobble. Claire and Hurley are right under where it would fall. Jack runs over to them.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[as he's running] Move! Move! Move! Get her up! Get her out of there! The wing!
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Hurley, and Claire run out of way as there is a huge explosion. A big piece of burning debris lands near Charlie.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Claire] You okay?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Hurley] You? [Hurley sort of nods lying on the ground]. Stay with her.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sort of stumbling around the beach, looks into the fuselage. Takes a moment to steady himself, almost crying.]
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	[walking up holding out a handful of pens] I didn't know which one would work best.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	They're all good. Thanks.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack going through a suitcase, and finding a sewing kit. Jack going to a deserted part of the beach and taking his jacket and shirt off. He has a big gash on his side. Kate comes walking by, doesn't know Jack is there. Kate rubbing her wrist.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me. Did you ever use a needle?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you ever … patch a pair of jeans?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I, uhm, I made the drapes in my apartment.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's fantastic. Listen, do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks over to him.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	And with what?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	With this.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack shows her the wound, and she grimaces.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, I'd do it myself, I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You want me to sew that up?
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's just like the drapes, same thing.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, with the drapes I used a sewing machine.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, you can do this. I'm telling you. If you wouldn't mind.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack looks at her pleadingly.]
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Of course I will.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thank you. [handing her the little liquor bottle from his pocket] It's for your hands. Save me some for the, for the wound.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate picks up a little sewing kit.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Any color preference?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[laughing] No. Standard black.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack dumps the vodka on his wound.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sawyer lighting up a cigarette. Looking around. Then walking away, looks like he tosses his smoke down, disgusted-like; Claire standing by the shore; Hurley stacking airline food; Locke sitting alone looking out toward the ocean; Boone getting a "no service" signal on his cell phone.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Come on.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Sayid adding wood to a big fire.]
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[to Charlie] Hey you. What's your name?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Me? Charlie.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Charlie. We need help with the fire. No-one will see it if it isn't big.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, I'm on it. What's your name?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Sayid.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Rose kissing the ring on her necklace]
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sewing up Jack's wound.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I might throw up on you.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[shaking his head] You're doing fine.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of stars in night sky; Charlie writing F.A.T.E. on his taped fingers, sitting next to Sayid.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You think they would have come by now.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Huh? Who?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Anyone.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Shannon painting her toenails. Boone comes up, offers her a candy bar.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	As if I'm going to start eating chocolate.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Shannon, we may be here for a while.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	The plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where they are, they're coming. I'll eat on the rescue boat. [He offers the chocolate again]. I'll. Eat. On. The. Rescue. Boat. [Boone eats the chocolate.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Claire sitting on a piece of wreckage. Hurley comes up with a tray of airplane food.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hungry?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, thanks.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Anymore, uh... you know, baby stuff?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No. I'm-I'm okay.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, hang in there.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, you too.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley's arm comes back into the shot and gives her another meal.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Close up of Michael]
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You sure you're warm enough?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Walt lying on the beach under a blanket. He just nods, with a far-off look; shot of Jin and Sun.]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€šÂ´ Ã¬Ëœâ€ Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬â€žÅ“ Ã¬â€”â€ Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬Â§â‚¬Ã«Â©Â´ Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã«ÂÂ¼.

You must follow me wherever I go. Do you understand? Don't worry about the others. We need to stay together.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate standing over Jack while he's working on Marshal Mars, examining the Marshal's wound.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do you think he's going to live?
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you know him?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He was sitting next to me.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a leaf torn into the shape of an airplane.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[off camera at first] We must have been at about 40,000 feet when it happened. Hit an air pocket. Dropped, maybe, 200 feet. The turbulence was … I blacked out.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I didn't. I saw the whole thing. I knew that the tail was gone, but I couldn't bring myself to look back. And then the, the front of the plane broke off.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, it's not here on the beach. Neither is the tail. We need to figure out which way we came in.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because there's a chance we could find the cockpit. If it's intact, we might be able to find a transceiver. Send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How do you know all that?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Took a couple flying lessons. Wasn't for me.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I saw some smoke. Just through the valley. If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, I'm going with you.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know your name.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm Kate.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Jack.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Metal/weird sound coming from the jungle. Everyone on the beach is looking; Kate looks; Locke looks (the camera pans forward toward him for a close up); Walt looks; Shannon and Boone look.]
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	What was that?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks back at Jack; Charlie and Sayid look.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That was weird, right?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Is that Vincent?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt gets up and goes toward it.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[getting up to follow] It's not Vincent.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of trees moving/getting smashed down.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[coming into the frame] Did anybody see that?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[in disbelief] Yeah.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Boone gets up, moves off.]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Boone!
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone moving toward the sound, except Michael who backs off. Everyone looking out at the trees moving/getting smashed.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Terrific.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Shot out of airplane window over wing above clouds. Shot of Jack. Sound of cart rolling up.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	So, how's the drink?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's good.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	That wasn't a very strong reaction.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, it's not a very strong drink.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[hands him two more bottles] Shhh. Just don't tell anyone.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This of course breaks some critical FAA regulations.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack puts one of the bottles in his coat pocket and drinks the other. He stands up, then Charlie comes by him in the aisle.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Excuse me.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[in background, to Charlie] Sir, excuse me!
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	[looking at Charlie, then at Jack] Guess he really had to go.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Two Flight Attendants run by.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	Sir, excuse me!
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sits back down. Then there is turbulence. Jack puts on his seatbelt.]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CINDY	[on the intercom] Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Rose] It's normal.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh, I know. I've just never been a very good flier. My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, he sounds like a very smart man.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane is really shaking now.]
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry it's going to be over...
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[There's a sudden lurch and one passenger goes flying out of his seat and hits the ceiling. More shaking and screaming. The oxygen masks come down. Jack and Rose put their masks on. Shot of another guy putting his mask on.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Shot of ocean, then Jack looking out at the ocean. Rose and a bunch of redshirts in the background.]
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It didn't sound like an animal. Not exactly, I mean.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	That sound that it made, I keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Really? Where are you from?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	The Bronx.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Might be monkeys. It's monkeys, right?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sure it's monkeys. It's Monkey Island.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're on an Island.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[coming up behind Jack] You ready?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, you showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm coming.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[smiling] Well, you're going to need better shoes.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a dead body's feet. Kate reaches down to take hiking boots, checks the size. She looks at Locke, who's looking at her. He gives her the "orange" smile. He keeps eating the orange and looks away. She looks slightly freaked out/disgusted.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of a group: Michael, Walt, Charlie, Sayid, Boone and Shannon, with Hurley approaching.]
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Whatever it was … it wasn't natural.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Does anyone have any sun block?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	Yeah, I do.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah. Cool.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, I was just looking inside the fuselage … It's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the, uh … [stopping and looking at Walt] b-o-d-y-s?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What are you spelling, man? "Bodies"?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	B-o-d-i-e-s.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That sounds like a good idea.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SHANNON	No! They'll deal with it when they get here.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[entering] We go out and look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver, to send a distress signal, help the rescue team. (To Boone) You're going to need to keep an eye on the wounded. If the guy in the suit wakes up, try to keep him calm, but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel. You understand?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah, got it. What about the guy with the leg? The, the tourniquet.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night. He … he should be all right.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BOONE	Yeah. Cool. Good job.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'll come with you. I want to help.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't need any more help.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, it's cool, I don't really feel like standing still, so. [Jack nods.] Excellent.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of valley looking out toward sea. You can see Jack, Charlie, and Kate in the distance coming toward camera.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	May I ask you something?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Have we ever met, anywhere?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, that would be unlikely.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hum.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I look familiar, though, right?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Sighs.] Can't quite place it?
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, I can't.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. I think I know.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You do?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[singing] You all everybody … You all everybody! You've never heard that song?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I've heard it. I just don't know what the hell it is-
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That's us. Drive Shaft. Look, the ring-second tour of Finland. You've never heard of Drive Shaft?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[incredulous] The band?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, the band.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You were in Drive Shaft.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Seriously?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, Charlie. Track 3, you know, I do backing vocals.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	My friend Beth would freak. She loved you guys.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Give me Beth's number, I'll call her, I'd, I'd love to.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey-
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Does she live nearby?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Have you ever heard of Drive Shaft?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[singing] You all everybody... You all every...body.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[shakes his head] We've got to keep moving.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	They were good.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	They are good. We're still together. In the middle of a comeback.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Camera pans down to reveal Vincent]
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke alone on the beach looking out to sea; we see clouds forming, sound of thunder. Shot of Kate, Charlie, Jack in the jungle in the rain.]
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey guys, is this normal? Kind of ... day turning into night, you know? End of the world type weather. Is this-guys?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Locke sitting on the beach with people running around to get out of the rain. Locke just sits there. Jin kicks a guy out from Jin and Sun's little overhang of debris; Hurley runs past Boone and Shannon who are racing to get inside the fuselage.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know if you want to go in there! There's too many bodies.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Michael holding something up (some kind of tarp?) under some debris, puts his arm on Walt's shoulder. Shot of Locke alone on the beach in a sort of meditation pose (music is sort of bittersweet). Locke holds his arms out, turns his face up to the rain, seems happy; we see the Monster in the jungle by the beach. Claire and Rose see it.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	There it is again.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh my god.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack, Kate, Charlie coming upon the cockpit. They all look a bit scared.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well? Let's do this.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Jack, Kate, and Charlie making their way to the cockpit wreckage.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Let's get this trans…
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Transceiver.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Transceiver thing and get out of here.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see them climbing up, through the front of the plane. There are dead bodies. Jack can't open the cockpit door, bangs on it with a fire extinguisher.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Come on! Come...
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The door opens and a body comes falling out.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Kate] You okay?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah. You?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. Okay?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Kate] Hey. You don't have to come up here.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, I'm good.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Jack get inside the cockpit.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So, what does a transceiver look like?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Complicated walkie-talkie.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate climbs over the pilot looking for the transceiver when suddenly the pilot takes a breath. Jack and Kate are shocked.]
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey! Can you hear me? [to Kate] I need that water. [He gives the pilot some water] Here. Here you go. Hey.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	How many survived?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	At least 48. Does anything feel broken?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. It's probably a concussion.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	How long has it been?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sixteen hours.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	Sixteen? Has anybody come?
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not yet.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	Six hours in, our radio went out. No-one could see us. We turned back to land in Fiji. By the time we hit turbulence, we … we were a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	We have a transceiver.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The pilot moves to go get it.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Good. Good, that's what we were hoping. Listen, you shouldn't try to move.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	No, no. I'm okay. It's okay. Transceiver's right there. It's right there.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gets it and hands it to the pilot.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Kate] Where's Charlie?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate goes to look for Charlie. The pilot is fiddling with the transceiver.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	It's not working.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[going through cabin, seeing two dead bodies] Charlie?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie comes out of the bathroom.]
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What were you doing in the bathroom?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The plane starts shaking. We hear the monster sounds. Shot of Kate and Charlie, Pilot and Jack reacting.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	What the hell was that?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate going back into Cockpit with Charlie's help.]
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's right outside.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PILOT	What, what's right outside?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Shhhh.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks terrified. We see the shadow of the monster going past window. Jack tries to look out the window to see it. The pilot goes up to try and see it. Briefly hesitating, he first puts the transceiver on the co-pilot's seat, then climbs part way out of an opening above. Charlie comes into the cockpit. The pilot gets snatched out of a broken window. There's blood all over the window.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What the hell just happened?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Big crashing and shaking. Jack reaches for the transceiver just before it falls. The cockpit falls to the ground from its inclined position. Jack is reaching for the transceiver.]
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack, come on!
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Just leave it!
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs it. They run. Monster sounds, running, anxious music. Charlie falls. His leg is trapped in some vines.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[shouts] Hey!
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack goes back to rescue him.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Okay, let's run.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate keeps running and ends up alone.]
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[terrified] J-J-J... Jaaaack! [Big door slamming sound/big footstep sounds. Kate is trying to compose herself] One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Kate, she hears something and looks off. Charlie comes up behind her, she turns to find him and knocks him down.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Kate!
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where the hell is Jack?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know!
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Did you see him?
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, he pulled me up!
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where is he?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know!
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How can you not know?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We got separated! Look, I … I fell down, and he, he came back for me, that thing was just…
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Did you see it?
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No. No! But it was right there. We were dead! I was. An-And then Jack came back, and he, he pulled me up. I don't know where he is.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate looks around.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We have to go back for him.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Go back? There? Kate, there's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Then don't come.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate walks off, Charlie gets up to follow (reluctantly).]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Kate!
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of jungle. Kate and Charlie walking around.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I heard you shout. I heard you shout "Jack". I'm Charlie, by the way.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sees something.]
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What is that?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate picks up pilot's wings from the muddy ground. Shot shifts focus from wings to the reflection in the water where they see the pilot's body in the tree above them.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What is...
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[approaching] It's the pilot.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Did you see it?
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. It was right behind me, but... I dove into the bushes.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[pointing up to the pilot in the tree] Guys? How does something like that happen?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of bloody pilot in the treetop, bloody and with face-skin torn off, but not eaten.]
