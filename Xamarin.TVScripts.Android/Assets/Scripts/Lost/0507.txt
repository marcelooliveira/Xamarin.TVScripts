The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham

4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - A dark office. The door creaks open. The intruder surveys the lay of the land: desks and shelves neatly piled with books and documents in folders and various other claptrap--including a small bear skull. Moonlight illumines a few leafy plants, visible through the venetian blinds of the office windows. The intruder is the man who stood behind Jack in line at the Ajira Airways ticketing counter, and sat near Hurley on Flight 316. He tugs at a desk lamp, and the bulb sheds light on the room. On a table, amongst chemical bottles and glassware and textbooks and a chart of the human anatomy, the man finds a sturdy flashlight and clicks it on. The man leafs through a pile of magazines. The one on the top is an issue of Life from April 16, 1954, having a color picture of a bubble-like hydrogen bomb test blast captioned "THE AWESOME FIREBALL". The man eyes a set of file cabinets, then breaks the locks off and extracts a single file folder. Kneeling with the folder opened on the floor, he pushes aside one folded map, and examines another, printed on a single leaf. It is the same map to the Tempest earlier used by Charlotte and Faraday, with large swaths of land marked "Unknown" and hieroglyphs on the open ocean. The next piece of paper he examines shows a network of nodes, one of them marked "EVENT A", another "EVENT B", with the lines linking the nodes labeled "SPACE-TIME", "REAL TIME", "IMAGINARY SPACE", "IMAGINARY TIME"--all in all, this looks very much like something drawn by Daniel Faraday. As the man puzzles, he looks up to see something attached to the underside of the desk. He pries it off--it's a sawed-off shotgun--fully loaded. He puts it in his bag.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Caesar.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The door creaks as it swings shut behind a woman. It's the woman we saw escorting the handcuffed Sayid on Flight 316.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Ilana. What's up?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Find anything?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	No. Nothing useful.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Then what'd you just put in your bag?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	...Oh.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He removes the flashlight from his bag and shines the light in her eyes. Then he throws it at her. She catches it.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	If you want it, it's yours.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	We found someone--a man.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	What?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Roxanne was scouting just south of here, and he was just standing in the water. He's wearing a suit.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Moments later, Ilana and Caesar trek down a large gravel clearing at night, past the wreck of the crash-landed Flight 316.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Nobody recognizes him?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	No. Whoever he is, he didn't come with us.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Then how do we know he isn't one of the ones who disappeared?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	He's not.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	And how do you know?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Because he wasn't on the plane.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	What did this man have to say?
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	You can ask him yourself.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Viewed from above, it appears that the plane veered just off the large gravel clearing as it crash-landed.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Caesar and Ilana emerge from vegetation onto a beach, where roughly a dozen men and women loiter around a well-built campfire. Passenger luggage is strewn all about the sand. Caesar kneels down before a man shrouded in a blanket.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Hello.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN	Hello.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	My name is Caesar. What's yours?
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man removes the blanket cloaking his head. It's Locke.]
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	My name is John Locke.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke stands alone on the beach. The ocean waves lap at his bare feet. He gazes off into the distance at another island. The Island.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Morning.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ilana trods up, barefooted as well.]
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Breakfast?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She hands him a mango.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	We found a tree. They're pretty good.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Much obliged.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	I'm Ilana.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Thumbing to himself] John. [Thumbing behind him] Are those your boats?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Various crash survivors comb through two outrigger canoes pulled safely up on the beach.]
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	No. They were already here. There used to be three, but the pilot and some woman took one. Didn't tell anyone, just ran off in the middle of the night.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The pilot of the plane that brought you here?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Yes. That's right.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Do you have a passenger list?
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	[Sighs] You'll have to talk to Caesar.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke takes a big bite of the peeled mango.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Mmm. [Chuckles] I think this is the best mango I've ever eaten.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	[Turning serious] Nobody remembers you being on the plane.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, I don't remember being on it either.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	What do you remember?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I remember a lot.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Like why you're dressed up so nice?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, but I can guess.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	[Insistently] Please. Guess.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think this suit is what they were gonna bury me in.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Sorry?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You asked what I remembered. I remember dying.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ilana, stymied, walks off. John muses, and flashes back...]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - The wheel chamber. The wheel creaks and clanks as unseen forces move it violently from behind, a green light pouring out of the socket.]
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Good luck, John.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke gets a grip on the wheel. It cranks and clanks as he lifts it and pulls it back, and the light emanates and grows brighter, accompanied by a buzzing sound and a magnetic hum. The light envelops everything. Locke looks surprised. He turns to Christian.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Say hello to my son.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Who's your son?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The hum crescendos into a high-pitched chirp, the light overpowers, and suddenly--]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[--Locke lies on the ground with his eyes closed and the white light fades away. He awakes with a start to find himself alone on the desert floor. The wind howls. The pain of his broken leg returns to him and he groans. Then he gags, and turns over and spits up on the sand.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Subtitle: Tunisia]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke spits some grit out of his mouth and cries as he looks at his leg. It's bad. The bone sticks out through the flesh, and through the fabric of his pants.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Aah!
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He groans and pants, and looks up to see a pole topped by a security camera, which is shielded from the elements by a single bent rusted piece of corrugated roofing steel. A series of wooden poles carry the limp cord for power and signal for the camera away into the vastness. Locke cries out.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	If anybody is there, can you help me?!
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He tries to turn over. It is futile to move.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Aah! Aah!
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Night has fallen, and Locke remains in the same spot, alone and shivering. Suddenly, the rumble of an approaching vehicle, and a glowing pair of headlights come around the bend in the distance. Locke turns over and tries to shout and wave.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hey! No! Hey! Hey!
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Just when it looks like the truck is about to run him over, tires skid and the truck comes to a stop just in front of him. Four armed Bedouin men shout in Arabic as they pile out of the pickup. Each one grabs a limb and they lift Locke into the truck's flatbed.]

186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daybreak, a small hospital of just 8 beds. Three of the turbaned men carry Locke through the door.]

234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The doctor hands off the water glass, then pushes Locke's jaw shut until Locke complies, gagging and grunting. Another shout for the nurse. Off in the distance, of the hospital, behind a sheer drape, Locke sees the tall, thin figure of a dark-skinned man--it's Matthew Abaddon.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DOCTOR	Ayesha!

258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke groans. His screams are muffled. A nurse tears a sheet. The doctor drizzles an antiseptic on Locke's leg wound, eliciting more muffled screams from Locke, then pats down the wound with gauze.]

264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The doctor makes ready to pull on Locke's broken lag. Locke shakes his head vigorously in protest, but he is held down. Locke's muffled shouts and screams do nothing to mask the sound of crunching bone as the doctor sets the broken leg by pushing it into place. Locke looks at the doctor, the Bedouins, the nurse, and they begin to go blurry. His screams subside, and, as he hears some final words spoken in Arabic about him, he goes unconscious.]

He leaves through the door, and as he does, he turns around and looks at Locke one last time.]
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I'll miss you, John. I really will.
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The camera pans to Locke's body hanging from the ceiling.]
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Locke walks through the door of an office and sees Caesar reading files at a desk. Door creaks.]
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That symbol--it belongs to an organization called the DHARMA Initiative. They were conducting some experiments here a while back.
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	How do you know that?
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I spent more than a hundred days on this Island. I know a lot.
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	A hundred days? So when we crashed, you were already here.
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No. No, I, uh... I left.
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	How long ago did you leave?
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Sighs] The timing would just confuse ya.
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Well... how did you get back?
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	To be honest, that part's a bit of a mystery to me.
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Okay, John Locke... I have a mystery, too. Maybe you can help me with it.
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm happy to try.
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	On the plane, I was sitting across the aisle from that really big guy with curly hair. When the plane started shaking--really shaking--there was a big noise and a bright light. And this really big guy with curly hair... was gone, man. I mean, literally gone. And it wasn't only him. Some of us saw it happen to other people, too. So, Mr. John Locke, do you have an idea about what happened?
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think... I might know how I came to be here. But that would involve me finding my friends. Do you have a--a--a passenger list?
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	No. The pilot took it when he ran off.
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And everyone's accounted for--all the people? O--other than the--the ones who disappeared.
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	Yeah, yeah, except for the people who got hurt.
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	"The people who got hurt"?
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In another room, Locke looks over the wounded, who lay silent on cots. He stops and regards one unconscious man.]
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CAESAR	You know him?
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah.
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The one he's looking at is Ben.]
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	He's the man who killed me.
