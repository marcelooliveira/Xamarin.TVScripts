6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A needle lands on a record. Hurley is in the food storage area eating candy, chips, cereal, a steak, and ice cream. Suddenly Jin appears.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Hi there, Hurley.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jin, you're here.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I sure am.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, you speak English.
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No, you're speaking Korean.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ã«â€šËœ? [Subtitle: I am?]
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley stands and suddenly there is a chicken-mascot-man standing next to Jin.]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ã¬Â â‚¬ Ã¬Â¹Å“ÃªÂµÂ¬ Ã¬â€”Â¬ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã¬â€žÅ“ Ã«Â­ÂÃ­â€¢ËœÃ«Å â€ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼? [Subtitle: What's he doing here?]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We start hearing the countdown "blip" sound.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Everything's going to change.
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ã«Â­Â? [Subtitle: What?]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Everything's going to change. Have a cluckity-cluck-cluck day, Hugo.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The chicken-mascot-man says "Hurley" in Kate's voice.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hurley!
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley wakes up and we see 3:44 on the timer.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You fell asleep?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No, I was just -- resting my eyes.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[touching a post-it on the computer monitor] The Numbers are written right there.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I remember the Numbers. [Hurley starts entering the Numbers.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Locke went back to the beach. So, I'll be taking the next shift.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Awesome.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack told me about your job. At least we have jobs again, right?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hurray for us. [He presses the execute button and the counter resets to 108:00.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Michael and Jin in the dug-out prison.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ain't life grand. What I wouldn't give for a cup of water right now.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€šËœÃ«Â¥Â¼ Ã¬ËœÂ¬Ã«Â Â¤ Ã¬Â¤Ëœ. Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬â€žÅ“! Ã­ÂÂ¬ÃªÂ¸Â° Ã­â€¢ËœÃ¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«Â§Ë†! [He motions to Sawyer to lift him up again.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No way. No more human pyramids -- just forget it.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[yelling] Hey. Hey! Hey, let us out of here!
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No. Just -- chill!
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Every minute I spend down here is another minute my boy is still out there.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, let me break it down for you, Mikey. Right now, Rambina and her buddies are trying to figure out what to do with us. Until they make up their damn mind there ain't nothing we can do.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[pointing to Sawyer's shoulder.] Ã¬â€“Â´ÃªÂ¹Â¨Ã¬â€”Â Ã¬Æ’ÂÃ¬Â²ËœÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ¬Â£Â¼ Ã¬â€¹Â¬Ã­â€¢Â´Ã«Â³Â´Ã¬â€”Â¬.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ah, yeah. Why don't you pee on it?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The cover is lifted from the pit and a rope is dropped down.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LEADER	[lowering a rope and pointing to Jin] Grab the rope. Please.
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't do it.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[approaching with a gun] Climb the rope or I shoot your friend.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin goes up the rope.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[to Michael] You next.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't do it. She's bluffing. The gun's only got one bullet. She ain't going to waste it-
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer gets hit in the head with a rock and goes down.]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ow, son-of-a-bitch. Ow, God.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[to Michael] Grab the rope.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael climbs up the rope.]
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You want me, Hotlips, you're going to have to come down here and get me -- [The cover closes and the screen goes to black] -- bitch.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Hurley standing with the winning lotto ticket in his hand, watching the TV showing his winning numbers.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARY JO	4, 8, 15, 16, and 23, with the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share in, a near record jackpot.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOTTO OFFICIAL	That's right, Mary Jo, because this is the 16th week without a winner.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley passes out, and Hurley's mom, Carmen, comes to check on him.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Hugo? Hu.. Hugo! Hugo, wake up. Wake up! [She slaps his face, vigorously.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Stop, ow, ow, mom, stop. I just slipped.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Slipped sitting down? Is it your heart?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Mom, I'm fine.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	You're lying. I always know because you don't look me in the eye.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not lying.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Then tell me what happened, huh?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley folds over the lottery ticket to hide it.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It must be something I ate.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Yes, it must be something you ate because you eat basura, and you don't exercise.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I do exercise.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Falling down is not exercise. The only time you move is to lift a drumstick from the bucket. Everyday it's the same thing, Hugo -- you work, TV, chicken. You have to change your life, Hugo. You think someone else will change it for you? Maybe if you pray everyday, Jesus Christ will come down from heaven, take 200 pounds and bring you a decent woman, and a new car. Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Maybe I don't want to change. Maybe I like my life.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The phone rings.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CARMEN	Oh, that must be Jesus. [She goes to another room and picks up the phone.] Hola, momento. [Calling to Hurley] Yes, it is Jesus! He wants to know what color car you want!
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back to the Island. Hurley at the beach splashing water on his face. Charlie approaches.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hurley, we need to have a little chat. Don't worry, mommy's off for a walk, so it's just you, me and the baby. Spill it.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Spill what?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's in it?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, nothing, really.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You've been out there an entire day and night -- looking at nothing?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, I guess it's kind of like a bunker, you know, from WWII, only newer.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's in it?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't know.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	But somehow you know it's a bunker?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, I guess someone told me.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You're going to lie to me? You're going to lie to the baby?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, look, I'd never lie.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, and the time you told you were worth 150 million dollars?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's 156 million.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm sorry, I must have confused it with the 900 trillion I am worth myself. And this baby's made of chocolate lollipops. So, if you'll excuse us, I'm going to flap my wings and fly off this Island!
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose doing laundry on the beach. Hurley enters.]
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, Rose.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Hey yourself.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So, doing laundry, huh?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Indeed I am. You want to hand me those dirty clothes over there? [Hurley hands her a suitcase.] Thank you.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Don't you want to know what happened?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	What happened?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, out there. Everyone's asking me what's in the Hatch.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	That's your business, honey.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Don't you want to know?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Well, whatever it is, it's not going to help get this laundry done, now is it?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, actually, it sort of is.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Rose walking in the jungle.]
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's around here somewhere.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley finds the bunker entrance and he and Rose go inside.]
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Someone actually lived down here?
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh-huh.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh. What -- what is it for?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's kind of a long story.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[entering] Hurley? Who else did you tell?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No one. I swear. Dude, it's a big job. I needed -- help.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Hello, Jack.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, Rose.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	She's cool. She won't tell anyone.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Honey, I don't even know what I would say.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire walking along the beach. She's sees the bottle of messages from the raft wash up in the surf.]
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Rose and Hurley go into the food storage room.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	All this is food?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's only a matter of time before we have to tell everyone what we found down here. [To Hurley] So, do you know what to do?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Inventory of all of it, and figure out how we make it last.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	And in the meantime, nobody gets anything -- no exceptions. That's your responsibility, Hurley. Okay?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We can hear the countdown alarm start blipping.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	What's that?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You don't want to know.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Rose doing the inventory.]
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	DHARMA Initiative Salad Dressing - Ranch composite. Sounds tasty.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose laughs. Hurley opens a box full of Apollo bars.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Apollo bars? Ever hear of these?
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Huh-uh, but candy is candy. That's what Bernard always says. Talk about a sweet-tooth. That man has a mouth full of sweet-teeth.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Bernard, that was your husband?
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Is my husband.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, but, I thought he was in the back of the plane. [Rose gives him a look.] I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh, no, no -- that's okay. Don't feel bad. Bernard is fine. I know it. You want to get the canned tuna?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Everyone's going to hate me, Rose.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Now that's just plain silly. You're about the only one on this Island that everybody loves.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, that'll change.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey, you guys happen to find any shampoo in here?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Yeah, there's some right over here.
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, Kate, you can't take...
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[grabbing the shampoo] Thanks, Hurley. [She exits.]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	It's just one bottle.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's where it starts.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Hurley looking at his lotto ticket while he's at work at Mr. Clucks. Hurley's friend, Johnny, enters.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Hey, Hugo. You okay, man?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[putting the lotto ticket in his pocket] Yeah, I'm fine.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	[Hurley's boss] Reyes, my office, now!
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley goes to Randy's office.]
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	You want to tell me something, Reyes?
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, no.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	You sure about that?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, yeah?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	This is last night's surveillance tape.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Randy plays a tape which shows Hurley reading and eating a piece of chicken.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	You owe the company for an 8 piece dark meat combo.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I didn't eat 8 pieces!
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	You want to watch the whole tape? Oh, and while you're here, how many times do I get to tell you those napkins cost money, alright? It's two per customer -- two. We are not made of money here at Mr. Clucks, Reyes. I'm not made of money. Are you made of money? Because if you're made of money -- maybe you don't want to work here. So get it together. What -- is that a problem, Reyes?
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, I quit.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley is breathing into a Mr. Clucks paper bag in the parking lot outside work. Johnny comes out.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Dude, are you okay?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm, I'm fine.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Randy's losing his brain in there.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You should get back in there or he'll have you scrubbing johns for the rest of the week.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Doubt it. I quit, too.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Looks like we've got ourselves a day off. Who needs money when you've got good looks?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Locke walking through the jungle. He picks some fruit up from under a tree.]
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You can come out now. I saw you back at the rock, and then at the mangrove tree. In fact, I walked in a big circle. I'm not sure how you didn't realize it.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie comes out.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Alright, you don't have to insult me.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[eating the fruit] You want to tell me why you've been following me, Charlie?
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. Quite simply, John, there are a lot of secrets around here, and I'm tired of being at the bloody kid's table. I got Claire's baby back. I didn't go swanning off to the Black Rock on the bloody A-Team mission, but I would have if someone had asked me. I think I'm entitled to some sodding answers around here.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What do you want to know?
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid hits a wall in the bunker with a large piece of metal, trying to break through. Jack enters.]
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How's it going?
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's not. On the other side of this door there's more concrete. I'd say it's at least 8 to 10 feet thick.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You see this? [Jack shows how his key is affected by the magnetic field.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Interesting. Good thing this [referring to the piece of metal he's using as a pick-axe] is titanium. Almost no magnetic attraction. But we're not going to get in up here.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Up here?
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid lifts up a grate in the floor and they look down.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Perhaps we can go under it.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The "leader" guy of the tail-section group lifts the cover off the dug-out prison and throws a rope down for Sawyer.]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LEADER	Grab the rope.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't doing nothing 'til I know if my friends are okay.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[coming into frame] So, we're friends now, huh?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[coming into frame] Do it now, or the rope comes up.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer gets pulled up out of the pit where there is a group waiting.]
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Howdy boys. Thanks for the rescue.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Everything's cool. We had a talk and they believe we were on the plane, too.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Swell, I guess we can all sue Oceanic together.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[to Sawyer who's trying to hide that he's holding a rock] What you got there?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nothing.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	You got a rock? You looking for some revenge? You've got 3 seconds to drop it.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LEADER	Ana...
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	1, 2...
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now, hold on...
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana throws an elbow across Sawyer's face, and he falls to the ground. Leader guy holds Jin back. Ana steps on Sawyer's wounded shoulder.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ow, you didn't say 3.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She stomps on his shoulder.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Shut up. When I tell you to do something, you do it -- I say move, you move -- I say stop, you stop. I say jump, what do you say?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You first.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[stomping his shoulder again] You don't like the rules, I toss your ass back in the pit right now, you understand?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I understand.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer gets up in a lot of pain.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	It's getting dark, we're moving out.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Moving out where?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	What did I just tell you?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sorry, forgot. Just one thing, though -- you hit me again, I'll kill you.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana just smiles in an amused sort of way.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	Let's go.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael and Jin wait for Sawyer. They all start walking through the jungle.]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Locke talking in the jungle.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	He pushed that button every 108 minutes?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	He did indeed.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	But how is that possible? I mean, didn't he sleep?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Don't know -- didn't get a chance to ask him.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	And after all that time, he just up and left? I mean, why? Where'd he go?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Don't know. I tried to track him, but he didn't leave much of a trail. I guess he figured he found his replacements.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Meaning us?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Meaning us.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It -- sounds a bit nutty, doesn't it?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It is what it is, Charlie.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	And what happens if we don't push it?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We're not going to find out. I'm setting up a system. I'm still working on it, but it looks like it's going to be two person shifts every 6 hours or so.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Shifts? Pushing a button?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Oh, and there's a record player.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's Hurley been doing there?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	He's in charge of the food.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Food?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley sitting at the beach alone. Charlie enters.]
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey mate? Where you been?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey, I've been -- around.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I know, Hurley.
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know what?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I know about the food. Locke told me everything.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, well, Locke's lying.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh yeah, is he lying about the button we have to push every 108 minutes or the Island will explode?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not going to explode!
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah [Charlie points at Hurley like: I gotcha], come on.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, Jack put me in charge. Look, I don't even want...
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is there peanut butter?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Peanut butter -- nutty, creamy, staple of children everywhere.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, yeah. A couple jars.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Brilliant. How about you give us one? -- It's for Claire.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No can do, man.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You're saying no to a nursing mother?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's not like that.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, it's exactly like that. You know, I never thought this would happen but it did. You've become one of them.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	One of them?
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Them - the man... management! I thought we were friends. You've changed, man.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Hurley and Johnny in a record store looking through the sale bin. They tentatively sing the lyrics to You All Everybody while looking at the CD in the One Hit Wonders Section.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Drive Shaft - more like Suck Shaft.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm going to go check out the headphones.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Sure, headphones.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a girl behind a counter smile when Hurley approaches.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STARLA	Hu-go.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Star-la.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STARLA	Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	We're currently exploring other opportunities.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STARLA	You quit?
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I did.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	He's mixing it up today. He's off the rail. Somebody get a straitjacket.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[pointing at some headphones] Hey, can I try those on?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STARLA	You're messing with my worldview here, Hugo. You're my rock. I mean if you quit your job the next thing you know bees will stop making honey, and flowers will die, and, hell, the whole damn thing will fall apart.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[talking too loud because he has headphones on] So, Starla!
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Starla takes the headphones off Hurley.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry. Uh, well, The Hold Steady is playing the Troubadour this weekend, and I was wondering -- maybe Friday...
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STARLA	Um, I have to work.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, no, I didn't mean...
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	STARLA	I could probably go Saturday. Is that cool?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, that's totally cool.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	[as they are leaving the record store] Dude, you've been crushing on this girl for months and doing nothing. Today you're fricking Fabio. Seriously, man, what has gotten into you?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nothing, I just wanted to ask her out before...
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Before what?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nothing.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sayid and Jack in tunnels under the bunker.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This is the last duct. I believe we're under the area where we began. They poured concrete all the way down here, too.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid starts hitting the wall with the piece of metal.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Just as thick.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Maybe there's a way around it.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They crawl forward under what looks like pipes.]
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What is all this stuff?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	My best guess? There's a geothermal generator behind this wall. That's the power source. Careful with these pipes, they're very hot.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They come to the end of the tunnel.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's it -- nothing -- it's blocked. So what do you think, Sayid?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What do I think about what, Jack?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This place -- the computer? What do you think is going on?
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The last time I heard of concrete being poured over everything in this way was Chernobyl.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear loud sound coming from the pipes.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you hit something?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't think so. It's coming from over there.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm going to check it out.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack climbs up through a grate in the floor and finds Kate getting out of the shower.]
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You, um, you took a shower.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I had to see if it worked.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How was it?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[in a towel, trying to pick up her clothes] Uh, pressure sucked, it kind of went cold at one point, and it smelled a little bit like sulfur but -- it was a shower.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I know what you mean.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You could use one.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Maybe a little later.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[exiting] I'll leave the shampoo for you.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The tail-section people, plus the raft guys walking through the jungle. Someone stumbles and Michael helps her.]
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I'm Libby.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Michael.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	How many of you -- you know, on the other side of the Island?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	When we left, around 40. How many of you survived?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	23 of us.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LEADER	[to Sawyer] Are you alright?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Now you give a damn.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LEADER	I said I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	A misunderstanding is when you bring me lemonade instead of iced-tea.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	I said: no talking.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He was talking to me.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ANA LUCIA	[stopping in the jungle] We're here.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What are you going to do -- beam us up?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ana knocks on the bunker door like the one on station 3. A man opens. They file inside. It doesn't appear to have any equipment or furniture in it. There is a DHARMA logo on the wall. There is only one other woman inside.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[to Libby] I thought you said there were 23 of you.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	There were.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun working in her garden. Claire and Shannon enter with the bottle of messages.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Hi, Sun.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What's wrong?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I -- I found something out in the water, and I told Shannon about it, and we thought you should know about it. [Shannon hands the bottle to Sun.] It's the messages from the raft. We thought you should decide what to do.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke looking over a rifle in the hatch armory. Hurley enters.]
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why'd you tell Charlie, man?
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because he asked, Hugo.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, well you shouldn't have. You should have listened to me about coming down here, period. Now it's all going to change, everything.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Change is good, Hugo.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You know, people say that, but it's not true, man. Trust me, I know. And guess who gets to be the bad guy who has to say: no you can't have peanut butter for the cute blonde and her poor Island baby. You know who? It's me. -- You know what? I'm not going to do it. Find someone else to deal with the chow, man.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, we all have our jobs, Hugo. My job is to convince people to push a button every 108 minutes without them knowing why -- or for what. Wanna trade?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't want to do this, man!
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, I've had a lot of jobs I didn't want to do. I still did them. I'm sorry, Hugo, you don't get to quit.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, then.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley walking through the jungle. He gets the leftover dynamite from a hiding place in a tree.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Johnny and Hurley stealing garden gnomes.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Be careful.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, I am!
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	You got it?
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I got it.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Alright, let's go.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They run to a van and place another gnome with the stash in the back of the van.]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Do you think we got enough gnomes?
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay, we're good.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They get in the van and then are in someone else's yard.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	This is genius.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	A little to the left, dude, and more of an angle.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Someone opens the front door of a house.]
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RANDY	Hey!
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Run!
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They take off in the van and leave Randy standing in his driveway in his underwear. The camera pans to the lawn to reveal the gnomes have been used to spell out the words "Cluck You" on the lawn.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Cluck you, Randy!
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	[yelling out the van window] Freedom!
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[laughing] Dude, what are you doing?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Freedom! So, anything else you want to do tonight -- you better let me know now -- because our day off is just about over, Huggy Bear. In about 10 hours we going to have to find ourselves some new employment. I hear Pizza Bin is hiring, or we could try our luck at, ah, Gyro-Rama. But I do kind of dig the chick who works at the Bin.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, promise me something.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Okay, what?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Promise me that no matter what happens, we'll never change -- this will never change.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Okay. Oh, I know what this is about. I know why you've been acting so weird lately. You're getting that, uh, that, uh, stomach stapling surgery thing, aren't you?
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not getting surgery.
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Awe, c'mon man, it's cool. I mean, I could still be all surprised and be like, ooh, my, Hurley, wow, is that you?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Listen, Johnny, I'm serious. Promise me that you and I will always stay the same.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	I'll do you one better. Not only will I stay gold, Ponyboy, I will drink to it. [He looks in his empty wallet.] Can I borrow 2 bucks?
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley in the food storage room, placing a fuse in the dynamite. Rose enters.]
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	What have you got there, Hurley?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh, it's dynamite.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Dynamite? Well, what are you doing with it?
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm sorry, but I can't let it happen again.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Hurley and Johnny pulling into a gas station. There's a news crew interviewing the sales clerk.]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Why is there a news crew here?
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, we shouldn't go here. Dude, let's go, they jack the prices here.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	[getting out of the van] Maybe somebody got shot.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks at his lotto ticket.]
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Rose and Hurley in the storage room.]
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Why are you doing this, honey?
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Look, just get out of here, Rose.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	But you're going to hurt somebody.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Not if I do it from outside the door. It's thick, and I'll make sure there's nobody around first. So, please, will you just go?
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Uh-uh, you hauled me off of the beach and you dragged me into this place -- the least I can get is an explanation before you blow it up!
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You don't get it! This is going to mess it all up!
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Hurley looking at his lotto ticket in the van.]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JOHNNY	Dude, somebody won the lottery!
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley and Rose in the storage room.]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Let me tell you something, Rose! We were all fine before we had any [he pulls chips off the shelf] potato chips! But now we've got these potato chips and everybody's going to want them! So Steve gets them, and Charlie's pissed -- but he's not pissed at Steve, he's pissed at me!
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - The gas station clerk pointing at Hurley in the van.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GAS STATION CLERK	That's the guy! That's the guy!
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Johnny stares at Hurley, looking hurt/surprised. A brief shot of Hurley and Rose, then shots from the gas station shown during the following lines.]
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And I'm going to be in the middle of it! And then it's going to be: well, what about us -- why didn't I get any potato chips? C'mon, help us out, Hurley. Why did you give Kate the shampoo? And why didn't I get the peanut butter? Then, they'll get really mad and start asking: why does Hugo have everything -- why should he get to decide? [Quick intercuts between the gas station and storage room.] Then they'll all hate me. I don't know what to do.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jack on the beach.]
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Come on, Jack. The inventory's done, this is the only way.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you serious?
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, there's enough food in there to feed one guy, 3 meals a day for another 3 months. We have 40 people, it's just not going to work. You put me in charge, this is what we're doing.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[nodding] Okay.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Okay?
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, okay.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[to himself - relieved] Okay.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Montage of Hurley giving peanut butter to Charlie and passing out food; Locke sharing a tin; Shannon sharing with Vincent; Kate and Jack laughing and eating; baby smiling and Charlie giving the peanut butter to Claire; people patting Hurley on the back; Charlie and Hurley hugging; Sun burying the bottle of messages.]
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin, Sawyer, Michael; others talking in the background. The man who opened the door approaches Jin, Sawyer and Michael.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Um, excuse me. Hi. Back where you guys, uh, where you came from -- is there a woman named Rose there?
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Black chick in her 50's?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[nodding] Is she, is she okay?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, man, she's okay.
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh, oh.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Michael, I'm Michael.
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Thank you, Michael. I'm, I'm Bernard.
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Okay, it's okay. She's good.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Shot of Rose putting an Apollo bar in her pocket, holding Bernard's ring and smiling.]
