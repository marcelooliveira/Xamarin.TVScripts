4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Stephen Williams
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 13 Days Ago - (all the flashbacks in the episode are on-island). We see Locke putting guns away in the armory. Michael enters.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[whispering] John, John, I was hoping I could borrow one of these guns.
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is it supposed to be a secret?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Jack's asleep.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[handing him a rifle] More target practice?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Well, you know, just want to stay sharp. [Michael looks at his watch]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You got a date?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No. Old habits, you know.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes, I do.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Thanks, man. Hey, can I just get a couple of these bullets? I promise I won't...
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael drops a box of bullets on the floor.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Damn! I'm sorry...
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Naw, that's alright. I got it.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke bends down to get the bullets and Michael knocks him out with the butt of the rifle. Michael runs to the computer and starts typing but nothing is displayed.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Come on. Where are you?
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some random letters that Michael was typing appear and he backspaces over them. He starts typing again.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] You okay?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	ok, no time, come soon?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] I'm ready. Coming NOW. You said north -- north WHERE?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	when they take me out. there's huge rocks with a big HOLE in the middle by the beach. you'll know when you see.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] It's gonna be okay. I'm coming.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[speaking] I'm coming, Walt.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[in the background, off camera] Locke.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael blanks out the screen and grabs the rifle. Jack finds Locke lying unconscious in the armory.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	John.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[entering and cocking his gun] Stay in there. Stay.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Michael, what are you...
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Stay in there, Jack!
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, whatever's going on...
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son and nobody is going to stop me, okay. Okay, that is my right. That is a father's right.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael closes the vault door.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Today - Outside the Hatch we see Michael light a piece of paper on fire and watch it burn. Jack comes out of the Hatch.]
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey. What are you doing out here?
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Nothing. Just getting some air.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Come on. We should talk.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Ana and Libby's bodies covered with blankets on makeshift stretchers. Hurley, Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Michael are in the Hatch.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How many?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Rifles and pistols? 11 total.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's it?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's it. In case you forgot, they took 5 of 'em right off us.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How long would it take us to get to their camp?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We leave now, move fast? Middle of the night tomorrow. Look, they have no idea I know where they are. They won't be expecting us. So we get the guns and we go. Right now. Just the 5 of us.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, no, 5 is not enough. You said there's at least 20 of them. They've got our guns and we're not even sure if what you saw was...
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, I know I saw! We take too many people, they'll hear us coming. I'm not taking a damn army across the Island, Jack.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Michael, you sure you're in the best place to be making decisions for all of us right now?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You got a son, Jack?
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[angry] They're dead! Ana Lucia and Libby are dead. I mean, we haven't even buried them yet.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Hurley] Me and you will take Libby, okay. [to Kate] Can you?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, of course.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sawyer, would you?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[to Michael] You should stay here. We'll bury them tonight, then we'll figure out what's next.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They get the bodies and start to carry them out of the Hatch. Michael stares at a pool of Libby's blood on the floor.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 13 Days Ago - We see Michael running through the jungle. He stops to check his compass and continues running. He comes across a man peeing.]
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[shouldering his rifle] Hey, put your hands up. Put 'em up! Don't move.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Relax buddy. I ain't movin'. Why don't you just put that down...
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Shut up!
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	You're Walt's old man, aren't you?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly Tom is right behind Michael and takes the rifle. Michael breaks away and runs firing a pistol behind him. Pickett fires a couple of shots after him.]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What are you doing?! We need him.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tom throws a slingshot type strap that wraps around Michael's feet, tripping him.]
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Bag him quick. His friends are right behind us.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Today - We see Michael cleaning the blood from the floor of the Hatch. Eko enters.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Hello.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I didn't hear you come in, man.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I left my shoes outside. They were muddy.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Did you find him? Henry?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	No.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I hear you're a priest.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yes.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I guess you believe in hell, then.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[helping Michael clean the blood] For a brief time I served in a small parish in England. Every Sunday after Mass, I would see a young boy waiting in the back of the church. And then one day, the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said that the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek; and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that God would understand -- that he would be forgiven, as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness. He was only afraid that if he did go to hell -- that dog would be there waiting for him.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael walking through the jungle. He stops and throws up. Jack happens to walk by and see him.]
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, are you alright?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I was coming back to check on you.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, man. I had to get out of there. Just -- I have to get my son back.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're going to help you do that, Michael.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	But, it's got to be the way I said, man. Just the 5 of us. Otherwise, it won't work. It won't work.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I promise. We're going to figure that out.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No, I already have figured it out. It's got to be just the people who already know. You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley. That's it. Anybody else -- look, it puts him in more danger. You don't get to decide this. It's my son. It's my call. And that's the way it has to be.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Then that's the way it'll be.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Claire with Aaron at their tent. Charlie enters.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey. Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy. Hi. Have you seen Eko?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know, we're building a church.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Is there something you want, Charlie?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, I found something on the pallet I thought you might need.
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He takes a small case out of his pack and opens it revealing an injection device and some vials.]
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Vaccine?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know what we need a vaccine for, but I figured if anyone should have it, you and the baby should. [she doesn't respond] It's alright. It's a pneumatic injector. You just put into your leg [he demonstrates] and it goes right in. Quite painless, really.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You seem to know a lot about it.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I tried it. I wanted to make sure it was safe before giving it to you and the baby.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Well, how do you feel? I mean, did it do anything? What did it, what did it do?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I feel fine. Anyway, it says you're supposed to give yourself a shot every 9 days. Alright? So, there's enough here for you and the baby for a while. That's it. I'll put it -- I'll put it... [he puts it down].
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thank you.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Welcome.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I should really feed him.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. Hey, Claire, did you think that maybe you and I could...
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[seeing something over Charlie's shoulder] Oh my God! Michael's back.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sun and Jin on the beach. Sun looks up and sees Michael approaching.]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã«Â³Â´, Ã¬â€”Â¬ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«Ââ€ž. ...Michael?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin turns to see Michael and Jack approaching. He runs over and hugs him.]
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢Â¼! Ã«â€žË†Ã«Â¬Â´ Ã«Â°ËœÃªÂ°â€˜Ã«â€¹Â¤, ÃªÂ·Â¸ Ã«Ââ„¢Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã¬â€“Â¼Ã«Â§Ë†Ã«â€šËœ ÃªÂ±Â±Ã¬Â â€¢Ã­â€“Ë†Ã«Å â€Ã«ÂÂ°! ÃªÂ´Å“Ã¬Â°Â®Ã¬â€¢â€ž? Okay?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, yeah. It's good to see you, too.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[hugging him] Are you alright?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, I am. It's just -- I'm fine.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun looks over and notices Kate and Hurley are digging graves.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«Â¨Â¸Ã«â€šËœ! Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€“Â»ÃªÂ²Å’ Ã«ÂÅ“ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼? Who?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Ana Lucia and Libby.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢â€žÃ«â€¹Ë†, Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€“Â»ÃªÂ²Å’...?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What happened to them?
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They were murdered.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 13 Days Ago - We see Alex at a fire. Tom brings Michael in and takes the hood off his head.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Hey there, Michael. [Michael spits in his face.] Not going to hold that against you. Fair's fair. I took your boy. But don't do that again, okay.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where is he you son-of-a-bitch?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	[entering with Kate in a hood] Hey, look at what I found? She was following her friend about a half a click behind us.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	[to Michael] You make one sound you'll never see your boy again. [to Pickett] Gag him. Get ready with the torches. I'm going to talk to her people.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke, Sawyer and Jack in the jungle with torches. It's an edited version of the same scene we saw in The Hunting Party episode.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I think we'd better head back.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just find the trail, John.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I've lost the trail.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running through the jungle, toward the sounds of gunfire, because I don't care about Michael.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	You're exactly right, Jack.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke, Jack and Sawyer all have their guns drawn on Mr. Friendly.]
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who are you?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft. [Sawyer moves forward, looking like he's going to shoot.]
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Why don't you point the gun down?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer is suddenly shot, the bullet apparently grazing his ear or neck.]
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael and Kate reacting to the gunshots.]
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	It's okay. He's just delivering a message. He has to scare your friends to do it.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back to Jack and Mr. Friendly.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[smiling broadly] I don't believe you.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	You don't believe what?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I think there's more of us than there are of you.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	That's an interesting theory. [suddenly yelling and raising his arms] Light 'em up!
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Torches are suddenly lit and the group is surrounded by people just out of sight.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	I hoped it wouldn't come to this. [yelling] Bring her out, Alex!
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Alex looking hesitant.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Go on.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	You.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Come on, Alex.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Please?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	[to Kate] Let's go. Up. [he exits with Kate]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Is Claire okay? Did she have the baby? Is it okay? Is it a boy or a girl?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael looks confused, but can't respond because he's gagged. Back to Jack and Tom.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Like I said -- curiosity. [He pulls the bag off Kate's head.]
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Sawyer, and Locke throw their weapons down, disappointed.]
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Tom] You and me ain't done, Zeke.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tom grabs the guns and lets Kate go. The torches go out simultaneously. Tom walks away and goes back to where Michael and Alex are.]
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	His friends are going home. [He drops the guns on the ground] Divvy 'em up.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tom looks at Alex, and she hesitates.]
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	[to Michael] Sorry.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She knocks him out with her gun.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Today - We see Michael on the beach with Vincent.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Sawyer getting the guns from Sawyer's tent. Sawyer pulls a bottle of booze out of his stash.]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What do you say, Doc? [Jack looks at the bottle and goes back to collecting the guns] Here I was thinking the Irish drink when somebody dies. [he takes a drink]
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not Irish.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Neither am I. So what happened out there in the jungle?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Exactly what he said happened -- he found their camp...
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't talking about Mike. You and Freckles -- before you found him you all were gone all night.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We were caught in a net.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It means we got caught in a net.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Is that what they're calling it these days?
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack exits the tent and we see Sayid approaching.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Is it true -- Henry's gone?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Who's going after him?
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke and Eko went out in the middle of the night, but...
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	But we haven't seen either of them since.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[noticing what they're carrying] Those are the guns, aren't they? What are you doing with them?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What do you think we're doing? It's time to finish this.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	When do we leave?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	In the morning.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're not coming, Sayid.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Excuse me?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Michael wants to keep it small. Me, Kate, Hurley, and him.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well, him says even though Pippy Longstocking and the damn Grape Ape are ideal candidates for the Dirty Dozen -- I'm just going to say we might just want to bring the Red Beret.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's Michael's call. He knows where we're going.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[handing Sayid a gun] Welcome aboard.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eko walking in the Hatch. He sees his cross pulling from his chest toward as he walks by the magnet area. We hear the alarm start to beep. Eko goes to the computer room and enters the Numbers. Charlie enters.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, you wake up in the middle of the night; you grab your Jesus stick; you race off into the jungle. You don't call; you don't write?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I'm sorry. I had work to do.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right, yeah.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Charlie, would you do me a favor? I was hoping you could bring my things from the beach here.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What for? You moving in here? Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yes. I'm moving in here.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, what about the church? You said we were supposed to be building it together, man.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I am supposed to do something different now.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What am I supposed to do?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Bring me my things.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[exiting] Bring your own things.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Charlie, please.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You better leg it, mate. Clock's ticking.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The timer flips to 107:00.]
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael putting supplies in his pack. Sawyer enters.]
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Got some good news for you. Captain Arab's in too. Calvary rides at sunrise.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You told Sayid?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I told Sayid.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You shouldn't have done that!
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, well I'm sorry. I just figure if we going to war, we'd want the one guy who's actually been in a war. That a problem?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No, it's not a problem.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[exiting] Alright then.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 11 Days Ago - We see a group of the Others leading Michael, whose arms are tied behind his back. He trips and Pickett pulls him up hard.]
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Get up.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Get off of me!
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	You got a problem, Michael?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You march me day and night without any rest. Yeah, my problem is I'm tired.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	Well, I'd offer to knock you out and carry you, but we're here.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a large stone "wall" in the distance with a hole in it. Michael recognizes it as the landmark he was told to look for. They enter a camp with tent-like shelters and more Others, all dressed in raggedy clothes. We see two men with rifles standing guard in front of hatch doors. They pass people with fishing nets and we can see the ocean behind them.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	Put him right over here. [to Alex] Tell her we're here.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	I can't promise this won't hurt. [he jabs a needle in Michael's arm.]
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Ow, damn it!
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	Relax, just taking some blood.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Taking some blood for what? Who are you people? Where's my son?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PICKETT	That's it; all done. See you in the funny pages. [he exits]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A woman, Ms. Klugh, enters.]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Hello, Michael.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where's my son?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	My name is Ms. Klugh. I was hoping you might help me answer some questions. About Walt.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where is he?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Is he your biological son?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Are you his father?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yes, I'm his...
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	How old was he when he started speaking?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I, he...
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Did he have any illnesses growing up? Headaches? Fainting spells?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What? No! I don't -- I wasn't there. He was half way around the world. Why are you asking me all these questions?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Did Walt ever appear in a place he wasn't supposed to be? You say he was half way around the world -- did you see him?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I want my son! You bring him to me right now! I want to see my boy!
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	For someone who wants his son back so badly, you don't seem to know much about him, Michael.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Today - We see Sayid preparing his pack on the beach. Michael enters.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, you're not coming.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Welcome back, Michael.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Look, I know Sawyer told you, alright. But, it's not going to work. You're not coming.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And why is it that I'm not coming?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Because you're going after the guy that escaped. And I'm going after my son.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you implying I'd let a desire for revenge compromise Walt's safety?
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm implying that I decide who stays and who goes; and you stay. I know you want to help, right? But I've got to do this my way.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Of course. Good luck, Michael.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie working on building the church, but he drops the pole he's trying to lift into place.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Bloody hell.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He looks up to see Vincent running toward him carrying a Virgin Mary statue in his mouth which he then drops at Charlie's feet.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are you kidding me? Did someone put you up to this?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Vincent runs off and Charlie follows him to Sawyer's tent where he finds the rest of the statues.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie at the shore, throwing the statues into the ocean. He looks around to see Locke is sitting on the beach nearby, watching him.]
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack walking in the Hatch. He comes upon Eko at the computer.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You were supposed to come right back. You were out in the jungle all night. What happened?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	We were unable to find Henry's trail.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I got that. Where's Locke?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I do not know.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're burying Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Thank you. I will mourn them in my own way.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Sawyer preparing the guns.]
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Who's going to talk?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The funeral. Who's going to talk?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm sure Hurley will want to say something about Libby.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I never even knew her last name. Ana Lucia.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's Cortez.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Cortez, there you go. I screwed her.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's how she got my gun. Ana, she jumped me. [Jack looks puzzled] We got caught in a net.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why are you telling me this, Sawyer?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because you're about the closest thing I've got to a friend, Doc. And because she's gone. Well, at least now we get to kill to somebody.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley and Kate digging the graves. Michael approaches.]
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Jack fill you in on the plan?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What plan?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We're leaving first thing tomorrow -- back across the Island to their camp.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[to Hurley] What about you, man? You coming with us?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why would I want to go?
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Because they killed her!
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Michael, come on.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What do you say, Hugo?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm sorry about Walt, dude. But I'm not coming.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You're sorry...!
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Michael.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - 3 Day Ago - We see the Others' camp at night. Michael is being held inside one of the shelters. Ms. Klugh enters.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Dinner time.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	When are you going to do it?
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	When am I going to do what?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Kill me. I've seen where you live. I know how to get here. You have been asking me asking me questions I don't know the answer to for a week. I don't even think my son is alive.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	He is alive, Michael. He's standing outside right now.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What, do you think I'm stupid?
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	There's been a development since you came here, Michael. One of our people was captured by yours.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	So, go get him back.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	We can't do that. But you can. And if you do, we'll let you and Walt go free.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I want to see my son.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Michael...
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I want to see him! If he is out there you bring him in! You bring him in here right now!!
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	[calling out] Pickett! [to Michael] You have 3 minutes.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett brings Walt inside.]
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Let him go! Let him go! Get your hands off him, right now!
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad, don't.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Are you okay?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Yeah.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I just -- did they hurt you?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	They make me take tests.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They make you what?!
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	We're not going to talk about that.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	How's Vincent?
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Vincent, he's great. He's great. He misses you. Hey don't, don't, don't be scared, man. Don't be scared. It's going to be over real soon, okay? I'm going to get you out of here, okay?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	They're not who they say they are. They're pretending.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Walt! You want me to put you in the room again?
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Pretending? Pretending what?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	That's it. We're done.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No, wait. Hey wait, wait, wait. Come here, Walt. Wait, come here, Walt.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt breaks away from Pickett and runs and hugs Michael.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad, don't leave me. Help me, please! Don't leave me!
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I won't, man. I'm going to take -- I'm going to get you out of here. I promise you, I will get you out of here.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett grabs Walt.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad! Dad!
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Let him go! Walt wait! Let go of him!
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I love you!
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt, I'm going to get you out of here!
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I love you!
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt, I love you too, Walt!
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Let me go! Let me go!
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm going to get you out of here.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt is finally taken out, and Michael breaks down sobbing.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	After you release our man, I'm going to need you to do something else.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Whatever you want.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	I'm writing 4 names down -- 4 of your friends. We need you to bring them here. You have to bring only these 4 people, Michael. Just them. If you don't bring all the people on the list, you'll never see Walt again.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[still crying] Okay, okay.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Do you understand, Michael?
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[still crying] Yes. What do I tell them.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Doesn't matter. Make up a story. They'll be angry enough to believe whatever you say.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She hands him the list of names.]
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Who's James Ford?
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	You know him as Sawyer. You know the rest of them?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah. I know them. If I do all this -- if I do what you say...
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	You get your son back. You both go free.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Then I want the boat.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Today - We see people gathering at the beach for the funeral. We see Locke sitting on the beach nearby. He cuts loose the splint on his leg, shoulders his pack, and walks off in the other direction.]
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Sayid walking together toward the graves.]
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When the plane crashed I was on my way to Los Angeles to bury my dad.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm sorry to hear that.
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. It seems like such a long time ago now. I was going to go right from the airport to the cemetery but I had no idea what I was going to say. Here we are again.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I think Michael has been compromised. [Jack stops] Let's keep walking, Jack.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you mean "compromised"?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	His actions are not those of a man who is telling the truth.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why would he lie to us?
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Because I believe a father would do anything for his son. Because I believe Michael may have freed Henry. And because I believe he is leading you into a trap.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You believe a lot, Sayid.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I also believe that Henry was one of them.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright, let's go talk to him.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, he must continue to believe he's in control.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why the hell would we want to do that?
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	So we can create an advantage.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How?
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know yet. But we have one more night to figure that out.
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see everyone gathered around for the funeral service.]
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Ana Lucia Cortez was -- before we crashed she was a police officer. I don't think it was easy for her being here. But I think she did the best she could. She was a woman of few words, and I'm going to follow her example. Rest in peace, Ana.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Libby was -- she was -- she -- Libby was a psychologist, or psychiatrist -- one of those. Either way, she probably helped a lot of people. She helped me. She was my friend. It's not fair that this happened to her. It's not. [to Michael] I'm going with you. Goodbye, Libby.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire picks Charlie's hand.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun sees something on the water.]
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Boat. Boat!
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a sailboat coming in to shore.]
