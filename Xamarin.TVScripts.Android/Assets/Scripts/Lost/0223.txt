Live Together, Die Alone
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see everyone on the beach running toward shore, toward the boat.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are we rescued?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	REDSHIRT	Saved?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Perhaps it's them.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out toward the boat while the folks on the beach yell and look on. Kate looks through binoculars.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You see anything?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Maybe it's a trap?
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What do you mean a trap?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Sayid and Sawyer reach the boat and climb aboard. They hear music coming from below deck.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You hear that? [Jack nods]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly shots are fired from below. Then we can hear the trigger being pulled, but no shots being fired.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VOICE	[from below] Damn it.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack, Sayid and Sawyer kick in the door that leads below with their guns drawn. We see Desmond drunk and disheveled sitting on the floor.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You. [He laughs]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate with a group of redshirts around her, asking her questions.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Okay, okay, just wait one second, okay. I'll be right back. [She approaches Jack] Everybody needs to know what's going on, Jack. There's a boat...
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Just tell them Desmond's back until I find out the rest, okay.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack exits and approaches Desmond who's sitting near a fire, drinking.]
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So, before you ran off, I guess you just forgot to mention that you still have a sailboat. Why'd you come back?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[laughing] Do you think I did it on purpose? I was sailing for two and half weeks, bearing due West and making 9 knots. I should have been in Fiji in less than a week. But the first piece of land I saw wasn't Fiji, was it? No. No, it was here-this, this island. And you know why? Because this is it. This is all there is left. This ocean and this place here. We are stuck in a bloody snow globe! There's no outside world! There's no escape! So, just go away, huh. Let me drink.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid approaches and Jack gets ready to leave.]
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Are you still pushing it?
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, we're still pushing it.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond at a counter talking to a soldier in a prison. The soldier is taking items out of an envelope.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MASTER SERGEANT	Set of keys; one pocket watch, gold plated; one photograph (the same picture Desmond had in the Hatch); one book, Our Mutual Friend. Why didn't you bring that inside?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	To avoid temptation, brother. I've read everything Mr. Charles Dickens has ever written - every wonderful word. Every book except this one. I'm saving it so it will be the last thing I ever read before I die.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MASTER SERGEANT	Nice idea, as long as you know when you're going to die. [He stamps "discharged" on some papers] Lance Corporal Desmond David Hume your sentence is hereby complete and you are now and forever dishonorably discharged from the Royal Scotts Regiment of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. Long live the queen. Enjoy your sodding book.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Desmond exiting the garrison as a limo pulls up. A man, Charles Widmore, rolls down the window.]
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	You want a ride?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Not with you.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Get in the car.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond gets in and notices boxes on the seat.]
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Did you bring me a present?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Actually, two presents. One of these boxes contains your past, Hume. The other, your future. Go ahead, open it.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond opens a box and finds it filled with letters which are unopened and addressed to Penelope Widmore, sent by Desmond.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're a bastard, you know that?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	The fact that she never received your sentiments is good for her. Good, because as far as she's concerned you've forsaken her. And that's the way it's going to stay.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Is it now?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Penelope's moved on, Hume. She's getting married. [He opens the other box which is filled with money.] This is for your new life-away from my daughter. The conditions are simple-no contact, no calls, no posts. You just run away, Desmond.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	And what makes you think I would just run away?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Because you're a coward.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - We see Sayid and Jack walking on the beach.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	On the way to the funeral I told you that Michael had been compromised by the Others, and then you asked me how we might take advantage of that. I believe fate has given us our answer-the boat.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The boat?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This camp Michael is leading you to across the Island-that is where they will set their trap. While Michael leads you by land, I can approach far more quickly by sea. And I can go ashore undetected.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Go ashore and do what?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Scout them-their numbers and positions, their weapons. Then I'll go to the nearest beach and start a signal fire with these [he holds up some leaves]. They burn with a dark, black smoke. You and your team will come to meet me at the signal and we will go in together.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're not even sure if Michael's been turned by them.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	He has been turned.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll have to tell Kate, and Hurley and Sawyer what we're doing.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No. Michael cannot sense we know he is lying. All we have is the element of surprise, Jack. Right now it's only your responsibility to keep it secret.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Black smoke, huh?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	This time they will know that we are coming.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke enter the Hatch and approach Eko. The timer is at 5:00 minutes.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Hello, John. Where have you been?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I've been thinking.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	About what?
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That in a minute that computer's going to start beeping, and when it does you're going to let it go. You're going to let it run down to zero, past zero. And you're not going to push the button.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	But I am going to push the button. Why wouldn't I?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because you don't want to be a slave.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I am a slave to nothing.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're a slave to that [pointing to the timer clock], just like I was. So I'm going to tell you again-don't push it.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Do not tell me what I can do.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko starts entering the Numbers. Locke grabs his stick and tries to smash the computer but Eko stops him and they struggle.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You cannot push that button.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko knocks Locke to the ground, pushes the button and starts leading Locke out of the Hatch.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, it's not real. We're only puppets-puppets on strings. As long as we push it, we'll never be free.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[pushing him out of the Hatch] Well, you're free now, John. Do not come back.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack give Michael a gun. He tries to give one to Hurley.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No way. I'm not even going to kill someone.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Ain't that the point?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I thought the point was to get Walt back?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hands Kate a gun. She looks pensive.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What's the matter?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	All that stuff we found in the medical station-costumes, make-up, fake beards-what if these people just want us to think they're hillbillies?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Listen, I was there. I saw them. They are hillbillies. They live in huts; they eat fish; they're probably more scared than we are. And they have no idea we're on our way.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alright, enough jibber-jabber, let's roll.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid approach Desmond on the beach.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I need your boat.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I wouldn't waste your time. There's nothing out there, pal.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm not going out there. I need to get to the North shore of the Island, and quickly.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Going to see the hostiles, are you?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You know what, ignorance is bliss. The boat's all yours, brother, for all the good it'll do you.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know how to sail.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Then I suggest you find someone who does.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond at a coffee bar counter.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Just give me which ever one has the most caffeine in it, brother. [he opens his wallet] Damn, um, I'm sorry. I've just arrived and I spent all my American money on a taxi.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	[putting money on the counter] I've got it.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	That's not necessary.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	It's just 4 bucks.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I don't suppose you have 42,000 more of those do you?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Depends on what it's for.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I was joking.
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	No you weren't.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Libby and Desmond sitting with each other. Libby is looking at a brochure for a sailing race. There's a picture of Widmore on the brochure.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	So, a sailing race around the world?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I have 8 months to get into the best shape of my life. I'll tell you what, miss, I'm going to win.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	And what do you get if you do?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What really matters is who I win it for. [he pushes the brochure toward her]
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	[looking at the brochure] Charles Widmore.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	He tried to buy me off. And when I didn't take his money, he took away the only thing in the world that I ever truly cared about.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Who is she?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	His daughter. I was unsuitable on several levels.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	And what's the 42 grand for?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It's a wee bit complicated. As of yet, I don't actually have a boat. [Libby looks sad] Sorry, did I say something wrong?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I have a boat. It was my husband's but he got sick. He wanted to sail the Mediterranean-he never-he passed away about a month ago.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm sorry.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	I want you to have it.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I can't take your boat, miss.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	But you have to. He'd want you to.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What was your husband's name?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	David.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	And what did he name his boat?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIBBY	Elizabeth. He named it after me.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Then I thank you, Elizabeth. And I shall win this race for love.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Back on the beach, we see Jin approach Sun and Sayid.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â­ÂÃ«ÂÂ¼Ã«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼?
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[to Sayid] Would you excuse us, please?
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'll be at the shore.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã«Â°Â°Ã«Â¡Å“ Ã¬â€šÂ¬Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«â€œÅ“Ã«Â¥Â¼ Ã¬â€žÂ¬ Ã«Â°ËœÃ«Å’â‚¬Ã¬ÂªÂ½Ã¬Å“Â¼Ã«Â¡Å“ Ã«ÂÂ°Ã«Â Â¤Ã«â€¹Â¤ Ã¬Â£Â¼ÃªÂ¸Â°Ã«Â¥Â¼ Ã¬â€ºÂÃ­â€¢Â´Ã¬Å¡â€.

256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael, Sawyer, Jack, Hurley and Kate walking through the jungle. Sawyer sees a doll and starts to reach for it, but Kate stops him.]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't even think about it. It's a trap-a net. Rousseau's got them all over the Island.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How the hell would you know that?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I tripped one with Jack. We ended up-never mind. [Sawyer chuckles] What?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	When the Doc told me you all got caught in a net I thought he meant, uh-something else.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Since when did you and Jack start talking about me?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear some rustling in the bushes. A big bird swoops down over them and screeches. Michael tries to shoot, but his gun doesn't fire.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did that bird just say my name?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, it did. Right before it crapped gold.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael looking at his gun to see if there's something wrong. Jack notices.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sorry, man. I guess I forgot to load that one. Want to give me the mag?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie walking through the jungle. He comes across Locke who is crying.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	John. [Locke pulls himself together and turns] What happened to your face?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nothing, I'm fine.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, uh, if you're feeling a little sorry for yourself you may want to have a drink with your mate from the Hatch. I hear he's a little despondent, as well.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, that's right; you weren't there for the dramatic arrival at the funeral. I think he's pushed your button too many times, if you ask me.
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Desmond?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, Desmond. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid preparing an inflatable raft with supplies and a gun, to take the sailboat. Jin and Sun approach.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm sorry if what I said was confusing, but I asked Jin to come.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	You need someone to translate. And you need at least two people who know how to sail.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Desmond managed by himself.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	And look where he ended up.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Claire getting ready to give Aaron an injection.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[off camera at first] You're wasting your time, sister. I shot myself with that stuff every 9 days for 3 years. [he looks at Aaron] He's lovely. Is the father here on the Island?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No. Nope, he's been gone a long time. Sort of walked off the moment he got a bit scared by the situation.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad-thought he was doing what was best for you.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	He was doing what was best for him.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond at the stadium getting ready to run. A car pulls up and Jack gets out and heads to the steps. Another car pulls up and a woman gets out.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How did you find me?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	The landlord at your flat told me you ran here everyday.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How did you find me?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	I have a lot of money, Desmond. With enough money and determination you can find anyone. Did you read your beloved book-the one you were saving?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Not yet.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	I thought you might have read it while you were away.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I was in prison, not away.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	Why didn't you write to me?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	When are you getting married, Pen?
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	We haven't set a date yet.
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'll be back in a year.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	What if you were back, right now?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm going to win this race, Pen-his race. And in a year, I'll be back.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	Desmond, what are you running from?
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I have to get my honor back, and that's what I'm running to.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Locke approaches the still drinking Desmond on the beach.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So what did one snowman say to other snowman?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Smells like carrots.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello, Desmond.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hello yourself, box man.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[reaching for the bottle] Do you mind?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh, I insist. So you managed to fix the computer, then, did you?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	World's still here, ain't it?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm not so sure about that, brother.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Refresh my memory, Desmond. How long did you say that you were down there in the Hatch?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	3 years.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Desmond, what if I told you that for all that-all those years that you and all the men before you were down there pushing that button-what if I told you that it was all for nothing?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I found another hatch-another station on the Island. They called it the Pearl, and I saw a film there-an orientation film. And it said that everything that was happening in our hatch wasn't real-that it was a test-a psychological experiment.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're lying.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke reaches in his pack and pulls out the Pearl video.]
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You want to take a walk? I'll make the popcorn.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're so sure it's not real, then just stop pushing the button!
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, I have. Except, unfortunately, someone else decided to start. So you're going to sober up. We're going to get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow we're going to find out what happens if that button doesn't get pushed.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley and Sawyer around a fire.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	DHARMA nutri-bar?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No thanks; I'm not hungry.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You serious?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley gives him a dirty look.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael by himself, agonizing. Jack approaches.]
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, you alright?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, just getting some more firewood. Not feeling too hot.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll give you a hand.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, thanks for coming out here-risking your neck for my boy.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Live together, die alone, man.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid, Jin and Sun on the sailboat. Sun throws up over the side.]
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€šÂ´ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã¬ËœÂ¤Ã¬Â§â‚¬ Ã«Â§ÂÃ«ÂÂ¼ÃªÂ³ Ã­â€“Ë†Ã¬Å¾â€“Ã¬â€¢â€ž. [Subtitle: I told you not to come. ]

414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢Å’Ã¬â€¢â€ž. Ã«Â³Â´Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã¬Â¤â€ž ÃªÂ²Å’ Ã¬Å¾Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´. [Subtitle: I know. There's something you should see. ]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He points to the shore, and we see the foot and calf of one leg of what was once a giant statue.]
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't know what is more disquieting-the fact that the rest of the statue is missing, or that it has 4 toes?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[In the Hatch, we see Eko carving another bible verse into his stick. The lights suddenly go out. Eko investigates and finds a fuse is missing from the fuse box. The loudspeaker starts counting down: 8, 7, 6. We see Eko and Desmond in the computer room. Desmond is rubbing two bare wires together causing the blast doors to come down and locking Eko outside the computer room. Eko jams his stick under the blast door just before it goes down, but Locke grabs it.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[banging on the door] John!
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[to Desmond] Neat trick.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[banging] John! John! Can you hear me? Open up.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Are you sure about this, brother?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm more sure about this than anything in my entire life.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[banging] Don't do this! John!
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Alright then, box man. We wait.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond on the sailboat in a terrible storm. He goes below deck and wraps his Dickens book in plastic and puts it in his coat. He goes back on deck, falls, and is knocked out. Next we see him washed up on shore. We see a blurry, jumpy sequence of a man in a yellow environmental suit drag Desmond back to the Hatch. We see that the man is Inman, the CIA operative from Sayid's flashbacks.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Are you him?
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What?
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	What did one snowman say to the other?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What are you talking about? Who are you?
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	I'm Inman. Kelvin Inman.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What, what happened to my boat?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	I found you washed up on the beach. There was no boat.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear the alarm start to sound. Inman enters the Numbers.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What was all that about, then?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Just saving the world.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Desmond watching the Orientation Film.]
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MARVIN CANDLE	Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed: every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The film reel ends there, and Desmond takes it off the projector.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	[donning his environmental suit] How many times are you going to watch that thing?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why are there missing parts?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Radzinsky made some edits.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Who's Radzinsky?
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	He was my partner.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	And what happened to him?
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Just make sure you put that back behind Turn of the Screw when you're done with it.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why do you wear that suit?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	So I don't get infected out there. [he grabs an injector and vaccine] Give yourself a shot of this every 9 days. You were out there a while before I found you. Hope it's not too late.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Back in the Hatch, we hear Eko still banging on the blast door.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	John!
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Who is he, box man-the man out there pounding on the door?
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	His name is Mr. Eko.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why does Mr. Eko carry around a stick covered in scripture?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because he's a priest.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Open the door, please. John! Can you hear me? Open up.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We locked out a priest?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eko climb up out of the Hatch door entrance. He sees the quarantine sign and runs toward the beach. We see Charlie playing guitar. Eko approaches.]
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Charlie, do you know how they got the Hatch door open?
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, but if you hum it, I could probably play it.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	How did they open it-the door that says "quarantine"?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	They blew it up, why?
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Charlie, I need your help.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, now I'm back in your good graces, Father?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Charlie, John has locked me out of the Hatch. And I believe he is doing this because he is going to stop pushing that button. And, Charlie, I am absolutely certain that if he is successful, in 90 minutes everyone on this island will die.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Alright, I'm in. I'm in.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Thank you. Come, come quickly.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and company walking through the jungle.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	So, these Others, you think they're left over from the DHARMA folk?
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I don't know, man.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	My theory, they're aliens. That's why they use the fake beards-their heads are made of pathetic.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Prosthetic, dude.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You can't even spell and now you're correcting me? What do you think, Freckles?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Just keep moving, we're being followed.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[stopping to pretend to tie her shoe] Just keep smiling. There's at least two of them across the river. In about 5 seconds I'm going to turn the tables on them. [she pulls her gun out]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Wait a second.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You in?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Sawyer starts shooting. Sawyer hits one and the other one runs.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's getting away!
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and the rest rush to the guy Sawyer shot.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's dead. We have to find the other one.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No!
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm going. Sawyer.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I said no!
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Are you crazy?! We let him go they'll know we're coming! He'll...
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It doesn't matter if we catch him now! [Sawyer and Kate stare at him like he's crazy. Jack looks at Michael] They've already been warned.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What do you mean "warned"?
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why don't you tell them, Michael?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I don't know what you're talking about.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Stop lying! Tell them.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Tell them what?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[pushing Michael up against a tree] I know what you're doing, Michael! Now tell them the truth! Tell them!
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It was the only way. They gave me a list.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What list?
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It had your names on it. I had to bring all 4 of you back, or they said I'd never see my son again!
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Who are they?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It's like I said-they live in a camp with huts. I swear, that's it.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You let Henry go?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael nods.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did you kill them? Ana Lucia and Libby? Did you?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I had to, man. I, God, I couldn't find any other way. And Libby was a mistake. I, I didn't have time to think.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	But if you did have time-you still would have killed her, right?
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm sorry. You understand-I am sorry. I'm sorry. I-my son!
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm going back.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, Hurley. Hurley, you can't!
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We're all going to get killed and you knew it! You let us come anyway.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's too late to go back now, Hurley. We already caught them following us once. If they don't believe that we trust Michael, they'll kill us all! I'm sorry that I didn't say anything. But you have to know that I would never bring you out here if I didn't have a plan.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What plan?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid praying on the boat.]
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Prays in Arabic.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin sees something on the shore.]
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sayid! Here.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid looks through the binoculars and sees the rock wall with the hole in it.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	That's the rock Michael described. We're here.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie and Eko walking in the jungle.]
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Hurry, please.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hurley showed me. It's around here somewhere. It's definitely around, uh...
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	We're running out of time, Charlie.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Here it is! Told you. Careful. Careful. Dynamite is very unstable. You don't want to end up like Dr. Arzt.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie and Eko enter the Hatch.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Careful. Eko, hey, Eko. Listen, what if we hurt them? Or blow up the computer?
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You can leave now, Charlie.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	John, it's Charlie. Let's work this thing out, John. John! Eko is very upset, John. Just open this door and we can talk about it. John, you should know Eko is going to blow open the blast door.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Blow it open with what?
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	With dynamite from the old ship in the jungle.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It would take an atom bomb, brother. Tell him not to bother.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're sure it'll hold?
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye, I'm sure.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond moving a cart under a blast door. Inman pours some detergent into a measuring cup and stirs it with a paint brush.]
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Maybe you should do it?
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Come on, Des, you've seen me do it a hundred times.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond hits the bare wires together to make the blast doors come down. We hear the loudspeaker counting down: 6, 5, 4; and see the blast door come down on the cart, leaving a big enough space to crawl under.]
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How do you even remember where you left off from?
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly. You should have seen Radzinsky do this. He had a photographic memory. I mean, this whole baby was his idea.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Yeah, right, Radzinsky. Radzinsky figured out how to fake a lockdown. Radzinsky created this great invisible map. More and more tales about your former partner. Yet for some reason, you never want to tell me what bloody well happened to him.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inman walks over to Desmond and points to a spot on the ceiling.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	See that brown stain, there? That's Radzinsky. He put a shotgun in his mouth when I was asleep. The bitch of it was, I only had a 108 minutes to bury the poor bastard.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well, if you don't want me to go crazy, next time let me go out.
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Well, you want to go out there with the quarantine and the hostiles?
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I haven't been outside for 2 bloody years! Yes, I want to go! I was in the army for God's sake!
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Oh, right, Her Majesty's Army, correct? Tell me, Desmond, why'd you leave that nice old lady's army? Oh, I remember now. You got kicked out because you couldn't follow orders.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why did you leave your army, Kelvin, huh?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Because men followed my orders. Ah, but then thank God I joined the DHARMA Initiative. Namaste, thank you, and good luck. [he laughs]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Please, Kelvin. Let me go out, huh? Just once.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Sorry, Des. You stay here. You push the button. That's an order.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Back at the Hatch, we see Charlie banging on the blast door.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	John! Seriously, you're about to be detonated.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eko rigging the dynamite.]
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to Eko] Hey, what if John's right. What if it's just some colossal joke? You know, it's just some old computer connected to nothing? Maybe it's just a bunch of wires?
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko suddenly pounces on Charlie and shoves him up against a wall. He rips his belt off, and throws it at the magnet wall where it sticks.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Is that a joke?
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'll see myself out.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko goes back to the dynamite. Charlie grabs his belt from the wall.]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	John, this is your last time to end this. Open the door, and I will forgive you.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Forgive me for what?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko gets ready to light the fuse.]
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, hey, Eko. Wait. Just wait a second. I don't think it's a good idea, Eko. [Eko lights the fuse] We're in a very confined area.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko pushes himself up against a wall. Charlie starts running.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, bollocks.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[There's a huge explosion and a fire ball that chases Charlie to the end of the hall.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We hear the alarm sound and see Desmond wake up.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Kelvin! Hey, Kelvin.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond runs to the computer and enters the Numbers. Desmond hears Kelvin singing and sees a bottle of booze on the floor. He opens a grate on the floor and finds Kelvin drunk under the Hatch holding a key dangling from a chain.]
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond makes his way over to Kelvin who is lying next to a small alcove. We see a lid has been opened to reveal a place to insert the key and a sign that says Caution: System Termination.]
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What is this?
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	This is the only other way out, partner.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What are you talking about?
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Failsafe. Turn this key and this all goes away.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What's behind that wall, Kelvin? Huh? What was the incident?
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Electromagnetism, geologically unique. The incident-there was a leak. So now the charge builds up and every time we push the button it discharges it before it gets too big.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why make us do it-push the button? If we, if we can just...
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	[laughing and closing the lid] Here's the real question, Desmundo-do you have the courage to take your finger out of the dam and blow the whole thing up, instead?
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Back in the Hatch.]
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I think your friends just blew themselves up, brother.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They're not my friends.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I can't hear anything. Maybe we should open it.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, no; it's a trick.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	A trick? They could be hurt? Is your doctor around?
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Our doctor is God knows where. And he sure as hell doesn't care about anything happening down here.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Can I ask you a question, brother?
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Absolutely.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Is the reason you're letting that clock there run all the way down to the very last tick-is it because you need to look down the barrel of a gun to find out what you really believe, John?
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I looked down the barrel of the gun and I believed. I thought it was my destiny to get into this place. And someone died-a kid. Because he was stupid enough to believe that I knew what I was talking about. And the night that he died for nothing, I was sitting right up there, all alone, beating my hand bloody against that stupid door-screaming to the heavens asking what I should do. And then a light went on. I thought it was a sign. But it wasn't a sign. Probably just you going to the bathroom.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond has a look of recognition on his face, and turns away.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Sayid sneaking up to the Other's camp from the beach. He sneaks up to one of the shelters and looks inside but no one is there. No one is at the camp at all. He opens the door of the Hatch, but there is just rock wall behind it.]
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and company walking through the jungle. Kate sees something.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They discover a huge pile of canisters, each with a notebook in it, piled on the ground. We see that the pneumatic tubing runs up out of the ground and has been spitting the canisters out in the middle of the jungle. Kate inspects them.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What are they?
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's handwritten. It's all filled, the whole book. They're journal entries.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer picks up a piece of paper from on top of the pile and finds Locke's map.]
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[reading from the notebook] 0400: S.R. moves ping-pong table again. 0415: Takes a shower. What is this?
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[spotting something in the distance] Hey, Doc, what did you say Sayid's signal's going to be when the coast is clear to hit that beach party?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a column of black smoke.]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That means he found them, right?
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's miles from here. [to Michael] Where were you taking us?
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sayid said that he'd light the signal so that we could meet him at the shore. Why aren't we going to the beach?
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We are headed to the beach.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're nowhere near the beach!
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Look, I had to.
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?!
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hear whispers, then Sawyer gets hit in the neck with a dart and falls to the ground convulsing.]
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer!
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Run!!! Go, go!
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Jack start running. Hurley crouches and covers his head. Michael stands there.]
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Wait!
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate gets hit with a dart. Jack fires into the bushes and picks Kate up. He gets hit with a dart and falls. We see some Others come to collect them.]
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Desmond and Locke in the Hatch.]
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Tell me about this other hatch you found-this Pearl.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What do you want to know?
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Details.
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The Pearl is a psychological station full of TV monitors. And two men sat in viewing chairs and filled notebooks with observations on what happens in here. And then they put the notebooks in pneumatic tubes and send them back to their headquarters so they could evaluate us-as an experiment. [Desmond looks concerned, confused] What?
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What if you've got it backwards?
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Backwards?
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What if the experiment wasn't on the two men in here, but on the two men in there? I want to see that tape, John?
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, you can't. There's no way to see it down here.
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well, was there anything else in that station? Was there a computer?
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yeah.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So what did it do?!
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Nothing! It didn't do anything. It printed out numbers. Lots and lots of numbers.
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What printout, where is it?
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Here, reading material for the next 19 minutes. Knock yourself out.
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond shaving.]
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	You've been shaving everyday for the last 3 years. You need to live a little, let go.
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm never going to let go, brother.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	[zipping his environmental suit] Oh, that's the spirit. Bye, Des.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Goodbye?
846	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Yeah, goodbye. See you in a couple hours.
848	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond notices a big tear in the leg of the environmental suit. He watches Inman leave, and put the gas mask on. He follows him outside and sees him take off the mask.]
850	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Desmond following Inman along a rock shore. Suddenly Inman is gone. Desmond sees his sailboat in the water.]
852	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	[from behind Desmond] Well, gosh, I didn't think you had the stones to come after me. I was a spook for 10 years, Des. I know when I'm being followed.
854	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What are you doing with my boat?
856	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	I'm fixing it.
858	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You were leaving?
860	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Well, I mean, not yet. It's still about a week away. You wrecked it pretty good, Des. What do you think? Want to come with me?
862	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Come where?! What about the button?!
864	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Screw the button, man. Who knows if it's even real?
866	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	That's not what you said when you were going on and on about dams and electromagnetics and failsafes!
868	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Well, I was drunk.
870	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Why did you lie to me?!
872	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	I lied to you because I needed a sucker to save the world after I left!
874	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You crazy old bastard! You stole my life!!
876	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	INMAN	Oh, come on.
878	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What else did you lie to me about?! What else? Tell me?!
880	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond has Inman by the collar and they fall to ground. Inman gets up and Desmond rushes him, falling on top of him. Inman hits his head.]
882	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How could you do this to me?! Get up.
884	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sees blood coming from the back of Inman's head and realizes he's dead.]
886	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Oh my God. Oh my God.
888	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond grabs the failsafe key from around Inman's neck and runs back to the Hatch.]
890	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond arrives to hear the loudspeaker repeating: System Failure over and over; the whole hatch is shaking. We see that the hieroglyphs on the timer are all locked in place. Desmond is frantically trying to enter the Numbers, but the screen is filled with System Failure over and over again. We see everything metal in the Hatch flying in the air toward the magnet wall area. Finally, Desmond somehow enters the Numbers and the timer resets. The screen blanks and we see the >: caret.]
892	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Back in the Hatch, Desmond is looking over the print out from the Pearl station.]
894	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What are you doing?
896	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	When did you come here?
898	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
900	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	The Island-when did you come here? How long ago?
902	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	60-65 days.
904	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	The date-what was the date?
906	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	September 22nd.
908	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see numbers on the printout: 922044:16, followed by System Failure printed over and over.]
910	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It was September 22nd.
912	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I think I crashed your plane.
914	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the Others leading Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley down a long pier, making them kneel when they near the end. Michael is walking freely. Their hoods are taken off, and we see they are gagged.]
916	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[through the gag] Son-of-bitch...
918	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pickett knees him in the stomach.]
920	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	Everybody just calm down.
922	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[through the gag, to Mr. Friendly] It's fake. I know that your beard is fake.
924	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	Sorry, missy, I didn't get you.
926	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	She says she's knows your beard's fake, Tom.
928	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	[removing the beard] Well, thanks for pointing that out, Kate. I can't tell you how much this thing itches. And thanks for telling them my name, Bea.
930	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the boat that we saw in Exodus arrive at the pier. Henry Gale gets out and is obviously the one in charge. He strides up to Jack.]
932	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Hello again. [to Mr. Friendly] Where's your beard?
934	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. FRIENDLY	I think they know.
936	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	[to Michael] Alright, let's take care of business, shall we?
938	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie regaining consciousness in the Hatch. The sound is muddy with a ringing tone to simulate Charlie's hearing loss from the blast. He gets up and finds Eko lying unconscious and bloody on the ground a little ways away.]
940	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Eko? Eko! It's Charlie. Wake up.
942	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke and Desmond in the computer room.]
944	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We need to push the button.
946	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, we don't!
948	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Do you not hear me, brother? I crashed your bloody plane?
950	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How did you manage to do that?
952	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	On that day, those numbers turned to hieroglyphics. And when the last one came down this whole started to shake! And that screen? That screen filled up with "system failure," [pointing to the printout] System Failure! And I know what they are. 92204-September the 22nd, 2004, the day your planed crashed! It's real! It's all bloody real!! Now, push the damn button!!
954	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I know what I saw! It's a lie; it's not real! None of it is real!
956	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You don't want to push the button? Then I will.
958	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No!
960	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke grabs the computer and smashes it on the floor. Desmond looks horrified. There's about 3 minutes on the timer.]
962	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You killed us. You killed us all.
964	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No. I just saved us all.
966	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond opens the blast doors. And starts going through the bookcase.]
968	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, Eko, wake up. [to Desmond] Hey, can I get some help? Can you help me?
970	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm trying, brother.
972	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond finds his copy of Our Mutual Friend.]
974	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Desmond in the Hatch, holding a gun. He's finishes off a bottle of booze, and opens the Dickens book. A letter slips out. We hear a VO of Penelope reading the letter.]
976	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	Dearest Des, I am writing this letter to you as you leave for prison. And I've hidden in the one place you would turn to in a moment of great desperation. I know you go away with the weight of what happened on your shoulders. And I know the only person who can ever take it off is you. Please don't give up, Des. Because all we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you, Pen.
978	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond sobs and throws the bottle.]
980	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It's all gone. It's all gone!!
982	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He starts pulling all the books out of the bookshelf and throwing them. Suddenly, he hears banging and hears something which turns out to be Locke from the night Boone died.]
984	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[from outside] I've done everything you wanted me to do? Why did you do this?! Why?!
986	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond turns the light on in the Hatch. He laughs.]
988	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Back in the Hatch Desmond opens his Dickens book and finds the failsafe key. We see the timer at 29 seconds. Desmond rushes to open the grate and get to the failsafe.]
990	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	3 days before you came down here, before we met, I heard a banging on the Hatch door, shouting. But it was you, John, wasn't it? You said there isn't any purpose-there's no such thing as fate. But you saved my life, brother, so that I could save yours.
992	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, no, no, none of this is real! Nothing is going to happen. We're going to be okay.
994	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see 5 seconds left on the timer.]
996	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I've got to go. And you've got to get as far away from here as possible.
998	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Go where?! Stop!
1000	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'm going to blow the dam, John. [the timer starts flipping to the hieroglyphs] I'm sorry for whatever happened that made you stop believing. But it's all real. Now I've got to go and make it all go away.
1002	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Wait, Desmond.
1004	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'll see you in another life, brother.
1006	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the last hieroglyph lock in place. The loudspeaker starts announcing System Failure over and over. Everything starts shaking. We see Charlie trying to help Eko.]
1008	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Eko! Eko! Wake up! Can you move? Okay, come on.
1010	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Knives and forks start flying toward the magnet wall, with Charlie and Eko in their path. Everything metal in the place starts flying toward the magnet wall. Charlie helps Eko walk. Desmond makes it to the failsafe mechanism.]
1012	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Eko, on your feet.
1014	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Charlie.
1016	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No.
1018	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko pushes Charlie away and knocks him to the ground. Eko heads back toward the computer room. The washing machine comes barreling toward Charlie as he rolls out of the way.]
1020	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	John!
1022	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I was wrong.
1024	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Desmond cross himself and insert the key. We hear Penelope as a VO, reading again.]
1026	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PENELOPE	All we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you.
1028	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[turning the key] I love you, Penny.
1030	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The screen fades to white.]
1032	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Gale and everyone on the pier. The ground shakes, there's a bright light and a strange sound, and everyone covers their ears. We see Sayid, Sun and Jin on the boat, covering their ears. We see the people on the beach reacting the same way. The light and sound fade. We see an object falling from the sky. Bernard moves Claire to safety, right before the Hatch door with the quarantine stencil almost falls on them.]
1034	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see people cleaning up the food "pantry" at the beach. Charlie arrives out of the jungle.]
1036	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Charlie, are you okay?
1038	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's hard to tell exactly. But, my ears, you know?
1040	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Where's Locke-Eko?
1042	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	They're not back yet?
1044	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie sees Claire and smiles.]
1046	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Gale and Michael at the pier.]
1048	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	I'm not happy about the arrangement that was made with you Michael, but we got more than we bargained for when Walt joined us, so I suppose this is what's best. And you let me go, set me free-you lived up to your word. We live up to our word, too. Do you know how to drive a boat?
1050	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, I can drive a boat.
1052	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Good, then you're going to take this boat and follow a compass bearing of 325, and if you do that exactly, you and your son will find rescue.
1054	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	That's it? I follow the bearing and me and my son get rescued?
1056	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Yes.
1058	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	How do you know I won't tell people about where I was?
1060	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Maybe you will, maybe you won't. But it won't matter. Once you leave, you'll never be able to get back here. And my hunch is you won't say a word to anybody because if you do, people will find out what you did to get your son back.
1062	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	My friends-I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.
1064	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	A deal's a deal.
1066	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Who are you people?
1068	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	We're the good guys, Michael. Alright, she's all yours.
1070	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What? What, am I stupid? Where's my son?!
1072	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Walt's inside.
1074	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael runs to the boat.]
1076	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Bon voyage, Michael.
1078	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt!
1080	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad! Dad!
1082	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Come here, come here [they hug]. You okay?
1084	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Yeah.
1086	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You sure? Okay, I've got you now. It's going to be okay now. We're going home, Walt. We are going home.
1088	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Gale motions to Ms. Klugh and she removes Hurley's gag.]
1090	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Hugo, you can go back to your camp.
1092	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What?
1094	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Go back. Your job is to tell the rest of your people they can never come here.
1096	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	But what about my friends?
1098	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GALE	Your friends are coming home with us.
1100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MS. KLUGH	Go.
1102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks to Jack who nods for him to leave. Michael takes off in the boat and the hoods are put back on Sawyer, Jack, and Kate.]
1104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie and Claire sitting by a fire at the beach.]
1106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What happened out there, Charlie?
1108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You want to hear the part about me nearly being killed by the flaming fireball-or the flying fork?
1110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I want you to be serious.
1112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Nothing happened.
1114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Well, something happened. I mean that noise, and the sky turned that weird violet color.
1116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Did it?
1118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire turns away exasperated and Charlie smiles. Claire examines a wound on Charlie's arm.]
1120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ow, ow.
1122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire kisses him.]
1124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The scene suddenly switches to a landscape of snowy peaks in blizzard conditions. The camera pulls back to reveal that it's a shot through a window. We see the inside of a fairly small shelter filled with equipment and laundry hanging from lines. One man is getting coffee while another man waits at a chess board. Man #1 kicks something.]
1126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN #1	Quem quebrou isso, hein?

1132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN #2	Ah, entÃƒÂ£o seu plano deve ser perder. Agora, por favor. [Subtitle: Ah. Then your plan must be to lose. Please. Your move.]
1134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Man #1 looks over a piece of equipment. We can see a screen that says Electromagnetic Anomaly Detected.]
1136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN #2	O quÃƒÂª? [Subtitle: What?]
1138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN #1	HÃƒÂ¡ quanto tempo tÃƒÂ¡ fazendo isto? [Subtitle: How long has it been doing that?]
1140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Man #2 goes over to the equipment and hurriedly looks through a book.]

1146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[An alarm starts beeping and Man #2 goes to a computer screen.]

1150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN #2	Cala a boca e chama ajuda!! [Subtitle: Just shut up and call!!]
1152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a bedroom nightstand and hear the phone on it ringing.]

1156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN #1	Ms. Widmore?
