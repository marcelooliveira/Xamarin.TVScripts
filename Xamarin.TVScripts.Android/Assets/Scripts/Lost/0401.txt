The Beginning of the End
2	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Written by	Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse
4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Jack Bender
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - A pile of fruit is shown with an ocean backdrop. The pile appears to explode as a car drives through it, and we see that the backdrop is in fact merely a picture, the scene is a city. The car drives erratically as police cars pursue. In a house, a man turns on a television, which shows live coverage of the high-speed chase on the news. The man watches the action whilst pouring himself a drink.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NEWSREADER	Almost 30 minutes now since the start of this high-speed chase. We still have no information about who's driving this vehicle. Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JEFF	We're getting reports that the pursuit began near the La Brea area, then travelled to a warehouse in the district south of the ten freeway.
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NEWSREADER	Can you see how many people are in the car?
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man watching the television is revealed to be Jack.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JEFF	It would appear to be just the one, the driver. We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. What you're seeing here are pictures of the ten freeway, south of downtown.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NEWSREADER	Is that a Camaro, Jeff?
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JEFF	Yes, yes it looks like a vintage early 70's model.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Damn it.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The car is surrounded by police vehicles and veers off the road, crashing. The police cars stop nearby and officers surround the Camaro with guns.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEMAN	Show us your hands!
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man inside the car breathes heavily.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEMAN	Pull down the window, and show us your hands now!
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man does so.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEWOMAN	Now slowly open the door with your left hand.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man does so.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEMAN	Get out of the car!
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man again does so.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEMAN	Turn around, slow!
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man turns, and he is revealed to be Hurley.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEMAN 2	On the ground!
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	POLICEWOMAN	Now!
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley stares at the police officers, and tries to run. He is pinned against a wall by the officers.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Stop! Don't you know who I am? Stop, wait, don't you know who I am? I'm one of the Oceanic six! I'm one of the Oceanic six!!!
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley is shown in an interview room with a CCTV video showing him in a convenience store.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	So five minutes before you led ten cruisers on a chase across the city, you're minding your own business in a convenience store, until, you see something and freak out. Mr Reyes, why'd you run like that? Who'd you see in there? Listen buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store and it made you run away in a...
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I wasn't running away from anyone.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	Do you think I care that you're a celebrity? You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighbourhood.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not a celebrity.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	[Chuckles] Is that why you kept shouting "Hey I'm one of the Oceanic Six"? You wanna know a funny coincidence?
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sure.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	I knew somebody on your plane.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Really?
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez. She was my partner before I made detective. Dark hair. Gorgeous. Maybe you knew her? Maybe you met her on the plane? Before it took off?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry, never met her.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	Why don't you watch the tape. Maybe it'll spark something. I'm gonna get a doughnut, you want one?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No thanks.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	When I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The detective leaves the room. Hurley sits passively, and observes the video of him in the store, where he jumps in fear and rushes out of the place in sheer panic. He looks at the mirror in the interview room, which he then sees as an underwater window. A hooded man swims to the window, and touches the glass, which immediately smashes. As water splashes his feet and pours in quickly, Hurley runs for the door.]
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help!
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The detective re-enters the room.]
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	The hell is wrong with you?
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley sees that there is no water in the room, the window being just a mirror again]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DETECTIVE	What are you doing Reyes? Huh, you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? Cause if that's what you want I can make that happen right now, my friend.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You can? [Hurley hugs him] Oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley radios by the DHARMA van for Jack.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack? You there dude? Beach to Jack, come in Jack. Beach to Jack-
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs his walkie and answers.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Right here, Hurley, what's up?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey. Did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat, they're on their way to pick us up right now.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Seriously? It worked?
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack sees Ben watching solemnly.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Seriously, we're all on the way back to the beach right now, so you better pack your bags buddy [he winks at Ben].
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hahaha! Dude that's great! Woohoo!
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley walks towards the others at the beach, while meanwhile Jack finds Kate.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Any luck?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Nothing, no sign of him. (She looks at Naomi lying on the ground) Its like he just disappeared. Why would Locke kill her? He hadn't even met her.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because he's crazy.
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So what if he comes back?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He comes back I'm gonna kill him. [They look at each other for a moment] I'm gonna get everybody together, the sooner we get back to the beach the better.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are we really going home?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. We're really going home.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack leaves, passing Claire and Sun, who are changing Aaron. Rose is also present.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Laughs] I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby in a hospital.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Pushes her arm] Oh rub it in why don't you!
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Laughs] Oh, no...
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	You ladies need a hand?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. You know you must be very proud with Bernard, I hear he's quite the hero.
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	But everyone up here knows that the real hero is your man, Claire. If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be getting a busy signal on that fancy phone. So you'd better make sure you treat him real good when we get back.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Rose!
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all laugh. Meanwhile, Ben is tied to a tree with Rousseau stood next to him. They watch Alex and Karl chatting and laughing.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take Alex and get as far from here as possible.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	What?
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Listen to me, we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get Alex and get away right now, I don't care where you go, just go, I will not have my daughter-
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau hits Ben in the face.]
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	She is not your daughter.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, Juliet is digging graves while Sawyer drinks beer. Hurley and Bernard are looking at the ocean.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? I had like a hundred and fifty million dollars. Worst thing that ever happened to me.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Oh yeah, who needs a hundred and fifty million dollars, right?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Now it'll all be gone. Cause they all think I'm dead. We get rescued and I go back. I'm gonna be free. (Pauses) I wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach everyday and looking out at this water. And I wanna do a cannonball.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Hurley. You wanna do a cannonball? Cannonball.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley does so, running and laughing. He jumps into the water smiling, rises to the surface, and sees the others helping Desmond pull the canoe to the shore. Hurley heads over.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Are you alright Desmond?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We need to get to Jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Easy, Scottie, everything's cool, boat's on the way.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What? On the way? No.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey where's Charlie?
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No that woman, Naomi, she lied. The people on the boat aren't who they say they are!
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	What?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Then who are they?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Desmond, where's Charlie?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I don't know but we need to get in touch with Jack, now!!
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It's alright, we can call him, we have a walkie. It's OK.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Where is it, get it.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	What do you mean the people aren't who they say they are?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Shouts] Where's Charlie?!
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all stop.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Pauses] I'm, I'm sorry brother. I...
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone realises Charlie is dead.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the radio tower, a phone rings.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That's our ride.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack answers the satellite phone.]
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hello.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Hey Jack. This is George Minkowski. We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, but we're getting some RF interference. We're gonna need to re-jigger some of the settings on your sat phone.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Er sure, ok, just tell me what I gotta tell.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	How about you put Naomi on.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Naomi went to get some firewood. Can you hold on for a second, let me see if I...
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate turns, and realises Naomi's body is no longer there. Ben sits a little further away staring at the two of them. Jack hangs up on Minkowski.]
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is she?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Grins, and mutters very softly "I dunno".]
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, the group are stilling reeling from Desmond's news.]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look, we gotta call the Doc.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look I'm sorry he's dead. But I don't even know what the hell "not Penny's boat" means.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Calling Jack accomplishes nothing.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	It would accomplish warning him.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It also means warning the people on the freighter that we're suspicious of them. I've no doubt they're monitoring our communications, if we call Jack...
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You know what? I got the walkie, I'm making the call. Hey!
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley grabs the walkie from Sawyer's hand and throws it into the sea.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We better get going.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Shouts] Going where?!
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the radio tower, Jack hands out torches as Rousseau approaches.]
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	I found blood. The girl's trail. Probably crawled away. Can't be more than 10 minutes ahead of us. We should go, now, and find her.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Motions to Ben] We're taking him with us.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	Why would we do that?
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Because I don't trust him with anybody but me.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack goes to the rest of the group.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright, listen up. I need all of you to head back down to the beach. When these people show up, we wanna make sure that we're real easy for them to find. Ok?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You look worried, Jack.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The only thing I'm worried about is missing our ride home.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone prepares to leave and Kate runs up for Jack.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I found her trail. She's headed West across the Island.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Rousseau already found it, we're going after her right now.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	But, are you sure its hers?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Unless someone else is bleeding.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	But if she didn't want us to find her then she could have created a dummy trail. I think we should follow both just in case.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate, six hours from now we're gonna be sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that there was one final thing that we couldn't agree upon. Naomi is hurt, she ran into the jungle, she's not thinking about leaving fake trails.
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're right.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll track her down, why don't you get everybody back to the beach.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You got it.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate hugs Jack, as Ben watches.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Be careful, OK?
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate leaves, and Jack heads out with Rousseau and Ben.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the beach, the group head inland from the shore, ready to find the radio tower group]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The hell's gotten into you, Hugo? They'll all be back in the morning, if you just wait.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You don't wait with warnings dude, you warn.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group then divide up guns.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Hurley plays Connect 4 at a mental institution with a fellow patient.]
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You almost got me that time. How about, best out of seven?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley takes the meds and swallows them quickly.]
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Oh by the way, you have a visitor.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks round to see a man with a visitor's badge on at another table. Hurley heads over to him.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	VISITOR	Mr Reyes. Hello. My name is Matthew Abaddon. I'm an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. Can we talk for a few minutes?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ok.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	I'm here, Mr Reyes, because we heard about your recent... episode. Your arrest. Your incarceration here. Frankly we feel terrible about it. So, on behalf of Oceanic, I'd like to extend you an invitation for a little upgrade.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What kind of upgrade?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls. Where you'd have your own bathroom. You could see the ocean from there...
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't wanna see the ocean.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	No problem.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Actually, thanks, I'm, I'm fine right here.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	Are you fine Mr. Reyes?
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What do you mean?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	You're in a mental institution.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card.
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Abaddon reaches into his pocket, and presents nothing.]
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	I must have left them at home.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Then we're done, dude.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley prepares to go.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	Are they still alive?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[Pauses] What?
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MATTHEW	You heard me.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Nurse. Nurse! Get out of here! You better get out of here! Help me. Help me, he's after me. No no no. That guy's after me. Help me.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSES	It's OK, it's OK.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man has left the room, the door closing behind him, as Hurley looks for him.]
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - In the jungle at night, Hurley and the group trek inland.]
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alright there, Hugo?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, dude, I'm fine.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You wanna talk about it?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Talk about what?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Charlie. I mean, you two were buddies, I just thought...
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley continues on past Sawyer.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm gonna head up and tell 'em to slow down.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I can keep up.
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Alright "esÃƒÂ©"... Just holler if you need me.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer then goes on ahead. Hurley slowly follows, losing sight of the other survivors.]
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Guys. Guys! Guys! Guys!!! Guys!
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley ends up in front of the cabin and hears whispers.]
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Uh oh.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Meanwhile, Jack is following Naomi's trail with Rousseau and Ben.]
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	The blood trail ends here.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What do you mean?
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	It ends.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You're telling me she stopped bleeding here?
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	No. I'm telling you that she fooled us. Doubled back.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Better call the boat. Tell em she's getting a real big bundle of firewood.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack motions to get the phone, but realises it isn't in his pocket.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where is it?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Ok I probably should have told you that I saw her take the phone but you beat me up, Jack. I owed you one.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you talking about?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Kate took it when she hugged you.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack realizes his mistake.]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	She found the right trail too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Rousseau head off back in the direction they came. Jack tugs on the rope tying Ben's hands together, causing him some pain.]
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Meanwhile, Kate is following the real trail. The satellite phone starts ringing. Kate pauses, and then decides to answer.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hello.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Who's this?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Uh, this is Kate.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	You with Jack?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, no, he's not here.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Where's Naomi?
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We're looking for her.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	What do you mean, you're looking for her?
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate ends the call. Blood drips onto her arm. Kate looks up to see Naomi dive down onto her with a knife. She holds it to Kate's throat.]
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Naomi, listen to me. You're hurt, let me help you.
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Help me? I just spent the last three days trying to get you people rescued. And you throw this knife in my back.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	No, no it was not us.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Who?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	His name is John Locke.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Why?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He said that you weren't who you said you were.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The phone rings.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I swear to God, we would never hurt you, you know us. Please. We need your help, please help us.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Give me the phone.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate does so. Naomi falls down and answers.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	George. It's Naomi.
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Naomi, where have you been? What's going on over there?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi looks at Kate.]
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I had an accident. I'm hurt.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Wha, an accident. What accident? What happened? Naomi? Hello? Hello?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi continues to stare at Kate.]
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I hit a tree branch, when I parachuted in. Took it through my gut.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Why did they tell me you were getting firewood?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me until I could talk to you myself.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	We've lost our signal and we can't come get you. Can you change your tracking frequency?
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Yeah. [She presses buttons on the phone] Try it now.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MINKOWSKI	Clear as a bell. Hang on Naomi, we'll get you back here ASAP, OK?
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	I'm sorry, George. Just tell my sister that I love her.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Naomi collapses. Kate realizes she is dead.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the cabin, Hurley approaches with caution. There is a light on inside.]
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hello?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks through a window into the house, seeing a dog painting on the wall, and Christian Shephard in a rocking chair. Another man comes up close to the window, his eye visible. Hurley runs.]
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Help! Help! Help!!!
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley turns round, and suddenly the house is behind him. The door creaks open. Hurley closes his eyes.]
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley opens his eyes again and the house has vanished. He runs backwards and falls over. He screams as he opens his eyes again. John Locke is standing over him.]
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Hello, Hugo.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Locke sit together.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo. How did you get separated from the group?
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I just, fell behind I guess.
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is that why you were shouting for help?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I got scared.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What Desmond said happened down in that station, "not Penny's boat." Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack should never have called those people.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I couldn't agree more.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	It's gonna be hard, to talk them into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo. Because if we can't talk em out of it, then Charlie died for nothing.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer, Juliet and the others are at the front section of the plane wreckage. Hurley arrives.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where the hell have you been, Hugo?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Sorry, I was just er... I got lost.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke arrives also.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you doing here?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I came here for the same reason you did, to warn Jack about the people on that boat. I already gave it a shot, but, I figured I might have better luck with some support.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You want my support? You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group hear voices. They aim their guns. It is revealed to be the other survivors from the radio tower group.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â§â€žÃ¬Ë†Ëœ Ã¬â€Â¨!
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun runs over and hugs Jin. Claire looks for Charlie. Rose sees Bernard and hugs him.]
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Still in one piece.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Rambo.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She touches a bruise on his forehead.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Ow!
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They laugh and hug. Juliet hugs Alex. Desmond moves to speak to Claire. Hurley overtakes.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'll tell her.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He goes over to her, crying.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He's dead. Charlie's dead.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	No.
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hug and cry together. Everyone else watches.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Hurley is sat outside within the mental institution grounds. He draws an Eskimo and an igloo. A patient approaches Hurley]
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PATIENT	I'd watch out if I were you.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What you talking about, dude?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PATIENT	There's a guy over there, staring at you.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What guy?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The patient points.]
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PATIENT	That guy.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley looks over and looks scared. Charlie is standing by a car.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey man. Don't run. Hurley. Just, just, sit down. I wanna talk to you. Come on. Don't do what you did in the store. OK? There's no need to freak out.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	No need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushy, and suddenly you're standing over there by the Ho Hos. You're dead, what do you expect me to do?
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Can we just sit down?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead and I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie takes off his sunglasses and stares Hugo in the eyes.]
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I am dead. But I'm also here.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ok, prove it.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie slaps Hurley.]
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Alright, ok.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They sit down together.]
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie nods.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	[choked up] Then why didn't you tell me?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Because you would have tried to stop me. And since I was gonna do it anyway I thought I would spare you all the drama. And now you have to do something. But you're hiding from it. That's the real reason you ran when you saw me in the store. You knew I was here to tell you.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm not listening to this. No cause you're not here.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley covers his ears and squints his face.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I am here, you're being a baby.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when I open them you'll be gone.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I am here.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	One!
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Don't do this.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Two!
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	They need you.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Three!
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	They need you, Hugo.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Four!
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know they need you.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Five!
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley opens his eyes, and Charlie is gone.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Hurley is still hugging Claire.]
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What, what happened? I mean, how, how did he...
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He was trying to help us.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone stands silently, as Rousseau and Ben arrive. Locke turns, and Jack punches him in the face without giving any warning. The others watch. Locke tries to grab his gun, but Jack gets it from his hands. He cocks the weapon.]
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Jack.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're not gonna shoot me, Jack. Any more than I was gonna shoot-
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack pulls the trigger, but no bullet fires.]
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's not loaded.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack attacks Locke. Sawyer and Sayid pull him away.]
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come on.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Let go of me! Do you know what he did?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	[Shouts] Yes, I know what he did!
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke gets up.]
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All I did, all I have ever done, has been in the best interest of all of us.
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you insane?
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I know I, I have a lot of explaining to do. But, I never did anything to hurt any of you. I even risked my life to tell you there was a traitor in your midst. [He points to Juliet]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	She helped us, John. All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off of this island. You killed Naomi.
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Well, technically, he didn't kill her, yet.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yes, he did.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The others turn to see Kate arrive.]
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	She just died. She didn't give you up, John. She covered for us, and she fixed this.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate hands the satellite phone to Jack.]
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	They're on their way.
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	She didn't cover for anyone. She wants her people to come here. And trust me, when they do we had better be far away from here. I'm going to the Barracks. The Others abandoned them. Its the only place on the Island with any form of security right now, it'll have to do until I can think of something else. Until then, if you wanna live, you need to come with me.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No one's going anywhere with you, John. Because they're not crazy.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He's not crazy. What about Charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there, it worked. But then something must have happened. He must have heard something before he... [Pauses] I don't know why, but he changed his mind.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback images show Charlie drowning, and showing Desmond the message on his hand.]
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Because the last thing he did was to warn us that the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley goes and stands with Locke.]
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Anyone else. There isn't much time.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire joins them, as do a number of others.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's all yours.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben and Rousseau join Locke, as does Alex and Karl.]
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[To Rose] You said you'd never leave the Island, if you wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind you.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I'm not going anywhere with that man.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer moves to join them.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What are you doing?
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Same thing I've always done, Kate. Surviving.
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[It starts to rain. Everyone looks somber.]
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You know where to find us when you change your mind.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke leads his group away; the camp has been split into two factions.]
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash-forward - Hurley is throwing a basketball into a hoop. Jack enters the gym.]
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Do you ever miss?
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He smiles, as does Hurley.]
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Jack.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, I was on my way back from a consult. Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit. Horse?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're on. So, consult huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack starts playing basketball with Hurley.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley shoots and scores. Jack shoots and misses.]
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	H.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Reporters leaving you alone?
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley shoots and scores.]
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah. Still have to sign some autographs when I go out for coffee.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Thinking about growing a beard.
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He shoots and misses again.]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's H-O. So, what are you really doing here, Jack?
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I was just checking on ya, seeing if everything was OK.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Checking to see if I was nuts, if I was gonna tell.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Are you?
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're up.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Nah, you win. I, uh, I gotta run. It was great seeing you Hurley.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack starts to leave.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I went with Locke. I should have stayed with you.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	It's water under the bridge, man.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley.
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	And it's going to do everything it can-
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Shouts] We're never going back!
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack heads for the door.]
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Never say never, dude.
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Jack and Kate observe the front-section plane wreckage.]
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you thinking of Charlie?
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. How did this happen?
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Noises can be heard.]
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thunder's getting louder.
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's not thunder.
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The sound is a helicopter. It shines its light on Jack and Kate, and they see someone parachute out.]
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Come on.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They find the parachutist, who pulls off his helmet and stares at them.]
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PARACHUTIST	Are you Jack?
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Kate look with apprehension.]
