8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Landscape of a corn field. A car drives up to a motel. A blond gets out and changes Nebraska plates to Ohio plates on her car. A couple of kids and a dad exit a motel room, leaving the door slightly ajar. A maid walks by with a cart and stops to clean the room next door. The blond grabs a towel and shampoo off the cart and enters the room with the open door, putting out the Do Not Disturb sign as she enters. The blond dyes her hair and takes a shower. Reveal of Kate.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate enters the motel office and talks to the desk attendant, Sanjay.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hi. I'm expecting a letter -- hold for guest arrival.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SANJAY	Sure, what's your name?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Joan Hart.
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SANJAY	[handing her a letter] Oh, Joan Hart.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a hot of the license plate: Ohio: the heart of it all!/DPN 924A/Shelby. We see Kate reading a letter and crying. She's holding a stack of 20 dollar bills.]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Kate on the beach holding the airplane. Charlie enters.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Platinum.
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Platinum?
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	As in platinum record -- as in a million units sold. Now, Drive Shaft's albums must have spiked when everybody found out that I died in some catastrophic plane disaster. When I come back, alive, it's going to be insane.
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So you think the raft's going to work?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, of course it will work, look at that thing. It's not a raft. They built a sodding boat. And when they get picked up, the helicopters will come, making us ridiculously and eternally famous. What's the matter, don't you want to be famous?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate turns to look at a ruckus over at the raft.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you think is going on over there?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Sure, you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch. I was just assuming you didn't want to die.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	So, when is the next time we can launch?
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	3, maybe 4, months.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	C'mon, even a weather man on TV don't know what's going to happen. Why are we listening to Arzt?
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Because I'm a doctor, and you're a hillbilly.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're a damn high school science teacher.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, Sawyer, just let the man talk.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	It's been raining every afternoon. That means that we are on the cusp on monsoon season. Monsoon season is bad. Now, the trade winds are blowing north right now -- shipping lanes are north -- so north is exactly where you want to be.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What does that mean?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	It means that when monsoon season hits the trade winds are going to shift to the south. The raft goes with the wind. Can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that is south of us?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Antarctica.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	That's right, Jack, Antarctica.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	So, when do we have to leave?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ARZT	Yesterday.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate catching up to Michael walking along the beach.]
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So obviously you believe him?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Arzt? I don't know, but I'm not taking any chances.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You think you'll be ready by tomorrow?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	The man said not a day to waste.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Supplies all set? You've got food, fresh water?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Kate, no offense, but I've got work to do. Why the sudden interest?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because I'm going with you.
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Look, the raft's full -- we need 4, we got 4.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Including Sawyer?
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Including him. We needed the stuff he had so he bought his way on.
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	To the first raft, which burned.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You know, I'm not going to get into semantics with you. I told the guy...
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He doesn't even know how to sail.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	And you do?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I spent 2 summers crewing J boats. I know my way around a sailboat.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, maybe so, but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You're bringing Walt, too? I'm just saying it's dangerous.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I decide what's best for my boy. And right now, what's best for him is to get the hell off this Island. The raft's full.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Kate with a large bouquet of flowers walking down a hospital corridor. She walks up to a nurses station.]
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT	[in background] Hospital chaplain to the neural ICU. Hospital chaplain please report to the neural ICU.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	Right, she just came up from ICU. She's in room 208. It's around the corner to your right.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thanks.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NURSE	You're welcome.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate sees an officer guarding a room and uses the flowers to hide her face as she passes.]
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a doctor getting into his car.]
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[from the back of the car] Hey, Tom.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Oh, Katie. What are you doing here?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Diane's dying of cancer. I thought I owed it to her to come see her.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	I heard. I'm sorry.
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, me too.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	So any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I need your help.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the beach, Sun approaches Jin as he's working on the raft.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«â€¹Â¹Ã¬â€¹Â Ã«Ââ€ž ÃªÂ°Ë† ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬Å¡â€? Ã¬â€”Â¬Ã«Â³Â´, Ã¬Â Å“Ã«Â°Å“ Ã«â€šËœÃ«Å¾â€˜ Ã¬â€“ËœÃªÂ¸Â° Ã¬Â¢â‚¬ Ã­â€¢Â´Ã¬Å¡â€. [Subtitle: Are you going? Please Jin, talk to me.]
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«â€šËœÃ«Ââ€ž ÃªÂ°Ë† ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€¢Â¼. [Subtitle: Yes, I'm going.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun walks away.]
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack and Sayid walking in the jungle.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How much further?
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We're almost there.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You want to tell me where we're going, Sayid?
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	It's better that you see it for yourself.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, I'm not so sure that it is. Tell me why you brought me out here or I'm going to turn around.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[appearing] He brought you out here because I asked him to. I asked him not to tell you. I wanted you to have an open mind.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Open mind about what?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke motions for Jack to follow him. They walk to the Hatch.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	My god, what is this thing?
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Exactly. I guess it's time we talked about this.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael dragging a metal-looking thing to the raft. Sawyer's drinking water.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yo, chief, dumb question here -- we're sailing out in the ocean, right?
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Do you mind?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We can't catch fish?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Do you know anything about surviving at sea -- sailing, navigating, steering a raft?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Do you?
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It doesn't matter what I know, I built it. Maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You're going to vote me off, Mickey? And who the hell's going to take my place?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate burning the photo of a passport. Sawyer enters.]
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell do you think you're doing?
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm sorry?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Don't give me the awe-golly eyes. Michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I was just asking some questions. He must have misunderstood me.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[grabbing Kate's arm] I know what you're doing.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, just like I know why you wanted that Halliburton case so bad -- the one that belonged to that U.S. Marshal who was flying with us. You were his prisoner.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Let go of me.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	The only chance of running is getting on that raft, ain't it? We get picked up by a ship and they come back to rescue the rest of you all -- there's going to be a nice big asterisk next to your name. Don't worry puddin', your secret's safe with me. But just so you know -- no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey Sawyer. I want your spot, I'll get your spot.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael and Jin working on the raft. Walt enters.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, give me that water, man.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	[tossing a water bottle to Michael] Yo, dad.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Thanks.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	So what were you and Sawyer arguing about?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I told him something he didn't want to hear.
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Why does he want to get on the raft so much?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Because he knows it's going to work.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	When we get rescued we're going to come back for everybody else, right?
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, sure, of course. The thing is -- this Island, uh, is, uh -- finding it again might be hard.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Can't we fly around and look for it?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Absolutely, but there's no guarantees. That's why you and me-
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael is suddenly unsteady and sick.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad?
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Oh [he chuckles to play it off]. That's why you and... [Michael doubles over in pain]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad! Dad!
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Get Jack.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt leaves.]
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Walt running through the jungle. He comes upon Kate and Sun.]
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Help! I need help. It's my dad.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What's the matter?
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	His stomach is really bad.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[to Sun] Take him back to Michael. I'll go get Jack.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Okay. Let's go.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	This way.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate running through the jungle.]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack! Jack!
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack, Locke and Sayid at the Hatch.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How long have you known about this?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	3 weeks, give or take.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	3 weeks. You've been out here for 3 weeks digging this thing up and you never told me about it?
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All due respect, Jack, but since when do I report to you?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	All due respect, John, but you lied.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know? You used your best discretion. I used mine.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So how do we open it?
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What? You want to open it?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We should bury it! I brought you here to talk him out of this insanity. Anything could be inside!
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Best case scenario there's supplies -- worst case, we use it as a shelter.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Actually, Jack, I can think of much worse cases than that. You notice anything about this hatch? There's no handle. Could the reason for that be more obvious?! Maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Locke, Jack and Sayid walking back to camp. They hear Kate calling out to Jack.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack! Jack!
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah, over here!
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's Michael, something's wrong.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Michael in pain at the beach. Jack is examining him.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What'd you eat today?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Uh, fruit, fish.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You drinking enough water?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	2 or 3 bottles.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where are you getting that water from?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You know, the caves, like everybody else.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Alright, listen, Michael, just take it easy, okay? You stay in the shade and try not to move too much, okay.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No. We have to launch that raft tomorrow. We have to.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I know, I know. I need you to lay back.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Locke walk off. Kate helps Michael.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Lay down. Just lay down, okay.
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Kate at Tom's place, looking at pictures of his wife and kid on the refrigerator.]
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	[on the phone] Hello? Hey, Adam, hey, listen can you carve out some time for me on the MRI? Yeah, it's a favor for a friend of a friend. Um, no, that would work out great, okay. Yeah, thanks, Adam. [He hangs up the phone and sees Kate looking at the pictures.] His name's Conner.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How old is he?
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	22 months next week.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's beautiful.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Yeah, well, it's Rachel, it's not me.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where is she?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	She's over in Cedar Rapids visiting her folks. They get back on Sunday. I got Diane in for an MRI. Now, they'll bring her downstairs to radiology. The appointment's not til 5am, so, we've got about 3 hours to kill.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Tom...
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	You're welcome.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You think it's still there?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What?
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You know what.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	It's the middle of the night, Katie.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We might not get another chance.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate and Tom drive up under a big tree and get shovels out. Kate counts off 6 paces and they start digging.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Locke and Jack walking on the beach.]
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What do you think it is? Heatstroke?
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, he would have felt that coming on.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Bad fruit maybe? Raw fish?
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Michael and Jin are on the same diet.
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, Jin's fine.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[looking at a cooler of water bottles by the raft] Jin's fine. What was making him sick was metabolized fast. It hit him quick and it hit him hard.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	So you think it was the water.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[showing Locke the bottom of a water bottle with some white deposits] No, I don't think it was the water. I think it was something in the water.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jin and others working on the raft. Jack is with Michael.]
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Feeling any better?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	The cramps are quieting down -- as long as I don't move, or, -- or breathe.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets some water for Michael and notices Hurley talking to Locke.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You and Locke kiss and make up? [Jack shakes his head.] Good.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael reaches for his water bottle. Jack stops him and gives him a different one.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, Michael.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Drink from that one.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Somebody did this to me?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know. I'm not sure of anything yet.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Sawyer.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley talking with Locke.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I'm on bamboo duty, but yeah, sometimes I help refill the water.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Michael and Jin getting along?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, they fight like a married couple building a raft together...
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[to Jack who has just entered] You told him?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Think Sawyer might have done it.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Oh, because of Kate?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft. So Sawyer went off on Michael because, you know, he gets to decide who goes. Hey, you don't think Kate did it, do you?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Why would Kate poison Michael?
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack has a look like "Hurley you idiot."]
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	He doesn't know? [Jack shakes his head.] Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here? I mean, Steve didn't even know about the polar bear.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What did she do?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know. Why don't you ask her?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	And you didn't think the others should know about this, Jack?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Discretion, John.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the baby in the crib. Charlie is playing guitar while Claire tries to cut his hair.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Okay, can you stop moving or I'm going to cut your ear off.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah, this is good. I'm writing again. I'm really feeling it, as well. So, what's the first thing you're going to do when we get rescued?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You know, I don't really know.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You can hang out with me in L.A. -- you and turnip-head. You know, until you figure things out.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thanks.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Smashing. Okay, check this out. This is track 2. It's called... [he turns his head and she straightens it so she can keep cutting.] Sorry. It's called "Monster Eats the Pilot".
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jack at the caves looking through medical supplies. Kate enters.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	How's Michael?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's going to be fine.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Somebody going to be taking his place on the raft?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Because, you know, Dr. Arzt said if they leave tomorrow...
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Did you poison Michael, Kate?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He's not sick, someone did this.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Do you really think I'm capable of that?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't know what you're capable of.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate leaves, upset.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see Kate digging and Tom getting a beer from the car.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You brought beer?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	No self-respecting man in Iowa goes anywhere without beer.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate laughs, takes a sip from her beer can.]
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	It's not fair, you know -- you coming back. Here. Home.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, I know.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate strikes something metal and pulls a box out of the ground (A New Kids on the Block lunch box). They open the box to reveal a red ball cap, the plane, a tape, and few other items.]
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Wow.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Wow. Oh.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Oh my god. My plane. [laughs] I can't believe I let you talk me into putting this in there.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	That was your idea. [She picks up the tape.] Kate and Tom, 1989.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They listen to the tape in the car.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG TOM	Is it on? I don't think it's on.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG KATE	It's on.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG TOM	Okay, this is Kate Austen and Tom Brennan and this is our dedication for our time capsule, here on August 15th, 1989. Hey, give me that back.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG KATE	Why are you putting this stupid plane in there?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG TOM	Because it's cool, Katie. I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG KATE	Ooh, that is cool, just like this time capsule.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG TOM	It'll be totally cool when we dig it up in like 20 years.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG KATE	How do you know we'll be together?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG TOM	Because we'll be married and you'll be a mom and we'll have 9 kids.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG KATE	I don't think so. As soon as I get my license we should just get in a car and drive. You know, run away.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG TOM	You always want to run away, Katie.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG KATE	Yeah, and you know why.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The tape ends.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	Funny how things turn out, huh?
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss.]
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sorry.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	We'd better get to the hospital.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Locke doctoring his leg wound. Walt enters.]
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	What happened?
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I had a little accident.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Does it hurt?
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yep. Something you want to tell me, Walt?
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I didn't do it.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Didn't do what?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I heard Jack. He thinks somebody got my dad sick. And I didn't do it.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You think because I know you burned the first raft that I'd think you made your dad sick? [Walt nods.] We're friends, Walt. I didn't tell on you before and I'm not going to tell on you now. [He puts his hand on Walt's wrist.] And I know you would never do anything to hurt your dad.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt looks down at Locke's hand and pulls his arm away.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What's the matter?
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Don't open it.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What'd you say?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Don't open it, Mr. Locke. Don't open that thing.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What? What thing?
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Just don't open it.
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer throws a bottle of Pepto Bismol-type stuff down by Michael.]
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thought you might need that, boss. Wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before take-off.
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What? You feeling guilty?
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You're off the raft.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Come again?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You're off the raft!
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	We had a deal.
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, well, the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I did what now?
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm done with you.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You ain't done with me by a damn sight. You said you needed 4!
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I've got 4! You've been stealing stuff off of dead bodies, keeping it for yourself, using it to buy favors. You're a liar and a criminal, and I'm not letting you near my boy!
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, I'm a criminal, huh?! I poisoned you because I'm a criminal!
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin jumps up and pushes Sawyer back.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[to Jin] Get your hands off me, boy. [to Kate] Hey, sweet-cheeks! I had no idea how bad you wanted off this rock. Time to set things straight.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He grabs Kate and pulls her over to Michael.]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Let go of me.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Tell him who the criminal is!
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey, leave her alone, man!
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Tell him!
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs her backpack.]
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Give that back.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Leave her alone!
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Leave her alone?
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Give that back.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer dumps her stuff out and grabs the passport.]
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Mmm-hmmm. Look. Look at this.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sawyer, please.
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You all remember Joanna, don't you? Huh? The woman who drowned? [He hands the passport to Michael.] Now what's Kate doing with poor Joanna's ID? Could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft? So she could get herself rescued, run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn Island? She might even poison the captain himself.
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Shut up!
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	She don't care about nothin' or nobody but herself.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - In the hospital, we see Tom and a hospital worker wheeling Diane out of a room.]
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	[to hospital worker] This is good here. Thank you.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tom makes sure the coast is clear and then motions to Kate to come out from behind a wall.]
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	My office is right back there. I'll wait for you.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate approaches Diane who's eyes are closed.]
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hi, mom. Can you hear me? Mom?
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Diane opens her eyes.]
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Mom? [Kate cries.] It's me, Katie.
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	Katherine?
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's me, Katherine. I'm so sorry for everything that I have put you through.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	[softly] Help. Help.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's okay, mom. It's just me.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	[more loudly] Help. Help.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	It's okay.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DIANE	Help. Help me. Help me! Somebody help me! Help me, somebody.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The hospital worker sees Kate and she runs out. She runs into a security guard.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SECURITY GUARD	What's going on?
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm her daughter. She's just confused. I was going to get a doctor.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SECURITY GUARD	[grabbing Kate's arm] Hang on. [Into his walkie-talkie] We've got a situation-
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate grabs his walkie-talkie and clocks him with it. Tom enters.]
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	What happened?
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I need your car keys. [She runs.]
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	[running after her] Kate, Katie?
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They get in the car with Kate driving. A police car blocks the exit to the garage.]
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Get out.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	I am not letting you do this. Katie, if you cooperate they go easy...
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's calling for backup! I've got to go! Get out!
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	You can have a real life.
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Tom, please.
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	No.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Now. Get out.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOM	No!
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate drives through the blockade while the officer shoots. She crashes and then sees that Tom is shot, apparently dead.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Tom? Tom! Oh god, Tom. No, no, no, Tom. Please wake up.
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She sees a cop car approach, and notices the contents of the time capsule in the back seat. She flees on foot.]
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island]
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You want to tell us why you need to run so bad? You want to tell us the truth?
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yes. I was on the plane -- with the Marshal. Yes, I was wanted and caught and being transported back. No matter what I say about what happened -- about what I supposedly did -- I'm going to jail. [to Michael] But I didn't poison you.
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[handing the passport to Sawyer] Here.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Everyone is stunned. They leave Kate standing alone on the beach.]
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Jin and others working on the raft while Sun looks on. Jack enters.]
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	He looks determined.
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Yes, he is.
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You don't want him to go, do you?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	No.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is that why you tried to make him sick? Michael and Jin working together all the time -- pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up...
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I didn't want him to die out there. I just didn't know what to do. I only used enough to make him -- I wasn't trying to hurt him. Are you going to tell the others?
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I don't see any reason why they need to know. But Sun, he's going. If I were you, I'd -- I'd say goodbye.
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate alone at a fire. Sawyer enters.]
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I'm back on the raft.
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I'm glad to hear it.
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Michael's going to cowboy up. We set sail tomorrow.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Nah, sorry don't suit me. You cornered me, Freckles. I did what I had to.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	I cornered you?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You said if you wanted my spot you were going to take it. I guess I believed you. Well, that's that. I've got some packing to do.
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	'Cuz there ain't anything on this Island worth staying for.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They share a long glance and Kate takes a moment to respond.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Be safe, Sawyer.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah.
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Walt and Michael at the beach by the raft.]
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, buddy.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Feeling better?
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, yep. I'm going to be alright. Hey, don't worry. I'm going to be on my feet soon. We'll be sailing home before you can even-
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	I'm the one that burned the raft. I didn't want to leave and I thought I could stop you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, dad.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, it's okay, man. We can stay here. You and me. We don't have to go.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Yes we do.
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Kate and Sun at a beach shelter.]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Hello.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Jack knows. I didn't tell him it was your idea.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Thanks.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Why should you be punished? You were only trying to help me. He said he wouldn't tell the others.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, Jack's good at keeping secrets.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	When I was a little girl I believed that once I found the man I loved I would be happy, forever.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Yeah, me too.
