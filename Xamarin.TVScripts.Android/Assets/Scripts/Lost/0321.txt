4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Stephen Williams
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Karl runs through the jungle. He reaches the shore, and grabs a canoe, setting off with a paddle around the Island.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inland, Jack leads a group of survivors: Desmond, Charlie, Kate, Sawyer, Claire, Sayid, Juliet, Sun, Jin and Hurley.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Anyone want to venture a guess as to what Jack's going to be showing us out here in the middle of nowhere?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	I dunno. Stuff. Probably secret stuff.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Why does everything have to be such a secret? How about some openness for a change?
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond pauses.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	We kept the parachute lady secret.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah, that's different.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Different how?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, because we weren't out there playing football with them-
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie notices Desmond has paused.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Nothing.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Wait. You had one of your flashes again, didn't you?
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	No, Charlie. I didn't.
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We're here.
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The two catch up with the rest of the group. They all gather around Jack and Juliet.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	A couple of nights ago, Juliet came to me and she told me everything: that Ben had sent her here to find out which of our women were pregnant...
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So, what, you guys were doing tests on us?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No, but that's what he wanted me to do. I've been leaving tapes at the medical station. You all heard what he said; they're coming tomorrow. Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	While I appreciate your honesty, Jack, it doesn't explain why you brought us out here.
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	DANIELLE!
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau suddenly emerges from the trees.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Show 'em.
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rousseau grabs two wires, links them, causing an explosion which brings down a tree. The whole group are startled.]
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	When Juliet told me they were coming, the first thing I thought was, "Where the hell are we gonna hide this time?" But hiding's pointless. They're just gonna keep coming back. So I went out and I found some help. And for the past few days she's been bringing dynamite back from the Black Rock. For the very first time we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it, and they have no idea that we're gonna be waiting for 'em. So Juliet's gonna mark the tents with the white rocks just like she was told to, but there's not going to be any pregnant women inside; there's gonna be plenty of what we just used on that tree. So tomorrow night, we stop hiding, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them, because when they show up, we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Two men in a van play with the radio, while outside Charlie and Liam are trying to fix a flat tire.]
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, bloody hell!! Why are we even doing this?!
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Chin up, mate. We're headlining.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Headlining? We're playing Clitheroe - the arse-end of nowhere.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	A gig's a gig. We're building our fan base.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Will our fan base pay for a new sodding tire?
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Only if we show up. So let's just get on with it, shall we?
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know what, Liam? You get on with it. I quit.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	You giving up?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	There's nothing to give up on! We're broke. The album's not selling. We're a bloody joke-
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DRIVER	Hey, shut it! Listen!
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The band's song "You All Everybody" plays on the radio.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	That's us. We're on the radio.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	That we are.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're on the bloody radio!
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They all laugh and cheer]
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	I told you, baby brother, we're gonna be bloody rock stars!
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Charlie writes a list on a piece of paper with a black marker pen. He writes "#5 The first time I heard myself on the radio".]
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Can I ask you something?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie turns to her.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Who are you people about to go to war with?
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Now that's a long story. Wanna ask me something else?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	You having a laugh?
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, of course not. I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	You're from Manchester then?!
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I am. My band got its start at the Night and Day bar on Oldham Street.
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	[Laughs] What band?
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, we're called Drive Shaft.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Yeah, yeah, I know you.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We had our moment in the sun-
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	No, not that, the crash. You're the dead rock star. They made a big deal out of you when they found the plane - huge memorial service, new album.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	There's a new album?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Yeah. God, it was everywhere... a greatest hits thing.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie smiles but then sees Desmond in the distance.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NAOMI	Hey, look on the bright side. You're not really dead, right?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, right.
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They smile as Desmond walks on.]
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[By the tents, Jack and Juliet carefully unwrap and place the dynamite.]
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	We need more wire so we can trigger these from a safe distance.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I can get some people to start stripping the plane wreckage.
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	Good. I should be able to finish rigging these tents in the next 24 hours. We'll be ready by tomorrow night.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack and Juliet leave the tent as Sayid catches up to them.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We need to talk about Naomi's phone.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Not now.
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	If you're angry, I doubted you I'll be happy to make a sincere apology later, but now we have a means of-
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid-
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And I am trying to get us off this Island, Jack!
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack concedes and listens, as do Juliet and Rousseau.]
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency. [To Danielle] If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can go there, switch off your message, and call for help.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	That signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it. What makes you think that you'll have better luck?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	But Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore. I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they will hear us-
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	No, they won't.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And why is that?
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	We're jamming it.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Ben is using one of the DHARMA stations to block all of the signals off of the Island except for ours.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What station?
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They call it The Looking Glass.
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	The Looking Glass.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Yes, but it's underwater. I have no idea where it is.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I believe I do.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At Claire's tent, Charlie plays with Aaron.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Look, I know Jack thinks it's best, but, you know, what if they're coming for him again?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire, listen to me. I'm going to protect you. I'm going to protect Aaron. I promise. Everything is going to be fine.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire nods as Desmond arrives.]
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Er, sorry. Er, Charlie. Can you give me a hand with something?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, Desmond. Course.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They start walking together.]
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, you ready to tell me what you saw this morning?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right. So how's it happen this time?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Come on, Des. You can tell me. I can take it.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Pause.]
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What I saw, Charlie, was Claire and her baby getting into a helicopter. A helicopter that lifts off - leaves this Island.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Are you sure?
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	A rescue helicopter on this beach?
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond nods.]
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This Island - that's what you saw?
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond nods again.]
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're getting bloody rescued! I thought you were gonna tell me I was gonna die again!
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You are, Charlie.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Wait, what?
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	If you don't, none of it will happen. There won't be any rescue. I'm sorry, brother, but this time - this time you have to die.
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - At a swimming pool, young Charlie stands by the pool while his father and brother are in the water.]
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PACE	Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on, Charlie! Jump in. I'm gonna catch you boy!
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No. You're just going to back away.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PACE	Don't be daft. Jump in.
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PACE	I promise, Charlie, I'm gonna catch ya.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	No he won't.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PACE	Zip it you! Don't listen to your brother. Just jump on in. There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie. I'll catch ya, I promise.
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie steps forward to the edge of the pool, as children nearby shout. One distinctly says, "Desmond, come on!" Charlie jumps in, and isn't caught. He dives under the water, floats back up.]
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I did it!
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PACE	You've got it.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Seen it!
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MR. PACE	You're swimming, Charlie, you're swimming!
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Charlie writes on his paper: "#4 Dad teaching me to swim at Butlins".]
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What are you writing?
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Pauses] Nothing. All right, tell me.
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You sure you wanna know? I mean it might be easier if you jus-
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. I want to know.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You're inside a hatch. It's, er... a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light above a switch. You flick the switch... light goes off... and then you drown.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Nods, then pauses] When?
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I don't know.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You sure you saw Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter?
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Aye.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, before I drown, I just have to flip a switch.
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	That's right.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Where is it, then?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Further down the beach, Sayid, Jack and Juliet examine files obtained from the Flame station.]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Now this is The Looking Glass. Its an underwater DHARMA station. Please, can you tell me anything you might know about this place?
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	I've never been down there. I don't know anyone who has.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why not?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	There was some accident. Ben told us that the station was completely flooded.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, if it's flooded then how does it still work?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	How it still works is irrelevant. The question is, how do we get it to stop working, so we can use the satellite phone. The diagram shows that The Looking Glass is connected to the Island by a cable. I feel sure that this is the very same cable down the beach which runs into the ocean. So if we follow the cable, it should lead us to the station.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	So how are we gonna get in?
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We swim in. There's a moon pool. A room with an open floor at the base if the station, big enough for a submarine to dock. Even if the station's flooded, I think I'll be able to find the relay switch and disable it.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What about swimming back out?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid looks at him.]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. No, I'm not letting you go on some suicide mission just to flip a switch.
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	But someone has to do it or we'll never leave this Island.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Desmond arrive.]
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'll do it. Swim down, turn off that bloody switch, swim back up. Piece of cake.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Charlie, you don't even know what we're talking about.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I was junior swim champion in Northern England. I can hold my breath for four minutes. I know exactly what you're talking about, Jack.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[All pause.]
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No. And there's no reason to do this now. We're going to focus on the Others, and then we'll deal with this.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Wait a minute. We have the chance to signal for a rescue.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Look, for 90 days I've been asked to make decisions for this entire camp. There you go. I just made one.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Along the beach, the survivors gather plane wreckage to get more wire for the dynamite plan.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Rose, that's a sailor's hitch. It's not gonna hold. You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Oh, so now you're knot expert.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	[Laughs] Well trust me its, uh...
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Rose pulls his knot apart easily, then makes her own perfect sheet bend knot very quickly and pulls it taut to demonstrate its strength.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	How did you do that?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Watch and learn, dear. Watch and learn.

352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Hey!!! Look, there!!! Look!!
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The group look to see Karl arriving at the shore by canoe. He runs towards them, and they to him. Sayid tackles him down.]
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Get off him, dammit, it's OK.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What?! He's one of them!
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I know, I know, it's OK. He was in the cage next to me. I know this guy. What the hell are you doing here, Karl?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	They're coming. My people.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Sorry you came all this way for nothing, but we already know.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	Then why are you still here?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Because when your people show up here tomorrow night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	Tomorrow? No. No, they're coming tonight. They're coming right now!!!
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Six hours ago. Alex is skinning a rabbit in the Others camp as Ben arrives back]
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Hey! When'd you get back?
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Just now.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Where's Locke?
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben pulls out a gun.]
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Coldly] Here's your gun back.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Ben, what's going on?
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Where's Ryan?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	He's at his tent, are you...
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	It's time to get them.
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	[Mumbles] But you said tomorrow.
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Jacob wants it to happen now.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	Look, what happened out there--did John see...
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	John had an accident. Ryan!
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Yes sir.
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	If you leave right now, how long will it take you to reach their camp?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	Well, if I take my ten best, we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Then you'd better get going.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RICHARD	No, no, Ben, wait, moving at this schedule, Juliet may not be ready. What if she hasn't had time to...
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Then we'll take all their women. And we'll sort out the ones we need later.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	And the men?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	RYAN	All right.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[After overhearing the conversation, Alex runs into the jungle.]
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Karl. It's me.
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	I thought you were bringing rabbit.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	You have to go. Now.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	What? Did he find out I was out here?
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	No. But he's sending Pryce to their beach camp right now, you have to warn them.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	Warn them?
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	You have to go, now!
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	I thought they were going to just take the pregnant women.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	If you take the outrigger, you'll get there a few hours before them.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	Whoa, wait, Alex...
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	He's gonna kill them, Karl! Austen and Ford saved your life. You owe them. You better take this.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She hands him a gun.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	If I get caught, your father's gonna kill me this time.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Is he my father?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss.]
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ALEX	Now go.
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Karl runs through the jungle to the shore and sets off in the canoe.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - The entire group have surrounded Karl, with Jack pacing around him]
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is that everything?
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	Yeah.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To Kate] You trust him?
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate shrugs.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	You don't trust me? What about her!
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He points at Juliet.]
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	She's a spy. She's supposed to mark the tents of the pregnant women with white rocks so they can take them.
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	They know, Karl, but thanks.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	So what are we going to do?
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	We have to leave now. Hide.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Where? It's their Island; if they wanna kill us; they'll find us.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	The sun's gonna go down in a few hours. [To Rousseau] Do we have enough wire yet?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	Not even close.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We've gotta figure out a different way of setting the dynamite off.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	We could shoot.
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We don't have enough guns. He said that ten of them are coming, armed.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Not the Others, the tents. We can camouflage the dynamite next to the tents. Target it from our positions at the tree line.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Juliet marked three tents, that means we need three guns.
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Karl pulls out a gun.]
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Whoa!
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KARL	Here. You can have mine too.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROUSSEAU	I'll be your third.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	We'll take your gun, but you're not staying here. You're gonna lead everyone to the radio tower. Everyone.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Radio tower?!
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Now if this doesn't work, we can't risk losing the chance of getting in contact with Naomi's boat, so everything has to happen at the same time. Charlie? You still up for a swim?
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, I believe I am.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'll go with him.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	OK. We better get to it.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Charlie lies in a hotel room with two women. Liam enters and jumps on the bed.]
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Ho ho ho. It's here, baby brother. Christmas is here. Oi, are these the birds from row two? Well done, mate. Well, as you have spent another year as the only drug-free rock star in the world, I'm gonna share a little known fact with you. Father Christmas lives just down the street from here.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Father Christmas lives in Helsinki?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Indeed he does. And in case you haven't noticed, baby brother, Finland is the bloody North Pole. Therefore, a very special gift for you this year.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Liam pulls off his "DS" ring.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Liam, no. Mum gave you that. You're the first born. It was her father's and his father before that...
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	And it's a family heirloom, and that's why we named the band after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know. But Charlie--let's be honest--we both know I'm a sodding mess. But you, you're different. You're gonna get married, have a family, a baby. I'll be lucky if I hit thirty.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Don't say that, Li.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	The ring has to stay in the family, Charlie. So please, take it. Mum would have wanted it this way. Pass it on to your little one someday. I need to know it's safe.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'll hold onto it. But I won't take it. Hey, fits. Look at that.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIAM	Happy Christmas, baby brother.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Charlie is once more writing his list - "#3 The Christmas Liam gave me the ring". He sits smiling and stroking the ring before going to see Claire at her tent.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You need some help?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Why didn't you tell me you were going to do this?
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I didn't want you to worry.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Well, it's dangerous, isn't it? Swimming into some underwater station.
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's what needs to be done to get us all rescued. I'll be fine, Claire. Now you've gotta promise me something. While I'm gone, don't worry about me.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	'K.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'll take him.
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thanks.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie takes Aaron and puts him in his crib.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hey! All right turnip head, now you take care of your Mum while I'm away, OK? [Pauses] I love you.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He goes to Claire again.]
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	See you soon.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Be careful Charlie, K?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They kiss, and then Charlie leaves.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Charlie stands singing Wonderwall outside Covent Garden underground station, but is interrupted by torrential rain.]
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Sorry, guys. Thanks, man.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He puts his guitar away and sets off.]
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Hey, help me! Help! Help! Help!
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie looks to see down an alley a woman being mugged. He hesitates but then intervenes.]
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	OI!!!
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WOMAN	Help!
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oi! Get the hell away from her.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie hits the man mugging her with his guitar case.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What are you doing? Leave her alone!
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The man runs away.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You OK, Miss?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The woman is Nadia.]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Yes, I think so, yes.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Hands her her purse] Here you go. [Pants] Pardon me while I have a heart attack. The last time I was in a fight I was eight years old. [Laughs] And I lost.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Well, that makes you even more of a hero, doesn't it?
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I just did what anyone would do.
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	Three people walked by the alley.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NADIA	They saw me, but they just kept on going. You are a hero, sir. And don't let anyone ever tell you differently.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Charlie adds to his list - "#2 Woman outside Covent Garden calls me a hero." He and Desmond are by the canoe ready to go. Charlie sees Desmond making something.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What's that?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	It's a weight belt. Should bring you down quicker than swimming. Well, every second counts.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So I just take it off when I hit bottom, swim up through the moon pool, into the station, swim into whichever room has the yellow blinking switch, flip it. Nothing to it.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So how long can you really hold your breath for?
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Does it matter?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Further away, Bernard shoots DHARMA cans off a branch at a range. Sayid and Rose observe.]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	You want me to hit another one?
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	No, you've made your point.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting in Montgomery County.
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	I know what I'm doing.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	No, you don't. Pheasants don't shoot back.
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BERNARD	Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose. I just have to shoot a tent. And I'll be right behind ya.
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Then I'm staying, too.
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, you're not, Rose.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They turn to see Jack's arrival.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Everyone's gathering down at the south end of the beach. No one's staying behind but the shooters.
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	Says who? You wanna give me your word that nothing's going to happen to my husband, then I go.
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'll give you my word that if we don't kill everyone that shows up here in about an hour, it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROSE	I like you better since you got back, Jack. You're almost an optimist. [To Bernard] Come on. If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes, let's get ya into something dark.
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You better get going. Rousseau says it's about a day's walk up to the radio tower.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I'm not taking them to the tower. You are.
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Excuse me?
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	You're not staying behind.
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	This was my idea.
656	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	And I'm perfectly capable of executing it.
658	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I owe them!
660	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	What are you more concerned about, killing the Others, or getting our people off this Island? This afternoon you said you were our leader. It's time for you to act like one. Lead them to the radio tower, Jack. And then take us all home.
662	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[By the shore, as Charlie and Desmond sit, Hurley arrives.]
664	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dudes, wait! I heard. I heard what you're doing. I wanna come with. Everyone - they're all going to the radio tower ... and I'm sick of trekking and, you know, explosions. I think I can help you guys out. I'm a really good paddler.
666	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You can't go, Hurley.
668	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Why not?
670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Because... you're too big! You won't fit in the boat.
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	That's uncool, man.
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley begins to go.]
676	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Wait, wait, wait!
678	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie hugs him.]
680	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Dude, it's fine. I don't even wanna go on your stupid boat.
682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Catch up with you later. Just remember I love you, man.
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yeah, whatever, love you too.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley goes and Charlie watches after him.]
688	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The rest of the camp are all ready to leave.]
690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[To random survivors] You got water in there? Good, good. How about you, lot of water? Good.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Hey.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	So here we go again, huh?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	[Laughs] Here we go again.
700	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	The tents are all marked. We're set.
702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sayid find the third shooter?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Juliet motions over her shoulder to Jin, who is helping Sun pack her bag.]
706	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire is at her tent packing her bag. Hurley arrives.]
708	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Ready, Claire? Need a hand with the little guy?
710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Er, no, thanks. I'm OK. [To Aaron] How's my little sweetheart? We're just going to go for a little walk, so hold onto Mum, OK?
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As they leave with Vincent, Charlie's "DS" ring can be seen in Aaron's crib.]
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie pushes the boat out, while Desmond finds the cable.]
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	This is it. Ready?
718	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They push off, using the cable as a guide along the water.]
720	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Charlie is on the Island, amongst the plane wreckage, presumably on their first night after the crash. He sees a pregnant Claire sat down and heads over.]
722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Hiya. Do you want a blanket?
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Oh, thanks. I got one.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, you're warming for two, take mine.
728	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thank you.
730	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, first plane crash?
732	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[Sarcastically] What gave it away?
734	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Ah you can always spot the newbies. We're gonna be OK, you know.
736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Are we?
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	We're alive, we're on a beautiful Island. We'll sleep under the stars, and before you know it the helicopters will come and take us all home.
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You really think they'll find us?
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?
744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thanks.
746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm Charlie.
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I'm Claire. Nice to meet you, Charlie.
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's nice to meet you.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Present - Charlie finishes his list - "#1 The night I met you." Desmond finds where the cable sinks into the depths straight down.]
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	We're here.
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Holds out the list] I want you to give this to Claire for me.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[Takes it] What is it?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It's the five best moments of my... sorry excuse for a life. My greatest hits. You know, memories. They're all I've got.
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	You don't have to do this Charlie.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I'll go.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, you-your flashes.
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Maybe I keep seeing you die because I'm supposed to take your place.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What about your girl, Penny?
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What about your girl? Besides, I might be luckier than you. Keep your memories to yourself. I'll take it from here.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He takes off his shoes ready to go instead.]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't know what to say.
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Well, you could tell me where the, er, weigh belt is.
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Right there behind you.
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As Desmond turns, Charlie hits him with an oar. He then places him neatly on the canoe.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You and I both know... you're not supposed to take my place, brother.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Grabbing the weight belt, Charlie pauses and cries. He then dives in, sinking fast. His shoe floats up as he continues down, past the side of the underwater station and underneath. Letting go of the weight belt, he begins to struggle for air, gasping. He sees the moon pool and manages to reach it, making it to the surface. He gasps for air and sees a large room, not flooded. Seeing the side, he pulls himself up onto a walkway.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[Laughs and pants] I'm alive. AH! I'm alive!!!!
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A door opens and two women run out, both with guns. A light comes on, and one woman runs to Charlie and points her gun right at his face. He makes a weak smile.]
