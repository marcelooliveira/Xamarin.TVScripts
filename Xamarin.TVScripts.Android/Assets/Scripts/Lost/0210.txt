4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Matt Earl Beesley
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a group of Nigerian kids playing soccer in a village. A truck full of thugs speeds into the village as Young Eko, wearing a cross, looks on worriedly. The thugs get out of the truck with guns and herd the children together.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG	[Subtitle: Get the children.]
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG #2	[Subtitle: All of you! Let's go!
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG	[Subtitle: Be quiet!]
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG #2	[To the adults] [Subtitle: All of you people! Out of here!]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A priest come running out of the church.]
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	PRIEST	Don't take anymore of the children.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[One of the thugs knocks the priest to the ground with the butt of his rifle.]
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG #2	[Subtitle: Grab the old man.]
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A balding man is brought forward and forced to his knees.]
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG	[Subtitle: Get the little one. Yes, the little one!]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The Thug Captain takes a gun out of his holster and walks over to a small boy, Eko's younger brother, Yemi. He grabs Yemi and shoves the gun in his hands and points the gun at the old man. Eko looks on helplessly.]
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG CAPTAIN	[English] Kill him. Shoot him. Now.
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The villagers look on as Yemi holds the gun pointed at the old man.]
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG CAPTAIN	Shoot him! Do it!
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Yemi continues to shakily point the gun. Eko runs up, grabs the gun, and shoots the old man. The Thug Captain grabs the gun away from young Eko.]
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG CAPTAIN	What's you're name, boy? What's you're name, boy!?
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YOUNG EKO	Eko.
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	THUG CAPTAIN	[laughing] Look at Mr. Eko. No hesitation. A born killer. [He puts his arm around Eko's shoulder] Come. [He yanks the cross from around Eko's neck and tosses it to the ground] You won't need that anymore.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The Thug Captain leads Eko off to the truck to leave, as Yemi picks up the cross.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Eko is carving the names of books of the bible onto his stick with some chapter numbers and the word "hateth."]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[off camera at first, holding the baby] What are you writing?
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Things I need to remember.
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Do you mind if I sit?
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Please.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Thanks. So you're Eko, huh?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yes.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Claire; and this is Aaron.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Aaron? The brother of Moses?
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, that must have been tough to live up to, right? The pressure of everyone saying, "Why can't you be more like your brother, Moses."
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yes, I'm sure it was. Why did you choose it -- Aaron?
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I just liked it.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Aaron was a great man. Moses had great difficulty speaking so it was Aaron who spoke for him.
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	So you're religious, huh? You should speak to Charlie. He doesn't want to admit he's religious, but he carries around a statue of the Virgin Mary.
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Statue?
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Yeah, he says he found it on the island. Weird, right?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	May I see it?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Close up of the statue. Eko and Claire are at Claire's emcampment on the beach. Eko is upset.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Where did he find this?
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	He said he found it in the jungle.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Where in the jungle?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I don't know.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[quite upset] Where?!
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Look, what are you -- it's just a statue.
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Just a statue?
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko puts the statue on a little table and breaks it with his stick. He shows her the heroin inside.]
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Where is Charlie?
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the combination to the gun vault being opened (using the numbers 25 & 29) by Locke. Locke opens the vault door and starts using a screwdriver on the other side of the lock.]
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[entering] You breaking in or breaking out?
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I used to love those old silent movies where the robbers would crack a combination lock with their ear pressed up against the safe. And the money they stole was always in a white bag with a big dollar sign on it.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Silent movies, huh? You're not that old, man.
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm old enough.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You set the combination?
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	With the new folks joining us I figure we better limit people's access to the guns. Can't have just anyone who wants one walk in and help themselves -- which I'm guessing is why you're here, Michael.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin and Charlie are at the shore. Jin is trying to fish with a net. Charlie is holding a homemade fishing pole under his arm and singing.]
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[singing] He's got wit he's got charm/But when he gets rough he'll break your arm/He's got taste, manners and grace/But when he gets rough he'll slit your face/He'll buy you jewels, expensive shoes, uh, oooo -- Hey Jin, do you like the Kinks? Kinks?
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Keens?
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	No, man, Kinks. Kinks with a "k" at the end. A kicking ka. Kinks. You know, [singing again] Once you're in love, you're no getting out ha-a-a-a so look out. It's a good tune, Jin. [Singing] Look out.
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Motioning for Charlie to go away, walk down the beach.] Ã«â€žË†Ã«â€¢Å’Ã«Â¬Â¸Ã¬â€”Â Ã«Â¬Â¼ÃªÂ³Â ÃªÂ¸Â°ÃªÂ°â‚¬ Ã«â€¹Â¤ Ã«Ââ€žÃ«Â§ÂÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã¬Å¾â€“Ã¬â€¢â€ž!
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, thank you very much, Jin. I do have a beautiful voice, don't I?
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin looks over at something and Charlie turns his head. We see Eko walking intently toward them.]
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[to Charlie, holding a piece of the statue] Where did you find this?
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What happened?
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Where did you find it?
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	In the jungle. I found it in the jungle.
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Take me there.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â„¢Å“ ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å¾Ëœ?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[to Jin] This is not your business. [to Charlie] I want you to take me to where you found it.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, fine. Yeah, we'll go for a stroll -- there's nothing there. We'll go first thing in the morning, alright?
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	We're going now.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Okay, let me go tell Claire so she doesn't get the wrong idea. Wait here --
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Tell her on your way.
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a car pull up in a village. Two thugs get out. Then we see the adult Eko emerge from the car and scope out his surroundings. Scene switches to Inside one of the buildings in the village. We see a duffel bag dropped on the ground and Eko sitting across from two Moroccans.]
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	[to a boy] Get us some beers. Go.
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Where did you find this?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	What does it matter?
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[One of Eko's men, Goldie, pulls a bag of heroin out of the duffel bag and put it on the table. Eko picks it up.]
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Same in the other bag?
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	Yes.
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko pulls out a huge knife, punctures the bag of heroin and tastes it.]
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Fifty.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	Fifty what?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[One of Eko's men puts some money on the table.]
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Fifty is what I will pay you in exchange for the favor you are asking me to do.
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	A favor?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You have a large quantity of heroin in a country that has no poppies and no market for its sale. Your drugs are of no value here, so you must get them out. The borders are all guarded by the military so you must fly. But as I'm sure you are aware the only private planes currently allowed into the air are either U.N. aid or the Catholic missionaries. And so you have come to me for a favor. I will buy your heroin -- for 50.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Tough Moroccan says something to Moroccan #2 in Arabic; they stand.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	It is true what they say about you.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	And what is that?
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	TOUGH MOROCCAN	You have no soul.
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko laughs briefly and suddenly kills both men with a swipe of his knife across their necks. The boy drops a beer, and Eko's men point their guns at the boy.]
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[to his men] No. [To the boy] Go. Go. And tell your friends that I let you live -- that Mr. Eko let you live.
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - We see Claire picking up pieces of the broken Mary statue. Charlie and Eko enter.]
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[to Eko] Just give me a second, okay? [To Claire] Hi, Claire. What happened to the statue?
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Don't play stupid, Charlie.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[pulling baggies of heroin out of her pocket] What's this? Because this was in your little statue. And, unless I'm mistaken I seem to remember you saying you're a drug addict.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I didn't know. [Claire rolls her eyes.] Look, it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know? Claire, I'm not using. [Charlie starts breaking open the baggies and dumping the heroin in the sand] Look, you believe me now? I don't -- care.
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Someone's waiting for you.
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A jar of DHARMA Ranch Composite Dressing sitting on a log. We see Locke teaching Michael how to shoot.]
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Got it?
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Got it.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Alright. Breath half-way out -- gently squeeze the trigger. Squeeze. [Michael pulls the trigger of the unloaded gun] Good.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	How'd you learn all this stuff?
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	My dad used to take me hunting.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hunting for what?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Birds mostly. Of course, birds don't shoot back.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah. I know people are talking -- thinking I'm going to go running off after Walt again.
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	If people are talking I'm not hearing it. But if I was, I'd say it's not a very smart plan.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, it's not.
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[loading the gun] Let's try one for real.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael takes a shot and hits the jar of dressing.]
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Bravo.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Eko walking in the jungle.]
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Well done with Claire, mate. You got me in a lot of trouble there, so thanks for that. Hope you're happy. Oh, that's right, you don't do happy. [They stop at a tree] Alright, well, we're here. I found it right here, right by that tree.
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You found it here?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, found it here.
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You're lying.
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know what? I don't even know you. You asked to see where I found it. This is where I found it. We're done. Have a nice hike.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie starts to walk away, but Eko grabs him by the neck and shoves him up against the tree.]
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You did not find the statue here. Take me to the plane.
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Eko walking in the jungle.]
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	How'd you know about the plane, man? It's old, you know. It's been out in the jungle for years. Of course, you would know that - you know everything.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Why did you lie to the girl?
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You told her you did not know what was inside the statue.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I wasn't lying.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Then what is the wrong idea?
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	When I showed you the broken pieces of plaster, you said you did not want her to get the wrong idea. What is the wrong idea?
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I don't have to tell you anything, man. You come traipsing across the island, and what, suddenly now you're in charge? You want me to take you to your plane? You best start treating me with some respect. I'm not just some guy you can just...
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko suddenly looks into the jungle and we see the smokey monster "fly" by in the distance. Charlie looks too late and doesn't see it.]
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What? What?
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Let's go.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[under his breath] Yes, sir.
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - In the village from the first scene, we see the church, and a woman selling the Virgin Mary statues out front. Eko approaches.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	NIGERIAN WOMAN	Sir! Sir, if you buy a statue the money will buy polio vaccine for the village. 200 Naira, sir.
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	[appearing] What are you doing here?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I have come to give my confession.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	[smiling] Hello, Eko.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[smiling] Hello, brother.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the church.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	So I come to visit you for the first time in 3 years and you won't hear my confession? You know, Monsignor would have said he failed to raise a proper Catholic boy.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Well, why waste your time confessing. It won't help you.
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	It won't?
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	No, for confession to mean something you must have a penitent heart.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You and your guilt, Yemi. I've only done what I needed to do to survive. How is that a sin?
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	You may live far from here, but that doesn't mean I haven't heard of who you are and what you have done.
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko reaches in Yemi's priest's shirt and pulls out the cross (the one that Eko wore as a boy).]
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Have you forgotten how you got that cross, brother -- the day they took me? Is what I did that day a sin? Or is it forgiven because it was you that was saved?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Why are you here, Eko?
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I have come to help you. I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country. I would like to use one of your church relief flights to transport it.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Merchandise? You mean drugs.
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	It is not my normal business, Yemi. We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria so that they cannot be used by our people. And the money -- you'll have all the money to buy your vaccine. God has given us this opportunity; we should not turn our back on it.
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	God did not bring you here, Eko. Your own greed did. I will always love you, but I will not help you. It's good to see you again, brother. [He exits leaving Eko sitting in the church.]
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Kate is giving Sawyer a haircut.]
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	A little close to the ear, Freckles. You sure you know what you're doing?
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Would you please turn your head.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Why, you ain't got a clean enough shot at my neck? I can cut my own damn hair.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You know, you don't have to be belligerent just for belligerent's sake. Everyone loves you now.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Bull puckey.
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Hurley and Michael walking by.]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	Yo, Sawyer, glad you're back, man.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[not loud enough for Hurley to hear] Yo yourself, Pillsbury.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	See?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey, Kate? Hey, Locke said you were on hatch duty later. I was wondering if, uh, you mind if I go instead?
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	You want my shift?
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Help me take my mind off things.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Sure, it's all yours.
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Thanks, appreciate it. [He hesitates a moment, then to Sawyer] Glad you're okay, man.
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah. [to Kate] Don't even say anything.
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Eko walking in the jungle.]
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Alright, time to take a break.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You just had a break.
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie stops and gets some water.]
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm not what you think I am.
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	And what do I think you are?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It was my brother's fault.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Sorry?
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	It was his fault I became an addict. He started with the heroin. I tried to make him stop. You don't know me, man. I was a good person. I was an alter boy. Alright, I knew what was in that statue, it doesn't mean I needed what was inside it. So don't judge me, man.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko suddenly sees something in the trees beyond Charlie and goes to investigate.]
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What? What's that? It's a parachute.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko looks around and see the Nigerian "priest" skeleton that Boone and Locke found in a previous episode.]
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Is that a priest?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko reaches to pull open the priest's shirt.]
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What are you doing?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko opens the shirt but we just see the decaying body. He looks at the skull and notices a gold tooth.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You know that guy?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yes, this man saved my life.
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eko kneeling and praying over the body with Charlie standing a little bit away.]
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[while Eko's praying] He saved your life, huh? Sure, that makes sense. He takes off in a plane in Nigeria -- we're out in the middle of the South Pacific -- that makes all the sense in the world.
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko finishes praying, Charlie picks up Eko's stick.]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	This is scripture written here. You're a priest. You're a priest, right? He's a priest and you're a priest, too, right?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Eko bursts into his brother's church and opens the curtain of the confessional where his brother is.]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I need to talk to you.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	I'm in the middle of a confession.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	It cannot wait.
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	[to the confessor] Bless you. [To the other people in the church] God be with you all and please come back in the morning. [A woman looks back at him] It's okay. [To Eko] How dare you come here and disrupt my work?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Have you reconsidered?
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	What?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	My request?
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Flying drugs under the cover of the church? How is that something I could ever reconsider? [He sees one of Eko's men handling the candles on the altar] Look, hey, don't touch those!
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I'm going to make this easy for you. You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Make you priests?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Just sign these ordination documents and I will give you the money for the vaccines.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Leave this church now, Eko. Go. Now.
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yemi, I understand that you live in a world where righteousness and evil seem very far apart, but that is not the real world. I am your brother and I would never do anything to hurt you, but my friends -- if you do not do what I ask -- they will burn this church to the ground. Is that worth less than the price of your name on a piece of paper? Think of the lives you will save.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[After a long stare down, Yemi snatches the paper out of Eko's hand and makes to sign the ordination documents.]
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	How many of the statues do you have left? The Virgin Mary statues, how many?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	I don't know -- three hundred.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I will take all of them.
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko offers a pile of money to his brother who doesn't take it. Eko sets it down on the bible next to him.]
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I guess we are both sinners now.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Perhaps we are but God will forgive me, Eko.
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Charlie and Eko walking in the jungle. Charlie is looking around, perplexed.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Uh, I'm lost. It was dark. I was following Sayid. Right afterwards a big bag of rocks fell on my head so I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty with the geography.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Climb that tree.
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	What?
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Climb that tree and perhaps you will be able to get your bearings or spot the plane.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	You climb it. What if I don't? You going to beat me with your Jesus stick? I find it a little odd that your scripture stick has dried blood on it.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Are you going to climb that tree, or not?
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[reluctantly going to the tree] What kind of priest are you, anyway?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie climbs up the tree with some difficulty.]
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	You need to get higher.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Wonderful. Thank you.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Eko surveying his surroundings, as Charlie climbs higher in the tree. Suddenly the ground explodes a little ways off from Eko and we hear the monster sounds.]
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Eko, run! Run!
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We get a monster POV shot as if "flies" toward Eko stopping right in front of his face while Charlie looks on. Then we see a shot from above/Charlie's POV of Eko standing in front of a long "cloud" of the black smokey looking monster. The camera swings around so it's in the black "smoke" pointing toward Eko. Inside it there are flashes of light, images. The camera continues its arc through the black "smoke" and comes out the other side. We see another shot from above as the monster gathers itself and "flies" off and into the ground. Eko looks up at Charlie.]
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie is down from the tree and goes to Eko.]
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Did you see it?
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah, I saw it. What the bloody hell did you do?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I did nothing.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Most people, when they see a creature made of swirling black smoke, they run.
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	I was not afraid of it.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I can see that. That thing kills people.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Did you see the plane?
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yes, I saw your plane. It's about a kilometer that way.
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[leaving] Thank you.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	[quickly following] Wait!
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Inside the hatch we see Michael looking around to make sure no one is there. He goes into the computer room and tries to type but nothing happens.]
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Come on. Come on. Where are you?
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly something appears on the monitor.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	Dad?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] Are you OK?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	Yes. Are you alone?
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] Yes.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	Can't talk long. They're coming back soon.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[typing] Where are you?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MONITOR	You need to com...
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The shot changes to Michael's face, reading. Suddenly Jack enters just as Michael was about to type something.]
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hey, Michael.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey.
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How're you doing?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm good, thanks.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You down here alone?
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, Hurley's supposed to be here, but, uh, I guess he's running late.
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack grabs a chair and sits down, but he can't see the monitor screen.]
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, listen, uh, no one's forgotten about Walt.
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I can't -- I don't have any idea what you must be going through, but I just want you to know that as soon as we can we're going to figure a way to go out and bring him back.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, thanks, man. Thanks. [Michael looks toward the computer screen.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You okay?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, fine.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack gets up and crosses behind Michael. We see that the screen is blank. Jack puts his hand on Michael's shoulder.]
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Well, I'll leave you to it then.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Thanks.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko and Charlie walking in the jungle. They come upon the plane.]
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - We see a plane idling on a runway. Eko and Goldie, dressed as priests, are loading the drugs onto the plane. One of Eko's men, Olu, is standing guard and sees something.]
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	OLU	[shouldering his gun] Eko.
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a van driving up. Eko motions for his men to lower their guns. Yemi gets out of the van.]
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	What are you doing here, Yemi?
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	I came to stop you.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Go back to your church.
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Do not get on that plane, Eko. You saved my life once and now I'm here to save yours.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Save my life?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Look, if you get on that plane -- if you do this...
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Do what, Yemi?! Are you a prophet now?!
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	Please, Eko! Let me take your confession! Anything I can do, I will do! But please, don't go.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Suddenly a truck with soldiers comes speeding up.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	GOLDIE	He called the military!
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[to Yemi] You did this?
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	I did not tell them who was involved. Just leave the drugs and come back with me.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goldie and Olu start shooting at the military truck. The truck crashes to a stop and the soldiers start shooting back, killing Olu. Yemi runs in front.]
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	YEMI	[yelling at the soldiers] No! Stop! No more! No more!
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Yemi gets shot and Eko runs to him.]
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Yemi! No! No! [to Goldie] Help me get to the plane.
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Goldie gets Yemi into the plane. As Eko is trying to climb in, Goldie kicks him to the ground, closes the door and the plane flies away.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Eko goes inside the plane. He sees the statues, and his brother's blood. Then he sees a body. He opens the shirt and finds his cross. He holds the corpse and cries.]
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Forgive me, forgive me.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - At the runway, Eko is still on the ground, as a soldier approaches.]
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SOLDIER	[to Eko] Father? Are you okay, Father?
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Eko removes the cross from the body as Charlie approaches.]
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Eko? Who's that?
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	He's my brother.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm sorry.
598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eko places one of the Virgin Mary statues with his brother's body. He pulls a fuel line out of the plane's interior and douses the body with fuel. Eko emerges from the plane and gives a statue to Charlie.]
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	For the one I broke.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see the plane on fire with Eko and Charlie looking on.]
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	So, are you a priest or aren't you?
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	[putting the cross around his neck] Yes, I am. The Lord is my Shepard I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, I fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod, thy staff they comfort me.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The following lines are spoken by Eko as voice over on a sequence of Sun and Jin bringing a fish to Ana]
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	EKO	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a montage: Libby is struggling to build a shelter and Hurley comes to help her. Sawyer looks at his haircut in a mirror and teases Kate. Jack interrupts their flirting to give Sawyer a pill.]
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie approaches Claire as she's packing up his stuff.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You lied to me, Charlie.
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I know I did. I'm sorry. I just -- it made me feel safer to have it around.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Look, I can't have you around my baby, okay?
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Claire, I...
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	Charlie, I don't want you sleeping anywhere near us, okay?! Just go.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see Charlie walking in the dark with a torch. He stops and reveals a hiding place with a cache of Virgin Mary statues. He adds another one to his collection.]
