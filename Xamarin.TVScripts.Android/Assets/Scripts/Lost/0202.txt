6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WALT	Dad, please! Dad!
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt!
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pops up from underwater in front of the burning raft.]
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt! No! Walt!
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Mike!
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt!
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sawyer!
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jin!
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬â€¢Ë† Ã«Â³Â´Ã¬â€”Â¬, Ã¬â€“Â´Ã«â€Â¨Ã¬â€“Â´?
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt! Walt!
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer swims to a piece of the raft and pushes it toward Michael.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hang on Mike! Hang on Mike! Hang on!
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer grabs Michael as he's going under water, hauls him up onto the raft wreckage and starts pounding his chest to revive him.]
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Mike! Mike!
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke outside the hatch just as the light floodlight goes out.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Kate! Kate!
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He secures the rope and lowers himself down.]
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer hitting Michael's chest and then performing CPR until Michael revives.]
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where's Walt?
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't know.
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where is he?
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I don't know.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where the hell is my son? Walt!
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Michael is in a custody attorney's office.]
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	How'd you hurt your leg?
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Got hit by a car.
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Ow.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah.
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	So, this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	She's not my ex-wife, man. She's just -- Walt's mother. She, uh, Susan, she just got an new job in Rome -- the boyfriend -- they want to take Walt with them.
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Don't worry, I'm going to take very good care of you, Mr. Dawn.
68	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Dawson.
70	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Right, sorry, Dawson. So this boyfriend -- this is this guy Brian Porter?
72	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, why, what's it say?
74	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	It seems that Susan wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father so that Mr. Porter can adopt him.
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	She wants me to sign my son away?
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah. Listen, if you sign this document -- legally, he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street. You'll be giving up your paternal rights -- all of them.
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, so then, can I stop her from going?
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Well, I guess we could file an injunction so she couldn't leave the city, but-
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, that, that. I want to do that.
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Right. Um, Mr. Dawson, the fact that you came in through these doors -- that tells me something. It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford. If we go forward with this, it's going to take money. A lot of it, even at my rates. This is David and Goliath, so I've got to ask you -- are you sure you want to do this?
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They're not taking my son away.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Michael and Sawyer on the piece of raft wreckage.]
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Walt! Walt! [coughs] Walt!
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Mike, you should save your energy.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They took my son!
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, I saw that -- onto a boat which means he's not in shouting distance.
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You don't know that.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well, I got a pretty good sense. And even if he was, there's nothing you can do.
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	But if he can hear me, he knows that I'm alive -- that I'm coming for him -- that I'm going to get him back. Right now, all I've got is that maybe my son can hear me. Does that make any sense to you? Walt! Walt!
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Back at the hatch. Shot of the rope hung over the side, then Locke stepping in the water at the bottom.]
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Kate.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As he moves forward his shoes are squeaking so he takes them off. He sees the logo and moves into Desmond's living quarters. He hears Kate moaning, finding her on the ground.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Kate.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	John.
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Easy, easy, easy.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Behind you.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We hear a gun sound and Locke turns to find Desmond standing there with an assault rifle pointed at them.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Are you him? Are you him?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael and Sawyer on the raft wreckage.]
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jin! Jin! Jin!
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I thought we had to save our energy.
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, well, Jin's still out there in the water, so if it's okay by you, I'm going to keep shouting for him. Jin!
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Feeling guilty.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You made me fire that flare.
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I made you fire -- what, this is my fault?
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They took my son. They found us -- took Walt -- because you made me fire the flare.
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	At least Walt is on a boat -- probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa -- while we're on this piece-
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Get off my raft.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The raft is hit by something from below.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell is that?
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We can see a shark under water, swimming in front of the raft.]
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I see you managed to hold on to your best friend there [referring to Sawyer's gun]. That thing ain't going to work, anyway.
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It'll work.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You were under water.
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What do you know about guns, anyway, Hoss? It'll work. [He starts slipping cartridges out of the magazine] Bullets are dry, powder's dry -- if the powder's dry- [the raft is bumped by the shark again.]
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What the hell is that?
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It's a shark. It's only a shark.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It's only a shark? That's supposed to make me feel better? Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around -- your shoulder.
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then. Did you suddenly forget what happened? Why I got shot?
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Hey, how about a little gratitude here? I'm mean -- a thank you!
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Thank you? For what? For you trying to save your own ass?
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You want me off this raft? You got it.
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer starts paddling with his arm to get to another piece of raft wreckage which he climbs up on.]
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I was trying to save your damn kid.
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Michael and Susan meeting with lawyers.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	[Susan's lawyer] Let's talk about Walt, shall we, Mr. Dawson?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Uh, sure, okay.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	When was the last time you actually saw your son?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Um, about a year ago.
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	It was 14 months, actually.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Is that a question, Lizzy?
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	Why is that Mr. Dawson? Why so long?
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Susan took him to Amsterdam -- for work.
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	And you didn't have a problem with that?
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Excuse me?
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	Well, since she's now going to Rome and you're filing an injunction. It just seems a little inconsistent to me.
206	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Incon -- no. No, no, no, no.
208	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Michael, she's baiting - she's baiting you. Don't give her an answer.
210	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	She took him, though. I didn't want her to go.
212	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Michael, please don't talk.
214	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[to Susan] You said there was nothing I could do.
216	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	And you didn't do anything, did you?
218	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	He's not going to answer that question.
220	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	That's because there is no answer. You were in an accident recently, no?
222	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah.
224	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	You had several surgeries, spent weeks in a private hospital room, extensive rehabilitation. Who paid for all of that, Mr. Dawson?
226	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[to Susan] I didn't ask you for anything.
228	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	[to court reporter] Could the record reflect that Mr. Dawson acknowledged that Ms. Lloyd paid his bills?
230	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Susan! Tell them -- Susan, tell them that I didn't ask you for anything.
232	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	Please don't address my client directly.
234	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	But I didn't. [Michael's attorney interrupts him and whispers to him.]
236	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	Do you know what Walt's first words were, Mr. Dawson?
238	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm sorry, what?
240	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	His first words, do you know what they were?
242	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I -- no, I -- I wasn't there.
244	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	Do you know what his favorite food is? [Michael doesn't respond] Do you...
246	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No!
248	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ATTORNEY	Okay, this is unnecessary.
250	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No.
252	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	Well, for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr. Dawson.
254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm his father.
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LIZZY	I'm sorry, could you say that louder please -- just for the record.
258	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I'm his father.
260	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Michael and Sawyer each on their pieces of wreckage. Sawyer is ripping his shirt where his bullet wound is.]
262	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Are you crazy? You're going to take a bullet out with your bare hands?
264	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got a better idea? [Michael doesn't respond] Then go to hell.
266	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You're never going to be able to do it by yourself.
268	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I thought we parted ways, Mike.
270	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	We're caught in the same current.
272	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Still talking.
274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer digs in the wound, screaming, and pulls the bullet out while Michael looks on.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You got a Band-aid?
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the hatch.]
280	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Are you -- are you him?
282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes. Yes I am.
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I can't believe it. You're finally here.
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well, here I am.
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Who's she?
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	She's with me.
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What did one snowman say to the other snowman?
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't know what you're talking about.
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Get rid of the knife. You're not him.
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[discarding his knife] We didn't come here to hurt you.
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Yeah, then why did you come?
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	We were in a plane crash.
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Were you now? And when was that?
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	44 days ago.
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	44 days? Move.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How long have you been down here?
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Shut it. [He throws a rope to Kate] Tie him up. Do it!
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Wait. Wait, wait -- you're tying up the wrong person.
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How's that, brother?
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It's pointless to tie me up, I'm not dangerous. But her, she's a fugitive.
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So, what does that make you then, brother?
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm a regional collections manager for a cardboard manufacturer -- boxes primarily.
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	All right then, box man, tie her up.
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke reaches for Kate and she pulls away angrily.]
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Don't you dare touch me.
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Hey! You be good girl, right?
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke turns Kate around and starts tying her wrists.]
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What do you think you're doing?
336	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm doing what's best for all of us.
338	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke slips a knife in Kate's jeans.]
340	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Alright, bring her here.
342	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[struggling] Oh, hey, John, wait, hey. Wait!
344	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke puts her in a storage room and closes the door.]
346	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Hurley and Jack at the caves.]
348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	You're kidding, right? You're going back?
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Yeah.
352	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	HURLEY	What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?!
354	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I changed my mind.
356	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlie and Claire.]
358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	What do you suppose all that's about?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I reckon Jack's going to do something heroic. [Claire sighs and rolls her eyes] What?
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You always try to be funny when you don't want to answer a question.
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Try to be funny?
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	[finding the Virgin Mary statue] What's this?
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Oh, I found it in the jungle.
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	You found it?
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	Yeah. Be careful. Be careful with it. Here, take Aaron. [He hands the baby to Claire] You've got to be careful with it, you know. It's the Virgin Mary. She's holy.
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLAIRE	I didn't realize you were so religious.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLIE	I'm not. It's just, you know, it might come in handy. It'd be a nice thing to have around.
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael and Sawyer on their pieces of wreckage.]
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	It wasn't the flare. I said it wasn't the flare. Those people that did this -- at first I thought they were fisherman or pirates or something. Then I got a good look at their boat. You know anything about boats, Mike? A boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean -- water's coming over the side with the first little squall -- maybe got a range of 100 miles. Nope, a boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close -- like the Island. French chick said the Others were coming for a kid. I think they came, Mike.
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What?
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	He's the one they wanted -- why I got a bullet in my shoulder. Hell, Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Are you saying this is my fault?
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	That's what I'm saying.
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	They took my son because of you! They were sailing away!
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	They found us because they were looking for us, for Walt!
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Don't you ever say his name again, ever!
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh, what are you gonna do, splash me?
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael splashes Sawyer, and Sawyer's piece of wreckage breaks apart. Sawyer swims back over to Michael's piece of wreckage and climbs on.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Look, I know you-
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Shut up! Don't even -- you have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Susan alone in the lawyer's office as Michael enters.]
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Hi.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Where are your lawyers?
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Out. I told them I wanted to talk just you and me. But if you want yours I understand.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	No, it's okay.
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	I think you're going to win.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Excuse me?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	In court. I think you're going to keep me from leaving the country with Walt. I just have to ask you why?
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Why what?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Why are you doing this?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	He's my son.
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Since when, Michael? Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me, but in Rome I'll be senior partner at the firm. I'll be able to give Walt anything he needs. You're still on disability, Michael. You can't work. You're about to be evicted from your apartment.
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	You got your lawyers checking up on me, now?
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Well, of course I did. Just like you had your lawyers checking up on me. Nobody's winning here.
432	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Then stop.
434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself. You need to get healthy. You need to get back on your feet financially so you can get back to pursuing your art. You have rare talent as an artist, Michael. But how are you going to do that -- any of that -- and still be a part of Walt's life?
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I do it by doing it. Walt is my responsibility, too.
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Then let him go because it's not about you or me -- it's about him. I don't want to go court, Michael. So please just let him go.
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Back at the hatch. Kate struggles in the storage room to cut the ropes off her wrists. The room is filled with food supplies. Sees a vent, has an Apollo candy bar, and climbs up through the vent.]
442	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Scene changes to Locke and Desmond in the living quarters.]
444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	The pilot said we had lost radio contact, but by then we were already a thousand miles off course. Any search teams would have given up weeks ago.
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So you were traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles?
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes.
450	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	So the world is still out there?
452	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	As far as I know. Could you tell me your name?
454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	My name? My name is Desmond.
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Desmond, I'm John. You should know the gun is really unnecessary.
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Yeah, so I should just hand it over to you then, should I? How many of you are there?
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	43, but 4 sailed out this morning on a raft.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	A raft?
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That simulated sunlight -- is that because you never leave? Is there another way out?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	How many of your group have gotten sick.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Sick?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Sick, as in ill, as in dead!
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Is that why it says quarantine on the inside of the hatch...
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Answer the question.
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No one has. No one. No one is sick.
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The beeping signal is heard. Kate is shown moving through the ventilation ducts.]
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Get up. [They go to the computer room.] Stand right there. Do you know how to use this, box man?
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I haven't seen one of those in 20 years.
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Do you know how to use it?!
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Yes.
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Sit!
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[We see a number countdown move from 2:38 to 2:37 to 2:36.]
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Listen carefully, type in exactly what I tell you understand -- exactly, nothing else. 4, 8, 15... Did you hear that?
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	What?
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What did you just put in? What number did you just put in?!
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	15
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Right, 16, 23, 42. Now press execute.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[hesitating] What's going to happen?
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Just push it!
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke pushes the execute button, and the counter resets to 108:00]
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Off camera we hear Jack's voice.]
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate! Locke!
512	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Who the hell is that?
514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	That would be Jack.
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond pushing Locke through the hatch. He looks through the scope and sees Jack.]
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Who is he?
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	His, uh, his name is Jack. He's our doctor.
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	What is he doing here?
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	To be honest with you I'm a little surprised to see him.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Your doctor has a gun, brother. [He shoves Locke] Move. [He turns on the music] Make one sound and I'll shoot. Move.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Kate can see Jack in the computer room and calls out to him, but he can't hear her.]
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I wouldn't do that, Jack.
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Kate? What the hell did you...
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[still behind a wall holding a gun to Locke's head] Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Kate?
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack, it's okay.
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	I said drop it.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Where's Kate?!
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	She's fine. Just put down the...
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I'm not putting down anything!
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Desmond fires his gun which hits near where Kate is, in the vent.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	Do you want him to die? Put it down.
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Is this what you were talking about Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Jack, calm down.
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DESMOND	[moving behind Locke] Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael and Sawyer on the water. Sawyer sees one of the pontoons and tries to paddle the piece of wreckage over to it.]
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	What the hell is that? Part of the raft -- one of the pontoons. Stop paddling. Hey stop it. You're putting a strain on the binds; it's going to break us up. [Sawyer just keeps paddling.] Damn it, you're going to...
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The piece of raft starts to break apart and Sawyer ends up in the water.]
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey Sawyer! Climb up.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I do and we both sink. I'm going for the pontoon.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Don't be an idiot.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[handing Michael the gun] You see that toothy son of a bitch, you aim and squeeze, got it?
574	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Got it.
576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer swims for it, and the shark goes for him. Michael pulls the trigger but nothing happens. Michael fires again several more times and we see blood spray.]

580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer pops up on the other side of the pontoon.]
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Give me your hand.
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Michael helps Sawyer climb onto the pontoon, and climbs on himself.]
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flashback - Michael in a park. Susan and a young Walt enter.]

590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Hey.
592	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Hey, I'm sorry I'm late -- packing's been a disaster and the plane leaves first thing in the morning.
594	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Sure, no problem.
596	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Uh, you want to say hi, Walt?

600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Yes, sure, he's just really shy.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	[kneeling down to talk to Walt] Hey little man, look, I guess I can't call you that -- I mean, because look how big you are. So, you and I -- well, we're not going to see each other for a while, Walt. But you are going to have a great life. I know your mommy, she's going to take real good care of you. And Brian is going to take good care of you, too. But, you know what? I just want you to know that no matter where you go that I -- that your daddy -- yeah, your daddy -- he loves you very, very much. And I always will. Always, okay.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	I'm sorry -- this...
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	It's okay. Uh, hey, here [handing her the bag] -- just, you know -- you know, let him know it's from me -- sometime.
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUSAN	Okay. Goodbye, Michael.
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	Yeah, bye.

618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What?
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MICHAEL	I never should have brought him on the raft. I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get back my son.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	How about that? [They see land] The current brought us back. We're home.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer and Michael walk up on shore. They hear Jin yelling.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jin?
