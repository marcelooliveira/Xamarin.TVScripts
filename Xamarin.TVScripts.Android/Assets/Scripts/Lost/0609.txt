4	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	Directed by	Paul Edwards
6	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Locke's camp is seen through night vision goggles. Sawyer hands Kate a mug.]
8	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Want some cocoa?
10	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Where'd you find cocoa?
12	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I didn't. Pretend.
14	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke approaches Jin, who is bandaging his leg. The night vision switches off.]
16	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	How's the leg?
18	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Still hurts.
20	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You should leave the bandage off for a while. The air'll do it some good.
22	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I'll try that.
24	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You mind if I sit down?
26	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin nods and Locke sits.]
28	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I know you and I haven't had time to talk, but I was wondering if James had filled you in on what I showed him at the cliffs?
30	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	You mean the cave? The one with the names on the wall?
32	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Most of the names have been crossed off now. There are just a few left. Kwon is one of them.
34	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Claire eavesdrops on their conversation.]
36	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Does that mean me or Sun?
38	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Well Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that the only way we can leave the island is if all the names that haven't been crossed off go together.
40	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	But, Sun is not here...
42	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You just take care of that leg. I'm workin' on it.
44	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke gets up and walks away.]
46	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Sun waits in the airport as Jin cooperates with security.]
48	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SECURITY OFFICER	Alright Mr. Kwon, here's your suitcase and your watch.
50	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin waits for a moment.]
52	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Money?
54	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SECURITY OFFICER	I'm sorry, federal law says we have to confiscate the $25,000.
56	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Confiscate?
58	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SECURITY OFFICER	It means that if you want it back, you're gonna have to fill out the necessary paperwork.
60	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	And... the money...
62	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SECURITY OFFICER	You can exit right over there, sir.
64	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frustrated, Jin turns to Sun.]
66	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	ÃªÂ°â‚¬Ã¬Å¾Â. [Subtitle: Let's go.]

Your father gave it to me right before we left. He told me to deliver it with the watch. I don't ask your father questions. I do what he tells me.]
76	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time later, they approach the front desk at a hotel.]
78	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLERK	May I help you?
80	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun hands him some papers.]
82	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Paik.
84	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLERK	A reservation for Paik...
86	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He checks his computer.]
88	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLERK	Yes, I've got it right here. I've got a beautiful oceanview room for you on the eighth floor.
90	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Two room. Two! No marry.
92	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLERK	Oh...
94	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Kwon. Jin-Soo Kwon.
96	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLERK	I'm sorry, I apologize... yes, there is a separate room reservation for Kwon. Room 842. Here you go, sir.
98	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He hands Jin a room key.]
100	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CLERK	Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon... welcome to Los Angeles.
102	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Locke approaches Sayid, who is chopping wood.]
104	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm leavin' for a little while. I got an errand to run.
106	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	When will you be back?
108	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Morning. Keep an eye on the camp while I'm gone.
110	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke turns to leave.]
112	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't feel anything.
114	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Excuse me?
116	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	Anger. Happiness. Pain. I don't feel it anymore.
118	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Maybe that's best, Sayid. It'll help you get through what's coming.
120	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke walks into the jungle. Jin immediately starts gathering his things.]
122	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What're you doin', Hoss?
124	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I'm getting out of here before that thing comes back.
126	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What thing?
128	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Locke. And you're just sitting around here listening to whatever he tells you...
130	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I ain't listenin' to nobody! I already told you I have a deal with Widmore, so if you just--
132	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	It doesn't matter who you have a deal with! I've waited long enough. I'm going to find my wife.
134	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Find her where?
136	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Go back to the temple. And if she's not there I'll try the beach. But I will find Sun so stop trying to--
138	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin is silenced by a tranquilizer dart. Sawyer and the rest of Locke's camp soon follow. Armed men with night vision goggles step out of the jungle and examine the bodies.]
140	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	Is this the guy?
142	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Zoe stares down at Jin.]
144	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Yeah. Let's take him.
146	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They lift Jin's unconscious body.]
148	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Miles and Frank play cards on the beach.]
150	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Play your card, captain.
152	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Frank throws down a card. Nearby, Ben watches Ilana clean her rifle.]
154	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Now what?
156	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	We wait.
158	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Wait... for what?
160	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	For Richard to come back.
162	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	You'll forgive my skepticism, but... the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle was that we were all in Hell and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next! In fact, I would bet money we never see him again!
164	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Hugo will find him. He will track him down and bring him back.
166	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease, I'm not sure Hurley can track anything...
168	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LAPIDUS	Hey, don't talk about bacon.
170	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ILANA	Jacob has never lied to me before. If he said Richard knows what to do, then Richard knows what to do. He'll come back. And until then, we wait.
172	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun throws a piece of fruit in anger, then stabs a knife into the table. She storms off.]
174	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A few moments later, Jack finds her pulling weeds in her garden.]
176	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	How are the tomatoes?
178	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Dead.
180	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I remember when you first planted this here. Feels like a hundred years ago...
182	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun remains silent.]
184	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You don't believe Alpert's coming back, do you?
186	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I don't care if he comes back.
188	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What about us... being candidates?
190	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	What about it?
192	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Hurley took me to a lighthouse. To Jacob's lighthouse. And there was a mirror. And all around it there were... there were hundreds of names written down.
194	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I don't care. I don't care about Alpert, or being a candidate.
196	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sun... there was a reason why we were--
198	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I don't want to hear about how this is our purpose or destiny! I just want you to go away and leave me alone!
200	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack walks away as Sun cries.]
202	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash sideways - Jin knocks on the door of Sun's hotel room, she answers.]
204	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã¬Â§â€žÃ¬Ë†Ëœ Ã¬â€Â¨... Ã«Â­ÂÃ­â€¢ËœÃ«Å â€ ÃªÂ±Â°Ã¬â€”ÂÃ¬Å¡â€? [Subtitle: Jin... what are you doing?]

Just hold still okay. I'm gonna strap you in here just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you, I can't have you freaking out. I don't think you realise how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out that you were doing his little girl. That other twenty five that you were supposed to deliver, that was my fee for popping you. From what I hear, now anyone who works for Paik knows the cardinal rule - hands off the boss's daughter. But you, you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants.

702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	WIDMORE	Her name is Ji Yeon. Your daughter. I understand you've never seen her before. I have a daughter too. I know what it's like to be kept apart. I understand the one thing you want is to be reunited with your wife and daughter. But it would be short lived. If that thing masquerading as John Locke ever got off this island, your wife, your daughter, my daughter, everyone we know and love - would simply cease to be. I came here to make sure that doesn't happen.

736	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KEAMY	Look behind you, you idiot.
738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin has a pistol against Mikhail's neck.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã¬Â´Â Ã«â€šÂ´Ã«Â Â¤Ã«â€ â€. [Subtitle: Drop your gun!]

744	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Ã«Â²â€žÃ«Â¦Â¬Ã«ÂÂ¼ÃªÂ³ ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å¾Â¬Ã¬Â§â‚¬. Ã¬â€“Â´Ã¬â€žÅ“! Ã¬â€žÂ , Ã¬Â â‚¬Ã«Â¦Â¬ ÃªÂ°â‚¬. ÃªÂ·â‚¬ Ã«Â¨Â¹Ã¬â€”Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´, Ã¬ÂÂ´ Ã¬Æ’Ë†Ã«ÂÂ¼Ã¬â€¢Â¼?

746	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MIKHAIL	ÃªÂ·Â¸Ã«Å¸Â¬Ã¬Â§â€ž Ã«ÂªÂ» Ã­â€¢Â ÃªÂ±Â¸. Ã¬Â£Â½Ã¬ÂÂ´Ã«Â Â¤ÃªÂ³ Ã­â€“Ë†Ã«â€¹Â¤Ã«Â©Â´ Ã«Â²Å’Ã¬ÂÂ¨ Ã¬ÂË†ÃªÂ²Â Ã¬Â§â‚¬. [Subtitle: No I don't think so...because if you were the person who did this? [sic] you would've shot me already.]
748	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Mikhail spins round and hits Jin, several wild shots are fired as they struggle over the gun, Mikhail runs and grabs a kitchen knife, Jin shoots him dead. We see he has been shot through the right eye. Sun starts gasping. Jin runs over and sees blood on her hands. She appears to be shot in the abdomen.]
750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Subtitle: Sun! Ohmygod! Ohmygod! I'm going to get you some help! You're going to be all right...]
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He carries her out of the kitchen.]
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Ã«â€šËœ Ã¬Å¾â€žÃ¬â€¹Â Ã­â€“Ë†Ã¬â€“Â´... [Subtitle: I'm pregnant...]
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sun is at a beach campfire. Jack approaches.]
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Brought you a couple of things. Thinking about a patient that I had during my residency. Car crash, banged his head, when he woke up he couldn't talk. The guy was frustrated, I mean, who wouldn't be. Then one of the nurses said "just because he can't speak, doesn't mean that he can't write". Think you can give it a try?
760	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack hands Sun a pen and notebook. Sun writes "Yes".]
762	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Take a little longer to get your point across, but at least you have your voice back. Went back out to your garden to see if he was there. He wasn't. I found this.
764	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jack takes a tomato from his bag.]
766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	That's one stubborn tomato. Guess no-one told it it was supposed to die.
768	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun writes "Sorry" and a smiley face.]
770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Don't worry about it. Not the first person to tell me to leave them alone.
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They smile.]
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Locke - what did he say to you?
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun writes "He said he had Jin".]
778	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Why didn't you go with him?
780	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun writes "I don't trust him".]
782	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	You trust me?
784	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun nods.]
786	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sun, come with us and I'll help you find Jin. I'll help you find him and I'll get you both on that plane and as far away from this island as you can get. I promise.
788	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They shake hands.]
790	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Over in Locke's camp, Kate is at another campfire. Sawyer approaches.]
792	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where'd you go?
794	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What?
796	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Looked like your brain took a little stroll.
798	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Why aren't you worried, James?
800	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I am worried. Just really good at pretending I ain't. But I got a feeling this is almost over. 'Cause if Locke rode over there on a boat with Sayid, then Charlie Widmore blew him right out of the water.
802	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	What if he didn't?
804	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well then we're screwed six ways from sun--
806	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He is interrupted by Locke approaching.]
808	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Oh Hell.
810	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	He's alone.
812	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Thought you went over there to find Jin?
814	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	They said they didn't have him.
816	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	And you believed that?
818	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No.
820	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Where's Sayid? You lose him too?
822	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	When you were over there James, you mentioned that Widmore had someone guarding a room on his submarine. Guarding something that he didn't want you to see?
824	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Yeah, so?
826	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't like secrets.
828	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke leaves.]
830	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On Hydra Island, Sayid swims up to the submarine. Zoe and Seamus are dragging someone out of the hatch and onto the jetty.]
832	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	The guy can hardly stand.
834	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Well what do you expect?
836	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sayid sees it is Desmond being dumped on the jetty. They silently recognise each other.]
838	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	How much did you give him?
840	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ZOE	Obviously I gave him too much but we needed him knocked out for the trip. I'm not a nurse. Come on, get him up.
842	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SEAMUS	Let's go Mr. Hume.
844	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They begin carrying him away.]
