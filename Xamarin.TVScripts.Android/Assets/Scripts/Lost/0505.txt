254	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBERT	What was that thing?!
256	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The team collect themselves and stand up.]

274	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	What's wrong? [As Jin collapses to his knees in agony.]
276	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Some time in the future. Jin is alone at the Temple. He finds Montand's severed arm with approximately two months of decay. He leaves, climbs a hill and finds some plants with drinking water in their leaves. Looking around, he sees smoke in the distance. He investigates, and finds a small fire on the beach. There is no one around. He finds a music box - Danielle's music box. He rummages around the bags and things. He finds two dead bodies covered with flies and with bullet wounds. They are LaCombe and Brennan. He hears shouting in the distance and sneaks up. It is Danielle holding Robert at gunpoint.]
278	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Laisse-la! Pose-la! Pose ton arme! [Leave it! Put your gun down!]

282	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	T'es pas Robert! T'es changÃƒÂ©! Cette machine t'as changÃƒÂ©! [You're not Robert, you've changed, that thing has changed you!]
284	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBERT	Danielle, je t'en prie. Pose ton arme. Je t'aime, pourquoi tu agis comme ÃƒÂ§a? [Danielle, please, put down your gun. I love you, why are you acting like this?]
286	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	Parce que t'es pas Robert. T'es malade. Ce monstre t'a rendu malade. [Because you're not Robert. You're sick. That monster made you sick.]
288	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBERT	Mais il n'y a pas de monstre. C'est un systÃƒÂ¨me de sÃƒÂ©curitÃƒÂ© qui garde ce temple, c'est tout. [There is no monster. It's a security system that guards the temple, that's all.]
290	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBERT	Maintenant, pose ton fusil. [Now put down your gun.]
292	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle hesitates.]
294	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ROBERT	Je t'aime, Danielle. Je ne veux que rien nous arrive. A toi, et Ãƒ notre bÃƒÂ©bÃƒÂ©. Je t'en supplie, fais pas ÃƒÂ§a. [I love you, Danielle. I don't want anything to happen to us. To you, and to our baby. Please don't do this.]
296	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle slowly lowers her gun. Suddenly, Robert cocks his gun and fires, but it does not work. Danielle shoots Robert in the head.]
298	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No!
300	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle immediately turns to him.]
302	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIELLE	You! You disappeared! Are you sick too? You're a carrier?
304	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No! No, please, wait!
306	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Danielle chases Jin away, firing. Another time flash occurs. Disoriented, Jin falls down a small hill. He collects himself, and hears another gun cocked behind him.]
308	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN'S VOICE	Turn around slowly.
310	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin turns to find Sawyer.]
312	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Jin?
314	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Sawyer?
316	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[They hug.]
318	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	I thought you were on that boat, I thought you were dead!
320	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No, no, I... in water.
322	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Well what do you say!
324	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The rest of the group catch up. Jin looks through the faces.]
326	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Where is Sun?
328	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer's group rests by a stream. Miles and Daniel sit near each other.]
330	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	[To Daniel] Where'd that guy come from? I thought he was on the boat.
332	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	[To Miles] The blast must've thrown him in the water. He's been moving with every flash, just like us.
334	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Explaining to Jin] Every time the sky lights up, we... move through time.

348	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Obviously.
350	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Tell him I'm sure. But none of it will matter if we don't make it to the Orchid.

358	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[To Locke] Bring Sun back? Why you bring her back?
360	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Because she never should've left.
362	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Off-Island - Sun continues to point her gun at Ben.]
364	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	I've spent the last 3 years thinking... believing that he was dead. You say you have proof that he's not. I want to see it.
366	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Why don't you put down the gun. No one wants it to go off.
368	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	How do you know he's alive?
370	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	There's someone--someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them, and I'll show you the proof.
372	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Someone? Who?
374	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	The same person that's going to show us how to get back to the Island.
376	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	[To Jack] Is that what this is about? You knew about this?
378	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	No, no, I was...
380	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	And that is why you're pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?
382	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	I wasn't pretending anything...
384	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	This is insane, you guys are crazy.
386	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Kate...
388	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	KATE	Jack, don't! [Kate leaves]
390	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Sayid, where are you going?
392	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAYID	I don't want any part of this. And if I see you, or him again, it will be extremely unpleasant for all of us. [Sayid leaves]
394	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	30 minutes, Sun. We can be there in 30 minutes. And you'll have proof--proof that he's alive. Or you can shoot me and never know.
396	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Let's go.
398	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Sawyer's group trudges through the jungle, led by Locke, on their way to the location of the Orchid.]
400	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[To Locke] How far?
402	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Just over the next ridge.
404	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	How you will leave the Island?
406	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I'm not sure yet.
408	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	I'll go with you.
410	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	It doesn't work like that. It's a one man job.
412	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Why?
414	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't know why, Jin, it just is. But I promise I'll bring Sun back.
416	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	[To Charlotte] You okay? Want to take a break?
418	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Let's just get there.
420	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	So... you speak any other languages?
422	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Just Klingon. Dan, is this gonna work?
424	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	It... it does make empirical sense that if this started at the Orchid then that's where it's gotta stop. But as far as bringing back the people who left in order to stop these temporal shifts? That's where we leave science behind. [Charlotte stumbles] You okay?
426	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sounds of flash.]
428	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Oh no!
430	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash occurs--immediately followed again by the sounds of yet another oncoming flash.]

434	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[Cries in pain] Ah!
436	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash--all the characters hold their heads in pain--then Charlotte collapses.]
438	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte! Charlotte!
440	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Looking at Juliet] Juliet...?

444	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	...you have a little... [touches under his own nose to indicate her nosebleed]
446	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	You too.
448	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte! Can you hear me? Charlotte, it's Daniel. Talk to me...

454	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[To Jin] Don't let them bring her back. No matter what--don't let them bring her back! This place is death!
456	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Off-Island - Jack and Sun riding along in Ben's van.]
458	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.
460	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Drily] I didn't account for traffic.
462	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	Sun, I'm sorry.
464	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Curtly] Sorry for what?
466	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	For leaving Jin behind. When we landed that chopper on the boat, everything was just happening so fast. I knew he was down below.  I should've waited for him.
468	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Why are you telling me this now, Jack? Are you going to ask me not to kill Ben if he's lying about my husband?
470	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	After what just he did to Kate - if you don't do it, Sun, I will.
472	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben slams on the brakes and pulls the van over.]
474	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JACK	What are you doing?!
476	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	[Shouting frustratedly] What I'm doing is helping you! And if you had any idea what I've had to do to keep you safe - to keep your friends safe - then you'd never stop thanking me! You wanna shoot me, then shoot me - but let's get on with it! What's it gonna be?
478	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[pause] Drive.
480	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben restarts the van and continues driving.]
482	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[On-Island - Charlotte lying on ground, with others surrounding her.]
484	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[In a small, childish voice] Why can't Daddy come with us?
486	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte, can you hear me?
488	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[Reproachfully, in an adult voice] You know what my mum would say about you marrying an American. [Suddenly confident] I know more about ancient Carthage than Hannibal himself.
490	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What the hell is she talking about?
492	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	I have no idea.
494	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Let's go - we have to keep moving.
496	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Alright. Somebody help me with Charlotte. We're going to have to carry her.
498	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No - she's going to hold us up.
500	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	We can't just leave her.
502	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Flashes are getting closer together. Maybe when your nose starts bleeding, you'll realize we gotta get out of Dodge now. We'll come back for her just as soon as we can.
504	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	No. No way. I'm not going to leave her behind.
506	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Let them go without me.
508	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	No, Charlotte, no, we're not going to leave you behind.
510	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Flash.]

514	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We have to move, now!
516	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	He's right, go!
518	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte...
520	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Just go!
522	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte...
524	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Oh, oh turn it up! I love Geronimo Jackson.
526	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[gently] We're running out of time, Dan.
528	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Go. I'm going to stay with her.
530	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	Let me ask you something, John. If we don't even know when the hell we are, what happens if the Orchid ain't around anymore?
532	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[In a knowing, clear voice] Look for the well. You'll find it at the well.
534	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[puzzled] I'll be sure and do that.
536	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Let's go.
538	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[A while later, Locke, Miles, Sawyer and Juliet trek on through the jungle. Miles quietly notices his nose bleeding as they walk.]
540	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	We're here.
542	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	Thank God! What are the odds that we would end up in the same time as this thing?
544	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Another flash occurs, after which the Orchid station is absent.]
546	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You just had to say something.
548	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[John notices something behind the group - an old stone well, with a rope hanging down into its depths. He peers down the well.]
550	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	How the hell did Charlotte know this was here?
552	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Charlotte and Daniel, by the stream.]
554	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	[Coughing] Daniel?
556	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Yes?
558	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	I've been here before.
560	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	You've been...been here before?
562	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	I grew up here...on the island. And there was this thing...this... DHARMA Initiative. And then...I moved away with my mum. Just my mum...and...I never saw my dad again. And then when I got back to England, I would...I would...ask my mum about this place, yeah? But she would say that it wasn't real...and that I'd made it up. That's why... I became an anthropologist. To find this island again. It's what...I've been searching for my whole life.
564	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte...why are you telling me this?
566	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Because I remember something now. When I was little, living here, there was this man... a crazy man, he really scared me. And he told me that I had to leave the island and never ever come back. He told me that if I came back I would die.
568	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Charlotte, I don't understand.
570	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHARLOTTE	Daniel - I think that man was you.
572	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[At the well. Locke tests the rope.]

576	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Uh-huh.
578	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	What exactly are you hoping to find?
580	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	A way off the island.
582	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You expecting a subway?
584	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Goodbye, James, Juliet, Miles... I'll see you when I get back.
586	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	No! Stop! You don't bring Sun back.
588	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	No, I have to bring them all back, that's... that's how it works.
590	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Incredulous] How you know?

598	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	This island is bad! You don't bring Sun back! You promise--you promise you don't bring my baby!
600	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All right, all right--you have my word.
602	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	Promise, John.
604	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Pause] I promise.
606	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Jin lets go of rope and knife.]
608	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I won't go to Sun, Jin, but she might find me. If she does, what do I tell her?
610	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JIN	[Thinks] You tell her I dead. You say I wash up. You bury me. [Removes his wedding band and holds it out to Locke.] Proof.
612	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Takes ring, nods.] I'll be back as soon as I can.
614	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke hoists himself up onto well wall and gingerly grabs onto rope.]
616	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	You sure you don't want us to lower you down?
618	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Where would be the fun in that? [Grins nervously]
620	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	John, if whatever you're attempting to do actually works... thank you.
622	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	You're welcome.
624	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[John swings onto rope and begins to descend, hand over hand. The others peer down after him. While John is only partway down the well, the sound of an approaching flash begins.]
626	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	Uh-oh.
628	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sounds become more intense, a bright light emanates from the well bottom. John grunts and struggles as Sawyer grabs onto the rope from above.]
630	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	John, dammit, hold on!
632	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[As flash occurs, John falls. Following flash, John lands on the hard rocks at the well bottom. He screams in agony. On the quiet surface, Sawyer grunts with exertion, clenching the rope tightly, his eyes shut.]
634	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MILES	[Looking at Sawyer] I think you can let go of that now.
636	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sawyer opens his eyes and looks down to see the end of the rope buried in the earth, with no sign of the rest of the well - or of Locke.]
638	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No... no no, no no!
640	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[He falls to his knees and claws at the ground with his hands.]
642	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Gently] James, stop.
644	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	No, no!
646	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	James, stop.
648	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SAWYER	[Frantically] C'mon and help me!
650	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	JULIET	[Calmly] James--we can't help him.
652	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daniel and Charlotte, by the stream. Charlotte coughs.]
654	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	Hold on... hold on... hold on... hold on... stay.... stay... stay with me... stay, okay? You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay. I've got a plan... I've got a plan. When we were back at the hatch, I talked to Desmond. I told him to find my mother. She can help us, Charlotte, she will help us!

670	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	DANIEL	[Quietly] Charlotte. Charlotte? Charlotte... No...!
672	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Daniel quietly weeps over Charlotte's body.]
674	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Bottom of well. Locke continues to scream in pain. He looks down and sees that his leg is seriously injured.]

682	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[The figure approaches in shadow, his back to Locke. He lights an old lamp. He turns around, revealing his face.]
684	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD	Hello, John.
686	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	[Amazed] You! What are you doing down here?

690	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I... I don't understand.
692	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	You came to see me in the cabin. You asked me how to save the island and I told you you had to move it. I said that you had to move it, John.
694	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	But Ben said he knew how to do it! He told me that I had to stay here and lead his people.
696	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Since when did listening to him get you anywhere worth a damn? The good news is that you're here now. You ready to go?
698	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	I don't... I don't... I... I don't know... what to do once I get there.

702	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Who is she?
704	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Her name is Eloise Hawking.

710	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	Richard said I was going to die.
712	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Well, I suppose that's why they call it sacrifice.
714	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	LOCKE	All right. I'm ready.
716	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Good. Now, on the other side of this column here is a wheel, slipped off its axis. All you have to do is give it a little push.

722	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke grunts in pain as he stands. As he rounds the column and enters the wheel chamber he sees flashes of green light illuminate the space. The pulses of light are accompanied by intense humming sounds. A large wooden wheel attempts to rotate forward, but skips backward, seemingly stuck in place.]
724	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	CHRISTIAN	Good luck John.
726	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Locke grabs one of the wheel's arms and pulls his weight against it. The wheel suddenly lurches forward with a clank, throwing John towards the wall. The light emanating from behind the wheel becomes increasingly intense and gradually fills the chamber.]

738	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Sun nods. Ben reaches into his pocket and pulls out Jin's wedding band, which he offers to Sun.]
740	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	Take it.
742	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[She takes it and looks at it in amazement. She reads the inscription.]

750	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	That's true, Jack. I went to see him. [To Sun] Jin gave it to him before he left the Island.
752	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	Why did he not tell me himself?
754	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	I don't know. Maybe he never had a chance before he died. I'm sorry I had to bring you here before I gave it to you, Sun. But all those people back on the Island--Jin included--need our help. There is a woman in this church and she can tell us how to get back to your husband. But we're running out of time, Sun.  So I need you to decide right now. Will you come with me?
756	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	SUN	[Pauses as she looks down at the ring in her hand.] Yes.
758	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	MAN'S VOICE	What are you doing here?

766	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Ben stares at Desmond, then turns around and walks briskly into the church. The others follow. They enter the church.]

770	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000		[Eloise lights a candle and turns to face them.]
772	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	Hello, Benjamin. [The group stares at her, as she surveys them.] I thought I said all of them.
774	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	BEN	This is all I could get on short notice.
776	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000	ELOISE	[Sighs] Well, I suppose it will have to do for now. All right! Let's get started.
